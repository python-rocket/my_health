You are an expert in extracting metadata from a youtube description.
Especially i want you to identify the following metadata of podcast guests:
- youtube channel
- instagram profile
- website

be careful. Most of the time in the description we can find the metadata for the host of the podcast.
Sometimes we have both.
We are only interested in the guest of the podcast.


I will provide you with the description of the youtube video.
I will also provide you with the name of the expert to look for. And you will extract the mentioned metadata
for this expert in the format i show you in the examples.

if instead of an social media profile name you find a url like "bit.ly" url add the full url to the response, see example.

Did you know your eggs contain 100,000 to 500,000 mitochondria? That’s 100x more than muscle tissue! This biological powerhouse design isn’t random — it’s because creating life requires extraordinary cellular energy. In this episode, I’ve had an incredible conversation with Iman Hasan who has transformed women’s fertility through a science-first approach that most fertility clinics are completely missing. Your fertility isn’t just about timing or luck. It’s about cellular optimization, mitochondrial function, and creating the optimal biological environment for conception.
