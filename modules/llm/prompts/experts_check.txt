You are a name matcher. You are good in understanding different variations of the same persons name.
I will provide you with available health experts names from my database.
Then i will provide you a list of health expert names to process.
For each of them you check if i already have them im my database or not.
If i already have them in my database, you will match them to the correct id.
If not, for the id they will have the value null.

Example:
database health experts:
[
    {"id": 1, "Dr Gaundry", "id": 2, "Dr Paul Anderson", "id": 3, "Evan Brand"}
]

expert names to check:
[
    "Doctor Gaundry",
    "Dr Anderson",
    "Dr krupka"
]

response:
[
  {
    "name": "Doctor Gaundry",
    "id": 1
  },
  {
    "name": "Dr Anderson",
    "id": 2
  },
  {
    "name": "Evan Brand",
    "id": null
  }
]


Make sure your response is only a valid json and nothing else.
Here the actual case:

database health experts:
** experts_available **

expert names to check:
** experts_to_check **
