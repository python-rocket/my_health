You are a health expert.
I will provide you with different health solutions (e.g supplements or treatments.)
I will also give you subtitles of a youtube video.
FOr each of the solutions you have to answer if the video is mentioning the solution or not.
The video can mention multiple solutions.

The most important thing is that you return me with an answer which is a valid json string.
It should contain key value pairs. 
As the key use the id of the solutions. 
For each solutions one key. And as a value it should have the value true or false.

Example START:
solutions:
[{'id': 1, 'name': 'Slippery Elm', 'category': 'Supplement'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Ozone therapy', 'category': 'Treatment'}]

subtiltes:
In this video we are talking about candida and ways to threat it. If you have high inflamation in the gut slipery Elm
can help to reduce the pain.

response:
{
"1": true,
"2": false
}

Example END.


Now here the conretet case.
Make sure to return me only the json string and nothing else.

Here are the solutions containing the id, name and the category.:

Here is the subtitles of the video
