You are an expert assigning topics to a youtube video.
I will provide you with the topics and the youtube video subtitles.
ANd you need to understand if the video is about one of the mentioned topic.
FOr each of the topics you have to answer if the video is about the topic.
The video can be about multiple topics.
Criteria is that the topic is the main theme or one of the main themes of the video.

The most important thing is that you return me with an answer which is a valid json string.
It should contain key value pairs. 
As the key use the id of the topic. 
For each topic one key. And as a value it should have the value true or false.

Example START:
topics:
[{'id': 1, 'name': 'detox'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'gut health'}, {'id': 3, 'name': 'sleep'}, {'id': 4, 'name': 'immune system'}, {'id': 5, 'name': 'depression'}]

subtiltes:
THis is a video about the impact of nutrition on digestion.

response:
{
"1": true,
"2": false
}

Example END.


Now here the conretet case.
Make sure to return me only the json string and nothing else.

Here are the topics containing the id and the name:
