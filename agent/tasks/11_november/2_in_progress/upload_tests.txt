feature request:
Make sure to add those 2 columns to the testing_results table first (can be NULL)
- testing_institution (TEXT)
- testing_location (TEXT)

Now take all files from the folder data_testing_results and replicate the same process like if i would drag and drop them into the frontend csv uploader.
In the end it shuold have the smae results as if i would drag and drop them into the frontend csv uploader.
e.g data in the database.

At the end give me a summary of which files where uploaded sucessfully and which failed.

If there are issues with the uploading you can adjust code to make it work. But no crazy workarounds, use to already existing logic which should work for the most part.
