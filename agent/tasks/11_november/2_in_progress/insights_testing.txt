feature request:
We have our testing results. 
Now i want to be able to see a change in values for a specifc testing object over time. 
e.g i want to see for cortisol how the value changed over time
Create a new tab in the frontend called insights.
There add a visualisation with dates on X and the value on Y.
Add a dropdown where i can choose any value available from the testing_results table column testing_objects.
If i choose for example cortisol it should display the visualisation with the different values over time.

Make sure to have in the frontend only the visualisation logic. 
But in the fastapi backend i want the logic to actually prepare the data used for the visualisation.
so there should be an endpoint providing the data for the X and Y axis. 
something like /inights/testing_results/?testing_object={}
--> And it should return the X values the Y values and also one unified unit label.
If lets say "cortisol" would have different unit labels for now as a quick fix just assume they are all the same unit (just choose any of the possible options). Add a logging warning that this should be changed in the future to make sure to convert correctly.
