feature request:
when running ask.py, it will use openai tools to answer the question.
For that it uses a function that allows all kind of sql queries to the database.
Currently if i ask a question it requres a lot of different requests to the database. And a lot of tool iterations.
I want to get this process faster and reduce time and tool use.
Here is what i want you to do:

0) Remove the ask.py and the api.py to the module "ai_doctor". Make sure to adjust paths in frontend too.

1)
run a sql query on my database to get all tables/views and their schemas and save into ai_doctor/ask/cache/db_schema.txt
Add here at the top also the timestamp of the extraction

2) Now always read in the schema and provide as an input into the llm/tools. But make sure to remove the instructions to always check the schema first, since we already provide it.


3) Add an input parameter which can change the maximum number of tool iterations.
Also make sure that we have an additional warning to the llm that only 2 more tool iterations are left.

4) Add an additional file ai_doctor/ask/instructions.txt
Add there the following text (you can correct grammar):

If i am asking you anything about a potential solutions (e.g a supplement or a treatment, a new habit), try to answer the following points if possible:
- what are different youtube channels and pubmed publifications say about it
- instructions about how to use it (dosage, amount, frequency)
- specific brand or products mentioned
- for who its good to use (e.g people with gut issues)
- side affects, risks, issues to be aware about (e.g die-off reactions when using candida treatment)
- for who its not good to use

5) On the frontend we have preferences which are injected into the LLM request using the ask endpoint, here we want to adjust:
Add in the frontend a switch to turn on and off preferences. Only if on they are added to the llm request.
Also for each preferencecs catecory at a switch so i can turn on and off specific categories (e.g turn on only pubmed, but turn off youtube channels)
If i use the general on/of button it should turn on of all other switches.
Only if a switch is on the specific preferences context should be added to the api request.

- Also in the frontend add some kind of element where i can choose "fast", "normal" and "thinking".
- when choosing fast it should limit the number of tool usages to 3. 
- For normal to 5. For thinking no parameter provided (back to default value of tool functions)
- So this value is passed to the api request and an input argument in the tools function.
