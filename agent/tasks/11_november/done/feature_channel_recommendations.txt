feature request:
- In the cockpit UI there should be top 3 channel recommendations displayed.
- The system uses the v_channel_relations table which shows which channels are guests in other channels.
- A node.js endpoint gets for each channel the top other channels based on how often they were guests at that channel.
- For example, for channel ultimathuman the top guest might be daveasprey with 5 visits.
- Based on the channels that are in preferences, the system calculates across all of them which other channels have the most guest visits.
- It finds the 3 channels with the most guest visits on any of the preference channels.
- Guest visits are calculated across all favorite channels, so if daveasprey has 1 visit on preference channel 1 and 3 visits on preference channel 2, then overall he gets a score of 4 visits.
- Only channels which are currently not in preferences are shown.
- Based on the overall score, the node.js endpoint executes a query to find the top 3 channels.
- Then in the cockpit a section called channel recommendations displays these 3 recommended channels.
