feature request:
- Users can ask questions or provide prompts in the Ask tab.
- The system automatically enhances the prompt by appending instructions to only consider information from the user's favorite YouTube channels.
- The enhanced prompt is sent to the FastAPI backend, which processes it using OpenAI and returns the response.
- The response is displayed with HTML escaping for security.
- The UI includes a text input field for user prompts, a submit button, and a response display area with scrollable container.
- Loading states appear during processing and errors are displayed for failed requests.
- If favorite channels exist, the system appends instructions to only consider those channels.
- The FastAPI endpoint runs on port 3002 and uses the ask.py module with OpenAI integration.
