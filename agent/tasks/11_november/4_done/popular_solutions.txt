feature request:
I have solutions in the preference tab in the frontend.
Now in the cockpit add a new category "Popular Solutions".
It should show the 10 most popular solutions based on this query here:
SELECT solution, count(distinct video_id)
FROM v_video_solutions
WHERE value
group by solution 
order  by count(*) DESC;

Then each of the solutions should be clickable.
If i click on it it should deatails about this solution.
For that it can use this query here (using the clicked solution as an insert):
SELECT distinct channel_id, video_id, video_title, video_summary FROM v_video_combined
WHERE video_id In (SELECT video_id FROM v_video_solutions WHERE solution = 'Animal Based')

Give me different options how it can be resolved on the frontend side.
for example should it iopen an extra html url where the details are displayed.
Or a popup with details? 
Or other options?
