feature request:
- Users can choose PubMed settings in the preferences, such as only clinical trials or only studies after 2000.
- A new category called pubmed is added to the preferences tab where users can configure these settings.
- These preferences are then used as input into the context when using the ask feature.
- Users can set start and end dates which refer to the publish_date field in the database.
- Users can also select one or many publication types from all available options in the publication_types column.
- The backend provides endpoints that read from the pubmed_studies table to get the information needed for the UI.
- These preferences are stored in the same way as other user preferences.
- When doing prompts with ask, those settings are provided as context to filter the results.
