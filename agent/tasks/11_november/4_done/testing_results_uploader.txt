feature request:
In the frontend i want to have an interface where i can upload a document of testing results.
The teting results can come in various not structured formats.
They can be pdfs, csvs, pictures.
The content can be in english or in any other language.
The structure can be different.
But in general most of the time specific values can be extracted.

Create those features:
1) Integrate the agent into my fastapi. Add an endpoint "agent" like with the "ask" endpoint where i can use a text prompt.
2) In the frontend add a new tab "testing_results". There add a file upload mask with drag and drop or click.
3) When a file is uploaded it should be stored, next to other user data like preferences.
4) After upload the agent endpoint should be called to start the agent. It should give it the correct instructions in order to:

6) The result then should be inserted into the table defined in testing_results.sql
