feature requests:
now in the tab testing results below the uploader add a table which shows the data from 
the table: testing_results.
- We need to aslo write the date of the test into the database. Usually the test document has a date.
It should be be the value in the database. For that in the database we need one extra column "testing_date".
It should also be shown in the frontend.
- some tests are just "positive" or "negative" (e.g test for mutation.) without having an explicit value.
Add to the agent instructions that for such tests for positive the value 1 and for negative the value -1.
And same for reference. 
- Add to the table the option to sort by test_object column or by the new testing_date column
