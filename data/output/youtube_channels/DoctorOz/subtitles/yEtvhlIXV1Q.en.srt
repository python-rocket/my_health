1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,160
Hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, retinol. No,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,320
you're not in chemistry lab, but most

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,480
likely in the skin care aisle reading

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,519
ingredient labels. So, what do these

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,599
ingredients do? And why do

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,440
dermatologists swear by them? And can

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,359
they help you with your aging skin,

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,359
giving exactly what it needs in those

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
skincare products? Dr. Rothia Rivera,

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,720
who's here on behalf of my trusted

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,199
sponsor partner, L'Oreal Parish, is here

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,320
to tell us more. Why do dermatologists

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,480
love these ingredients? Why do the

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,040
experts like you swear by them? Well,

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,000
hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, and retinol

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,079
are three of the top most effective and

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,079
derm proven ingredients, doctors. But

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,760
even me as a scientist, I get confused

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,360
in the skincare aisle. So, why don't we

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,360
do something? Why don't we rename them

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,000
for what dermatologist use them for? All

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,480
right. Hyaluronic acid to plump, vitamin

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
C to brighten, and retinol to reduce

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,120
wrinkles. That's all you need to know.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,480
All right. Then you're going to drive it

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,360
home with a couple demonstrations. We're

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,120
going to walk you through all three of

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
these ingredients very specifically.

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,120
We'll start with hyaluronic acid, which

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,199
is incredibly powerful when you use it

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,960
correctly. Yes. So, I butcher a little

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,640
skin demo here. Think of your skin

33
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,840
cells, not the ones that make this

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,000
beautiful skin, but the ones that may

35
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
give rise to wrinkly skin. And they sort

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,400
of do this to you. You see, they they're

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,040
small, they dry, they flake, they don't

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
give you the the shine, the the beauty

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,960
that you want. That's correct. These are

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,200
the dry cells are under our skin, but

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,119
hyaluronic acid actually, Dr. Ross,

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,080
plumps the skin from within. And exactly

43
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,680
and uh what you can see here is you know

44
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,280
hyaluronic acid Dr. because it's a

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,079
naturally occurring molecule in our

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,799
bodies, right? But as we age, we lose it

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,119
and that's a very a has a a very aging

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,119
effect on our skin. So if this is

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,439
hyaluronic acid plumped cells compared

50
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,680
to what I just did, watch that happens

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,079
when you use products with hyaluronic

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,640
acid, the skin regains that, you know,

53
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,000
plump youthful look that we all want and

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
they bounce. I mean, take a look at

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
that. This is before and this is after

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,799
with hyaluronic acid. Quite a change,

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,799
huh? plumping, hydrating

58
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,000
just right from, you know, underneath.

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,799
And so what do you do? How do you apply

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,119
it? Well, you know, at L'Oreal Paris, we

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,720
developed the uh Revital Derm

62
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,080
Intensives. Just use my hand. I see you

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,920
when you're doing it. She wants to rub

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,319
my hand. I want the plump ones with

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,040
hyaluronic acid. We have the Revital

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,920
Derm Intensives ampules. Dr. Ross, these

67
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,560
have our highest concentration of pure

68
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,000
hyaluronic acid. They've been validated

69
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,520
by dermatologist to intensely plump the

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,840
skin in just seven days. May I just tell

71
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,920
you, don't be fooled by the size. Small

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,760
but powerful, huh? Is it? Yes. The

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,760
little ampiel. Show me how to use them.

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,440
I'm going to show you. Here's what we

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,120
do. You tap from the top. You crack from

76
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,920
the top like that. And here's a little

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,200
trick. You use the top and you close it

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,519
and use it at night. You can use it

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,879
twice a day. 7-day treatment. It's

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,480
clever. It's smart. Is that fantastic?

81
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,959
So twice a day, seven days. Twice a day,

82
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,120
seven days for that intense plumping.

83
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
And this is exactly what your cells I

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,840
like it. All right. Plant plumping is

85
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,360
the first thing you said for hyaluronic

86
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,440
acid. For vitamin C, you said it was

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,599
about brightness. Yes. Dealing with the

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
aging skin. Now you have two examples

89
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
here. Two, let's say two different

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,680
people. They both have equal aging skins

91
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,680
that have lost that brightness that we

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
crave when we want to look youthful.

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
That's right. So vitamin C brightens the

94
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,760
skin. Like you said, Dr. Ros, it is a

95
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,239
very powerful antioxidant. As you know,

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,879
it's a dorm must have. So, let's take a

97
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,519
look at this. Let's imagine this water

98
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,840
represents your uneven dull skin. Like

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,720
you said, two of them. So, what happens

100
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,840
when we uh add um vitamin C, a product

101
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,840
with vitamin C? Research shows that it

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,159
actually not only works on future signs

103
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,159
of aging because you know this skin, Dr.

104
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,360
For us, this is exactly what happens

105
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,400
when we are exposed every day to sun,

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,239
pollution, dirt. This is what happens.

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,239
It ages our skin. It becomes dull

108
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,959
uneven. So, you apply the cream like you

109
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,159
just did. Let's apply, you know, a

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,040
vitamin C skinare product. All right.

111
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,200
And and look what happens.

112
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,879
Look at the before and after. Isn't that

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,640
the best? It's the best demo you've ever

114
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
done on the show. I know. Well, we like

115
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
to bring you the best. Bring me the best

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
for you. But look at that brightness

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,919
back. Brightness. And again, this is

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,759
vitamin C taken primarily topically.

119
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,600
Topically. Research shows that when you

120
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,400
apply a product with vitamin C, Dr.

121
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Ross, it is not only a very powerful

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,360
antioxidant, you know, it prevents

123
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,280
aging. Super important. Like with SPF,

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,960
but it also works on those signs of

125
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,400
aging that you already have. Yeah. You

126
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,840
you don't want to be this. You want to

127
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
be this. Yes. We want to work on that

128
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,680
uneven skin tone, the dullness that you

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,000
all we all have from the sun, the

130
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
pollution, the dirt. Retinol is the

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,199
third of the ingredients. The retinol I

132
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,800
keep hearing about from dermatologists

133
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,240
because it is powerful in so many ways.

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,960
But you going to demonstrate what it

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,080
does. Well, retinol, Dr. Os reduces

136
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,800
wrinkles. It is the most researched and

137
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,639
proven molecule that we have. Nothing

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
bits it. And let me just show you what

139
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,080
it does. This is our skin, right? It's

140
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
wrinkle. We have the fine lines, the

141
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,039
wrinkles. When you use products with

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,800
retinol, it smooths out the wrinkles.

143
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,560
Simply like that. No more complicated

144
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
than that. Smooths it out. Just be

145
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
consistent and this is what happens with

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,080
your wrinkles. So you got three powerful

147
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
products at once. How do you combine

148
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,600
them so people can actually make the

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,440
most out of it? You've formulated a new

150
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
product that you told me has all three

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,000
ingredients at once. Yes. So the L'Oreal

152
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,880
Revital Triple Power Moisturizer. It

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
doesn't have one but three of the top

154
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,280
dermatologist recommended ingredients

155
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,120
that we just saw. Hyaluronic acid,

156
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,520
vitamin C, and prinol. So plump,

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,440
brighten, and reduce wrinkles. Because

158
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,080
Dr. Rush, you should not settle for a

159
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,320
moisturizer that just hydrates. This is

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,600
why we call it triple power. Three

161
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,520
ingredients, three benefits, one week.

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,680
Yeah. And it's a moisturizer. It is a

163
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,759
fantastic moisturizer. It has terrific

164
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,080
texture. This is This one is actually on

165
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,680
fragrance. Um it's a beautiful,

166
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,280
beautiful texture. Very easy to use

167
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,880
morning and night. One of the beautiful

168
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,919
things about talking about skincare is

169
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,680
you actually have people who've tried

170
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,199
it. So, one of my viewers, Tracy, has

171
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
been using the Revital Lift Hyaluronic

172
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,199
Acid Ampules and the Revital Lift Triple

173
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,720
Power Moisturizer for five weeks. Is

174
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,240
that right? Yes. So, what was your skin

175
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,919
like before you started on this little

176
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,720
escapade?

177
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,319
To me, it looked very dull. It looked

178
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,639
lifeless. It was dry. I just was

179
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,479
embarrassed to even take pictures close

180
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,199
up. I saw a lot of lines in my lip and

181
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,560
on my smile. Even before you took this

182
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,000
product, I'm sure that you were worth

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,199
taking pictures of. I don't want you

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,039
ever thinking that no matter what.

185
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,479
Always. All right. So, you went on the

186
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,600
on the experiment for five weeks. How

187
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,560
did it turn out? I love the results. I

188
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,199
feel like my skin is smooth. I can feel

189
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,240
smoothness. I think it looks smooth. It

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,400
looks fresh. It looks plump. I noticed

191
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,039
that a lot of my lines have um

192
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,280
disappeared. I am just thrilled with the

193
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,759
results. Um, I went to the hairdresser

194
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,759
this week and she actually said

195
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,520
something to me without knowing I was

196
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,280
taking a pro or doing a product. That's

197
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,960
great. We love that. And she said, "Your

198
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,199
skin looks so much younger and

199
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,759
healthier." So, I was like, "Well,

200
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,080
actually," and I told her that I've been

201
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,000
using the products. Um, I have told some

202
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,680
of my friends, they're excited to start

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,479
beginning to use the products. I

204
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,360
absolutely love it. I traveled. It was

205
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,440
um very little to take along, right? Um,

206
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,759
it was wonderful. A little but powerful,

207
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,160
huh? Yep. As predicted. Barthia, you you

208
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,520
become an influencer. Yes. Yes. People

209
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,759
are going to be jealous of you soon.

210
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you. Her skin, how radiant, how

211
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,360
smooth, you know, it just it, you know,

212
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,639
I'm very excited. Beautiful before,

213
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,319
beautiful after. What's the best way to

214
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,479
apply the system? Well, you use it like

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,000
she said, you use it uh the ampule and

216
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
then you follow with the triple power

217
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,319
moisturizer and visible results in one

218
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
week. Morning, morning and evening.

219
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,080
Morning and evening. Yes. And you know,

220
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,199
use that trick. You use the top um if

221
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,039
you want to use Where do you find it?

222
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,520
What does it cost? You can find both of

223
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,840
these products at Walmart for just under

224
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,240
$20 each. Wow, that's wonderful. Isn't

225
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,280
that fantastic? Yes. You know what makes

226
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,960
it sustainable? God bless you for

227
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
