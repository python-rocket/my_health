1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,520
What were the last words he said? When

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,800
life comes to an end as we are dying,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,440
the brain experiences a burst of energy.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,920
Often final words are spoken. My father

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,240
looked down at my son and said, "I

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,160
promise, buddy." But what do they really

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,160
mean? He was trying to say to him, "I

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,320
promise I'm going to be with you." We

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,320
investigate the science behind final

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,700
words. We are aware of what we're

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,920
saying. Coming up next.

[Music]

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,520
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,320
[Music]

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,460
I love you back.

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,460
[Music]

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,330
[Applause]

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,320
In those last moments before a loved one

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,480
dies, there are so many emotions and

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,039
questions. Today, we unravel the most

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,280
mystifying question of all. What do the

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,520
final words uttered before someone dies

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
really mean? For the first time ever,

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,439
we're investigating the science about

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,920
what's going on in the brain as death

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,080
nears and piece together the meaning of

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,560
final words with the insights of an

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,720
intuitive grief counselor who says she

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,960
can help uncover what your loved ones

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,720
want you to know today. What insights

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,720
can you learn from last

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,040
words? The final words of the dying can

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,320
often be a mystery. These last thoughts

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,320
can offer comfort or even

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,119
advice. Bob Marley imparted a poant

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,759
message in his last moments. Money can't

37
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,560
buy life. While some final words

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,320
revealed the weight of tragedy and

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,119
shock, Princess Diana's reported final

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,119
words were, "My God, what's happened?"

41
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,159
before going into cardiac arrest that

42
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,079
fateful night in Paris. Many have tried

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,920
to analyze the last words of tech

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,040
visionary Steve Jobs. He said, "Oh wow.

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,640
Oh wow. Oh

46
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,560
wow. Viewers from across the country

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,280
have also been puzzled by the final

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,680
words of their loved ones. My mother

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,160
hung up the phone, sat back in her

50
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,000
chair, closed her eyes for a second,

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,080
said oh no, and then she was

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,640
gone. I always wondered what she saw or

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,040
who she saw. I lost my son when he was

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,120
18 years old, and his final message to

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,440
me was, "Don't ever leave a hat on the

56
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,760
bed." It's been 29 years, and I still

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,720
have no idea what that means. My

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,239
mother-in-law said before she passed,

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,360
Leonard, that's my father-in-law, and I

60
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,840
never really thought you would work. And

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,160
I'd like to know exactly what that

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,239
statement meant.

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,920
Brianna's here. She says her loved one

64
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
said something that still baffles her

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,440
today. So, you lost your dad 13 years

66
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,040
ago. Describe those last moments. um

67
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,120
those last moments with him

68
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:11,040
um because he was dying of cancer, he

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,360
would think that other people was his

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,040
family members and we knew that that was

71
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,000
coming towards the end. What were the

72
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:25,200
last words he said to my son?

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,440
Um my son was helping my mom and he was

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,159
helping my mom with my dad to use the

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,599
bathroom. Mhm. And my dad stood up with

76
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,360
my mom and my son. They both were

77
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,040
holding him. And my son told my mom to

78
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,799
be

79
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:44,400
gentle. Just just wait a minute. And my

80
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:48,000
father looked down at my son and said,

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,239
"I promise, buddy. I promise. I promise,

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,560
buddy."

83
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,319
And that was it. That was it. What does

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
that mean? What? Have you piece that

85
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,400
together? What? No. And that's what we

86
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,920
want to know. And what overall questions

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,519
do you have about his passing? What

88
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,319
questions do you think your dad could

89
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,680
help you with right now? I just want to

90
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,280
know honestly if he sees the man that my

91
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,360
son is. Um I was 15 when I had my son.

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,639
Um after I had him, my dad actually

93
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,120
pulled me aside and told me that because

94
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,880
of my

95
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,560
son, that's what stopped him from taking

96
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,040
his life. He credits your son with that

97
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
with saving him. Yes.

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,639
Okay. Yes. Let me bring in two experts

99
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,639
who might have some answers because I

100
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,800
hear these a lot in medicine. There are

101
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,160
last words. Usually there's family there

102
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
to hear them. Anna Ramandi is here.

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,320
She's an intuitive grief counselor and

104
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
medium. Erica Goldblad. I who researched

105
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,120
the field of death for more than a

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,440
decade. Thank you both for being here.

107
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,280
So Erica, what are the the most recent

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,880
studies tell us about the kinds of

109
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,400
things people say at the end of their

110
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,400
lives? What are the three most common

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,720
things people mention before death?

112
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,199
Sure. Well, there was a recent survey

113
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
that asked people what the final words

114
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,040
uh that they heard from their loved ones

115
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,520
were. And interestingly enough, uh most

116
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,120
people were given advice of some kind.

117
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,360
In particular, they were given

118
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
relationship advice. And then the next

119
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
category down was about careers. But

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,639
what's also really fascinating is there

121
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,560
have been other studies that have

122
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,199
explored what the meaning of final words

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,199
could be. And what's been noticed is

124
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,840
there are a variety of categories that

125
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,240
people repeatedly fall into. So for

126
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,960
example, frequently people talk about

127
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,280
taking a trip somewhere or as we saw

128
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,759
with Steve Jobs, they may repeat the

129
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,759
same word over and over and over again.

130
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,919
So ultimately we're still trying to

131
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,960
figure out what's happening and I really

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,880
tell my patients that uh the meaning of

133
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,039
final words is going to be up to the

134
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,120
people in the room uh left to decipher

135
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,520
them. Does the person who's giving the

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,680
final words have the awareness? Are they

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,680
really aware of what's happening around

138
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,680
them? clears their mind. What's

139
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
happening biologically? Well, as you

140
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,000
know, death is defined as the moment

141
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,080
that the heart stops beating, right? So,

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,160
there's no longer any blood flowing to

143
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,479
the brain. That's how we define the time

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,199
of death. What's so fascinating though

145
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,560
is that as we are dying, it appears that

146
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,560
the brain experiences a burst of energy.

147
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,039
So, we're trying to say something. Maybe

148
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,639
our tongues feel heavy or our jaws feel

149
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,720
tight and the words aren't coming out

150
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,360
right, but we are aware of what we're

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,560
saying. Anna, take us to a deeper level

152
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,199
here. It's not just the words. There are

153
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,280
other non-verbal cues that people can

154
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,479
give as they're dying. Yeah, sometimes

155
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,240
they point um they either point up,

156
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,479
sideways, down, or to other people in

157
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,720
the room to try to convey information.

158
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,120
Um looking into their eyes, you know,

159
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,800
their eyes speak. Um so if you look into

160
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,479
someone who's passing's eyes, you'll be

161
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,680
able to see what's really going on

162
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,080
within them as well. So let me ask you

163
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,000
if you can give some support here. What

164
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,919
what do you make out of the final words

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,440
that we're talking about and other clues

166
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,919
that might be evident and particularly

167
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,680
the issue about your son and what your

168
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,919
father is seeing in your son? Well,

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,599
first of all, your father had a very

170
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,360
deep connection to your son on a soul

171
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,440
level. He wanted your son to know that

172
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,199
he was not being abandoned. So, I feel

173
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
like there was abandonment before that

174
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,720
and your father came in and that he was

175
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,479
always going to be around your son

176
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,400
because your son was suffering and

177
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,319
grieving before it happened. He was

178
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
trying to ease the grief. He was trying

179
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,840
to say to him, "I promise I'm going to

180
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,080
be with you because I think a lot of

181
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,720
that was going on at the time in your

182
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,039
son's in your son's head." He absolutely

183
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,440
sees what a great guy your son is and

184
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,520
he's very proud of you. Okay? So, you

185
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,319
should know that as well. It's not just

186
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,080
your son, it's you, too. Was there

187
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,240
tension when your son was born when you

188
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,120
were only 15?

189
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,560
There was some tension. Um, it was

190
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,680
unexpected. I didn't know I was pregnant

191
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,840
until I went into labor. Oh my goodness.

192
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,919
Yeah.

193
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,160
Well, it's a good last bit of advice to

194
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,280
give then by your father. Yeah, that

195
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,280
would have been an important moment in

196
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,840
his life. How does it make you feel to

197
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,000
hear that interpretation from Anna? Um,

198
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,319
it makes me feel good. It make it it

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,080
answers what I wanted to know. It does

200
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,319
answer what I wanted to know. Brought me

201
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,000
some closure. All right. Up next, what

202
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,360
do people see or hear when they're close

203
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,759
to death? And what can your loved ones

204
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,000
last words reveal about the other side?

205
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,000
Stay around.

206
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,880
Giant fibroids. This was about 70 lb.

207
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,519
Painful fibroids. It can crush organs.

208
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,200
Can hair care products be the cause? Has

209
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,719
there been a link identified between any

210
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,880
of these compounds and these these

211
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,880
reproductive organ issues? So many women

212
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,519
suffer in silence. It has hurt the

213
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,480
intimacy. Absolutely. We investigate

214
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,600
fibroids. And just

215
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,640
listen, it's pretty heavy. All new Oz.

216
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,640
That's coming up on

217
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:00,399
[Music]

218
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,720
Monday. We're back investigating the

219
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,160
final words said before death. What

220
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,120
could they really mean? Grief counselor

221
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,880
and medium Anandi is back. And you say

222
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,800
sometimes the last words that a person

223
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,959
utters here is actually what they're

224
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,600
seeing when they've crossed over. Oh,

225
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,839
absolutely. Because as they're dying,

226
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,440
they're in two different places. So

227
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,600
they're in this dimension and they're

228
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,200
halfway into that dimension. So some of

229
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
the things they're saying have nothing

230
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
to do with what's going on right here.

231
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,080
It gives it a bit more power. We could

232
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
be getting a glimpse into the other

233
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,920
world from Oh, absolutely. these words,

234
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,279
these insights. Absolutely. And one of

235
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
the members of our audience, Emory,

236
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,320
let's go meet her, says that her father

237
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,880
whispered these final words to her. What

238
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
is that noise? That's what she said.

239
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,920
That's why I was thinking about this

240
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,959
issue of what he was potentially seeing.

241
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,600
Emry, how are you? So, what what was

242
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,320
going on that day? What the room was

243
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,320
virtually silent, I am told.

244
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,360
He had come back from his evening walk

245
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,120
with my mom and he was calm and then all

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,880
of a sudden he just kept saying, "What

247
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,080
is that noise?" And I didn't hear

248
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,240
anything and he kept saying it and

249
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,240
saying it and saying it and I said, "Are

250
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,680
you in any pain?" And he's like, "No,

251
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm fine." He'd go to the window, he'd

252
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,959
look up and he'd say, "What is that

253
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,640
noise?" And he just kept repeating it.

254
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,079
And then I I got a little nervous so I

255
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
said, "Do you want me to call an

256
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,760
ambulance or something?" He said, "No."

257
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,440
He said, "Wait, we need to pay some

258
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,360
bills." I'm like, "Okay." So, we paid

259
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,200
all the bills and then he said, "And we

260
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,720
need to pray." I said, "Okay." So, we

261
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
just kind of sat there and prayed

262
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,240
together and he said, "But I just wish I

263
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,920
knew what that noise was." And you can't

264
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,000
hear this noise. I hear nothing. And

265
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,640
it's odd because he was really deaf for

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,480
the last 40 years of his life. And then,

267
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,440
um, when we finished praying, he said to

268
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,160
me, "Call." So, I said, "Okay, I'll

269
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,480
call." And no sooner had I hung up the

270
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,279
phone with the

271
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,959
paramedics, he collapsed. and all of my

272
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,120
uh first aid and CPR training that went

273
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,279
out the window and I'm shaking him and I

274
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,560
just kind of looked at him and I picked

275
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,720
him up and I'm screaming, "Daddy,

276
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,160
daddy." And he was, you know, you can

277
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,920
tell when a person's gone. And he smiled

278
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,160
and it was the first time he'd smiled in

279
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,040
about a year cuz he had not been well.

280
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,200
And it just while I was extremely

281
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,279
emotional and very sad and angry and

282
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,680
scared, I was also filled with peace

283
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,959
because I saw that smile that I missed.

284
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,560
I know. How would you interpret those

285
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,600
final words? First of all, he heard

286
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,839
symbols. I know that sounds crazy, but

287
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,480
symbols. He heard symbols being played.

288
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,200
It got his attention. Okay. It was them

289
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,800
saying, "Get ready. Get ready." So, on a

290
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,760
soul level, his soul was getting ready

291
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,600
to go. But also on a conscious level, he

292
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,800
told you, "Here, I'm going to go." And

293
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,200
he saw when he passed. Um, there was a

294
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,959
woman waiting for him. Um, your mother

295
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,399
passed before he did. No, she's still

296
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,399
there was a woman. Then that was his own

297
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,000
mother. She was waiting for him and

298
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,920
there was a party and I feel there was

299
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,760
music and drums. There was a lot of

300
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,240
music around him. He was never the same

301
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,920
when she passed. So yeah. And so that's

302
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
what you know she was providing this

303
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,680
great big party for him. It's a very

304
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,920
beautiful story. You should you should

305
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,160
be very happy about that. I was once I

306
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,160
saw that smile. It was the comfort I

307
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,480
needed to get through, you know, well

308
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,880
today. So So what do Anarie's loved ones

309
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,320
want her to know? Well, first of all,

310
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,160
your father wants to know that there's a

311
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,440
party on the other side. Okay. Okay. I'm

312
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,200
sure there is. And they're having a

313
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,279
grand old time, but they're also around

314
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,920
you. And you followed his wishes down to

315
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,320
the tea. Um, and he's thanking you. Um,

316
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,680
and he's very much around your mother.

317
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,440
Okay. So, I don't know what's going on

318
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,839
with your mother, but he's around her

319
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,920
completely. Thank you. You're welcome.

320
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,920
For for many folks listening right now

321
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,079
who who are trying to make sense of the

322
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,680
last words of their loved ones, what

323
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,880
what do you what's the overarching

324
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,480
lesson there? What do you What do their

325
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,320
loved ones want them to know about

326
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
what's going on? I think the most

327
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
important thing they want everyone to

328
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,600
know is that a they're okay. They're

329
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,760
going to a good place and that they're

330
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,920
never going to leave us. Truly, love

331
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,320
never dies. It's always around us.

332
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,800
They're not, you know, a million billion

333
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,120
miles away. They're right here and they

334
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,360
want us to communicate with them.

335
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,170
Thanks, Emry. Thank you. As always,

336
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,000
wonderful insights. We'll be right back.

337
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,560
[Music]

338
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,639
A real life fatal attraction. She was on

339
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,120
this obsessive path focused solely on

340
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,360
Dave. Could the accused stalker be just

341
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,480
another victim? 911. What's your

342
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,610
emergency? I've been shot. All new Oz.

343
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,839
That's coming up on

344
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:30,160
[Music]

345
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,399
Tuesday. Today, are you being tricked by

346
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,000
fake reviews on the internet? Have you

347
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,160
ever bought a product based on a

348
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,839
positive review? Probably yes. Right.

349
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,000
Right. How do you know it's real?

350
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,760
When you want to shed the pounds, the

351
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,320
only thing more tempting than a piece of

352
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,720
cheesecake is the desire to type a bunch

353
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,600
of diet plans into a search engine and

354
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,720
see what works. But your search may pull

355
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,720
up a website that looks like this. At

356
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,399
first glance, it seems like a review

357
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,279
website like you might see for

358
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,279
restaurants or hotels. It even has star

359
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,160
ratings offering opinions of the

360
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,040
different diet plans out there. However,

361
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,760
if you read closely, it becomes clear

362
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,000
they may not be independently offering

363
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,320
unbiased subscriptions of the diets

364
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,240
you're interested

365
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,360
in. And if you click on some enticing

366
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,680
image, it may bring you to another page

367
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,519
with a special offer you can't

368
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,160
resist. Today, we're investigating these

369
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,580
fake review sites that could be luring

370
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,199
you into buying questionable products.

[Music]

372
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,040
Last year, a company called Golo filed a

373
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,120
lawsuit against this show, claiming we

374
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,440
and other media outlets were duped by

375
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,440
these fake online reviews. But now, we

376
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,680
are joining forces to expose the

377
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,639
problem. I'm joined now by Dr. Jeffrey

378
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,320
Cudson, a spokesperson for Golo. He is

379
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,480
here because he is passionate about

380
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
informing the public about this threat.

381
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,040
Why is it so important to you, Dr.

382
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,240
Catson? It's very straightforward, Dr.

383
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,000
Oz. It's um scamming and it's um

384
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,160
dishonest. And for the most part, when

385
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,839
you talk about the diet industry, you

386
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,440
have a group of people who are very

387
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,720
vulnerable. They're out there searching

388
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
for something. They're looking for a

389
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,240
better lifestyle or they're looking to

390
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,160
lose weight and they're being led away

391
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,639
from something that might really help

392
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,160
them going towards something that

393
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,360
someone is just trying to make money.

394
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,600
So, here's the deal, everybody. you see

395
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,720
a negative review of a product on one of

396
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,120
these fake sites with a onestar rating,

397
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,800
should we be able to identify? Should we

398
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,560
believe them? And that's an issue that I

399
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,120
think has got all of us fumbling because

400
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,040
I want to trust those sites. We all want

401
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,680
to trust those sites. But in the diet

402
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,760
industry, there is no site out there

403
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,120
that's going to be doing reviews. If you

404
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,680
see somebody who's saying they're

405
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,360
reviewing something, it's a scam right

406
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,279
there and then you know that you're

407
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,880
being tricked into doing something that

408
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,040
you weren't intending to do. But there

409
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,199
are some big review companies, right,

410
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,160
the Consumer Reports or Consumer Labs

411
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,639
that sort of do this stuff

412
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,639
professionally. Yes, indeed they do. But

413
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,639
not in the diet industry. There's nobody

414
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,720
out there. You can almost be assured

415
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,959
that if you see something that says it's

416
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,800
a they're reviewing something, it's just

417
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,720
not true. They're looking to lure you

418
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,759
away from a product. So everyone just

419
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,360
put down what you're doing right now and

420
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
listen for a second. You know how

421
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,560
constantly angered I am by scams on the

422
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,480
internet. You guys have all been

423
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,920
targeted. I've been targeted myself of

424
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,079
my image being stolen to promote

425
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,519
products I do not endorse. And it's

426
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,880
almost impossible to stop these things

427
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,480
down, right? No one's doing anything

428
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,720
about it. So it's up to you to be

429
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,480
informed. Now I had no idea, Dr. Cson,

430
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,240
that there were so many fake reviews out

431
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,000
there. But now that I appreciate it, I

432
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,160
get it completely and you will as well.

433
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,680
So Dr. Cson has some red flags to look

434
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,360
out for that I want you all to pay

435
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,880
attention to. We've created a fake

436
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,800
review site. We went through the trouble

437
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,639
of making a fake review about a plan

438
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,720
that doesn't exist. We're going to call

439
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,959
it the thinned down diet. Does that

440
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,880
sound good to you guys? All right. It's

441
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,480
fake. I made it up. We even bought the

442
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
URL because they knew scammers would

443
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,480
watch the show and immediately start

444
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,240
creating fake, you know, the thin diet

445
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,160
versions to take advantage of you. So,

446
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,440
we're trying to protect you. But once we

447
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,559
Google a diet, once you're in there

448
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,079
clicking away, right? You're on your

449
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,559
server and you write down the thin down

450
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,640
diet, right? more websites than just the

451
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,799
homepage of this company come up. For

452
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,919
example, right, this one down here says,

453
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,079
"Is the Thin Down Diet legit or scam?"

454
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,120
You see that down here? Right. Would you

455
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,919
click on that if you're interested in

456
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,360
the Thin Down Diet? Right. I would click

457
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,679
on that. So, what's the first way to

458
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,559
know that this might be a fake review?

459
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,400
Well, is the whole just the article. I

460
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,600
mean, come on. This is showbiz. Is a

461
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,320
Thin Down Diet legit or is it a scam?

462
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,400
That alone tells you that they're trying

463
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,080
to scam you. They're trying to move you

464
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
away from what you probably were trying

465
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,440
to look at and get you to look at this

466
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,919
diet. All right. So, just from the title

467
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,240
alone, you got a red flag. Normally,

468
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,400
this is a little too, as you mentioned,

469
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,480
show busy. Something's going down here.

470
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,919
Right. The next way to f to spot a fake

471
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,880
review if the title doesn't turn you on

472
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,960
to it is that the author didn't buy or

473
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,559
test the product. Look at this. Right.

474
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,200
This is you click down on that little

475
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,400
fake title and do you see anywhere here

476
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,960
that it says they tested this, right?

477
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,960
It's clear they they may or may not have

478
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,320
tested it, but if they had tested it,

479
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,480
they would have told you about it. They

480
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,320
would have uh put out their appropriate

481
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,760
statistics. So, they're not testing the

482
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,679
stuff. They're just throwing it out

483
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,520
there to catch your attention. That's

484
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,440
just a another way to pull you away from

485
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,200
what you're looking for and have you buy

486
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
a product that you never started looking

487
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,480
for. I just made just a common sense

488
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,480
test. If you did a lot of work to test

489
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,000
this product and put women on it for

490
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,400
weeks and weeks and weeks, wouldn't you

491
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,760
brag about it, right? You tell somebody

492
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,360
about it. They're not telling you

493
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,840
because they didn't do it. The next way

494
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,840
to spot a fake review is there are links

495
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,760
there for competing products. Let me

496
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,720
just for a second. So, you saw we went

497
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,160
we went to find the thin down diet. Now,

498
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,520
you're you're in the review. They're

499
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,360
telling you check out our top

500
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,960
recommendations for weight loss. How

501
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,880
does this work? Well, first of all, let

502
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,440
me say when they put something in like

503
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
um our top recommendations, that's just

504
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,880
being completely biased. They're taking

505
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,320
you away from what you're looking at,

506
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,160
they're taking you to what they're

507
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,679
probably getting paid to show you,

508
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,919
right? And actually, speaking of being

509
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,000
paid, they actually can put ads on the

510
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,960
site. And I'm curious if they've lied

511
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,840
about the rating and the testing, are

512
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,240
these ads legitimate as well? Same

513
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,160
situation. I mean, there's another way

514
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,080
of making money here. If you put an ad

515
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,640
up, every time someone clicks on that

516
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,400
ad, everyone's making money. You're

517
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,480
losing money, but they're making money.

518
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,520
So, what's being done to about these

519
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,679
fake diet review scams?

520
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,240
That's the saddest part of all. It's

521
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,840
nothing's being done. Legal system can't

522
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,240
handle it. It's too overwhelmingly

523
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,120
large. And who's the big loser here?

524
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,960
It's the consumer. So, the only way that

525
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,720
consumers can possibly figure this out

526
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,480
is they need to do their own homework.

527
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,160
They need to go towards sites that are

528
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,880
legitimate. They need to see that

529
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,200
there's clinical trials to prove what

530
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,000
they will accomplish for you, but this

531
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,640
stuff is just not the place to be. So, a

532
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,480
big message is no one's policing these

533
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,720
fake review sites. That means you got to

534
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,000
step up and protect yourself. So, take

535
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,360
advantage of the red flags we gave you.

536
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,960
Tell your friends about it. Let's stop

537
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,120
this down ourselves. We'll be right back

538
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,120
with more.

539
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,440
Giant fibroids. This was about 70 lb.

540
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,840
Painful fibroids. It can crush organs.

541
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,640
So many women suffer in silence. It has

542
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,340
hurt the intimacy. Absolutely. That's

543
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,559
coming up on

544
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,240
[Music]

545
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,159
Monday. There are so many weight loss

546
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,080
plans and sometimes hard to find what

547
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,919
works for you. We're back with Dr.

548
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,320
Jeffrey Cotney. is a spokesperson for

549
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,640
Golo who just revealed that there are

550
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,480
sites online that could be tricking you

551
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,640
with fake reviews on some of the most

552
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,960
popular diets. So, how do you tell? How

553
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,559
do you know which diet to choose? So,

554
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,880
what should folks be looking for as a

555
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,120
doctor in a diet or a meal plan? Well,

556
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,280
I'm glad you said as a doctor because

557
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,880
that's the truth. The truth is this is a

558
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,039
medical condition. This is a medical

559
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,679
issue. It may be weight loss, but weight

560
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,240
loss has everything to do tied in with

561
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,679
good health. And so as far as what they

562
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,919
you should look for, you should look for

563
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,600
something that works. I've spent 35

564
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,919
years in practice in obstetrics and

565
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,400
gynecology as you know. And I can tell

566
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,240
you what doesn't work. That's for sure.

567
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,320
Because I've been trying to find the

568
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,080
product that does work. and the products

569
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
that work are the ones that you've got

570
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,919
to get away from these review sites and

571
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,000
you've got to go to their site and you

572
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,320
have to see if they are looking at

573
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,640
clinical studies, studies that can prove

574
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,400
that their product, their process works,

575
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,000
their plan works, their supplements

576
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,679
work. So, you recently completed a

577
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,240
clinical trial, a a pretty important

578
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,880
one. What were the results? Results were

579
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,080
quite clear in in Golo, which is the

580
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,000
company that I've decided to support is

581
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,600
has done a study and we're so excited

582
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,440
about it. It was a clinical trial that

583
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,799
was done last year and it had two

584
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,960
groups. Both were on the go diet and one

585
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,080
group received a placebo. The other

586
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,679
group received release which is the

587
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,600
supplement. We're so excited about it

588
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,840
because the release group had a 79%

589
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,200
increase in weight loss over the placebo

590
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,360
group. So good that we're off to having

591
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,039
this submitted and reviewed for

592
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,320
publication in the near future. Right.

593
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,840
So go brought someone from their

594
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,400
clinical trial here today. Dawn lost 42

595
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,280
pounds on her plan. 42 pounds on the

596
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,080
gold plan. During the trial, she's gone

597
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,679
from a size 20 to a size eight. Now,

598
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,960
here's the part that I really care

599
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,280
about. Her triglycerides went from 247

600
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,320
to 107. And she also lowered her

601
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:48,000
cholesterol. Here's what she looked like

602
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,000
before. And here's what she looks like

603
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:52,400
today. And we get to meet Don. How are

604
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,600
you? I am great, thank you. Well, you

605
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,720
have a lot of energy in your eyes. How

606
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,600
do you feel? I feel fabulous. And since

607
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,520
the the clinical trial, I've lost 23

608
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,280
more pounds. I've lost 75

609
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,760
lbs. Went

610
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,400
from a year ago, I was in a size 20, now

611
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,280
I'm in a size eight and I feel fabulous.

612
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,880
I'm 66 years old.

613
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,320
Are you really? Yeah. Oh my goodness.

614
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,559
You have other other secrets then as

615
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,440
well. What did you like about the Golo

616
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,760
program? I could see that it was a very

617
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,880
nutritious plan. It was balanced. You

618
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,960
had fats. We eat olive oil and butter.

619
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,400
You have

620
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,400
carbohydrates. You eat a very balanced

621
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,799
and it's a lifestyle change. It's a

622
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,880
healthy lifestyle change. It's clean

623
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,960
foods. There's no preservatives in the

624
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,320
foods that you eat. So, I love that.

625
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,640
What was the biggest challenge being on

626
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,640
the diet? Well, I had a lot of bad

627
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,760
habits I had to break. like lots of

628
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,360
people, you go home, you know, you skip

629
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,600
breakfast, you eat fast food for lunch,

630
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,760
you go home and you graze all the way

631
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,679
until that salted caramel ice cream at

632
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,919
the end of the night, you know, and so I

633
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,320
had a lot of bad habits and I had a lot

634
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,400
of misconceptions. I thought skim milk

635
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,559
was good for you, you know. I thought

636
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,919
that canola oil was good for you. There

637
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,159
were all these things that have

638
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,799
additives and I've learned to eat very

639
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,559
pure, which is great. The the problem

640
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,159
with a lot of diet plans is when you go

641
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,720
off them. Yes, because they were

642
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,159
ownorous or hard to do. You've sort of

643
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,000
slipped back. But you say you've gone

644
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,480
the opposite direction as you mentioned.

645
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,320
I keep losing weight because I'm going

646
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,000
to eat this way for the rest of my life.

647
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,720
And I think one of the things that you

648
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,480
talk about is it's a healthy lifestyle.

649
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,559
And I love it. I love going through the

650
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,559
grocery line and everybody seeing all

651
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,480
the healthy foods that I eat. Everybody

652
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,320
comes up to me and goes, "How did you do

653
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,880
that?" And I'm going to eat this way for

654
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,200
the rest of my life. My mom is 92. I

655
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,720
want to go out dancing. I got a lot of

656
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,320
years left. I think you're coming at

657
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,480
her. So, what are the main components of

658
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,679
the plan, Dr. Cassin? As Dawn has

659
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,640
already told you, and we've spoken

660
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,799
before, she's joyful. She loves this

661
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,279
diet and it's not just a diet for her.

662
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,840
It's a new way of life. And what this

663
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,559
program is all about is making it easy

664
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,960
to sustain weight loss because it's the

665
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,960
slow loss of weight over a sustained

666
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,159
period of time. She can go out with her

667
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
friends. She can go out to dinner with

668
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,320
her family. She can eat the same food as

669
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,880
her family. We're not asking people to

670
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,120
get rid of one major food group, not to

671
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,520
get rid of carbohydrates and be high on

672
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,880
proteins. Eat like you should eat with

673
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,720
all the food groups, including

674
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,400
vegetables, including carbohydrates,

675
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,120
fats, and and um and protein, and be

676
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,919
able to enjoy your meals. Who wants to

677
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,039
go start not enjoying eating? Loneliness

678
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,559
becomes the biggest problem with a lot

679
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,840
of plants. Come over here. Show what

680
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,559
you've concocted for us. This is a

681
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,440
typical day. So, this is a typical day

682
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,600
of what I eat. and I eat all this food.

683
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,840
What's great is that I take the release

684
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,000
and I'm not hungry in between. That's

685
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,640
how when I was on the clinical trial, I

686
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,720
knew that I was on release. But one of

687
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,600
the things that we love is super fuel

688
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,440
and it's a mix of

689
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,440
carbohydrates. It's proteins. I saute

690
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,919
them in a little olive oil with a lot of

691
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,720
fresh vegetables and I just love it.

692
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,360
It's healthy for you and it's just fun.

693
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,200
Look at all this food, guys. I lost 75

694
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,360
pounds eating all this food every single

695
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,400
day. You ever put hot sauce on this? Oh,

696
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,480
yes, I do. I like it a little spicy.

697
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,640
Good. I can tell. All right. I'm very

698
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,400
proud of you. I really am. Keep it up.

699
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,799
Keep spreading the wisdom. Thank you for

700
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,240
all you do. God bless you, Dr. Kas.

701
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,370
Thanks very much. All right. We'll be

702
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,559
right back.

703
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,320
[Applause]

704
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,320
I love getting to talk with you on my

706
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,880
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

707
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,880
is not over. I still have a lot that I

708
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,679
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,279
all of you could be hiding behind these

715
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,279
closed doors when no one else is

716
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,440
watching. What are you really doing in

717
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,200
here? Could it be helpful or harmful to

718
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,640
your health? I want to get to my first

719
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,210
confession, but you'll just have to

720
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,480
excuse me for just a moment.

721
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,520
[Music]

722
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,120
Hey, Dr. Oz. I am a busy mom. Between

723
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,520
taking care of my kids and taking care

724
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,679
of my house, my life is absolutely crazy

725
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,159
and frantic. And you know what?

726
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,559
Sometimes I just want a little me time.

727
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,880
And I like to indulge. And as funny as

728
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,799
it is, I come in my bathroom cuz I can

729
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
finally get some peace and quiet.

730
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,960
Inevitably, while I'm in here, I have a

731
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,720
snack attack. So, I always bring in some

732
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,600
kind of snacks with me, like

733
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,960
blueberries, cuz you know, I'm trying to

734
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,480
be healthy. Sometimes I even like to

735
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,520
really indulge and have cake. I brought

736
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,559
this in with me, too. Dr. Oz, I have to

737
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,360
confess, I am a multitasker. I like to

738
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,240
eat and sit on my toilet all at the same

739
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,000
time.

740
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,240
Rebecca the multitasker joins me now.

741
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,679
Blueberries. Really? I I know. I I

742
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,520
usually do eat the cake. I was trying to

743
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,880
be good. No one let you show off that.

744
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,039
What kind of foods do you normally eat?

745
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,840
Seriously. Um seriously, I'll have

746
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,679
granola bars, maybe chips. Oh, the stuff

747
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,240
in front of me here. Muffins. How did it

748
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,440
all start? Cookies. It's unbelievable. I

749
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,520
I just feel like I finally get quiet

750
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,760
time when I'm in the bathroom. And the

751
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,159
minute you yell out I'm in the bathroom,

752
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,600
people are silent. So, I I do have some

753
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,279
concerns about germs, which I will get

754
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,960
to later in the show. But there's

755
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,640
another surprising risk to stack on the

756
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,240
toilet that I'm going to share with you.

757
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,320
When you bring a snack into the toilet,

758
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,080
what do you do? You tend to sort of sit

759
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,840
there for a little while, right? Rush

760
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,440
through your bagel or your muffin or

761
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,039
whatever. Sitting on the toilet for

762
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,919
prolonged periods of time may increase

763
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,679
the pressure on the veins down below

764
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,360
like where you go potty and everything

765
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,919
that causes hemorrhoids. And

766
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,200
hemorrhoids, you don't want to have

767
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,799
them. It's not worth the bagels, the

768
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,640
muffins, and everything else. How might

769
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,480
this potential concern change your

770
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,159
snacking habits in the toilet? Well, you

771
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,080
might think it's kind of funny, but I

772
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,399
don't want to leave my quiet bathroom

773
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,559
where I'm have time to myself. So, maybe

774
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,600
I'll just stand up. That's good. Don't

775
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,200
tell them. They don't They don't know if

776
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,200
you're sitting or not, right? I know.

777
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,120
Thank you, Rebecca. All right. The next

778
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,720
confession is actually one of the

779
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,360
biggest debates breaking the internet

780
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,640
right now. One woman in the audience is

781
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,919
outing her fiance for a secret that is

782
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,919
cringeworthy. Take a look.

783
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,919
Hey, Dr. Oz. Right now, my fiance's in

784
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,520
the shower. I think you can hear it

785
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,399
running, but that's not the only thing

786
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,760
that you hear. He literally keeps peeing

787
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,480
in the shower, and it's so gross. He's

788
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,200
not listening to me when I ask him to

789
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,200
stop. Please help me.

790
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,600
So, Summer and her fiance are here. You

791
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,200
didn't expect this, I guess. No, not at

792
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,720
all. Yeah, I mean I know I know I do

793
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,640
gross things sometimes, but I didn't

794
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,480
expect this.

795
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,559
Why do you pee in the shower? This is a

796
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,760
question all women ask us. I figured it

797
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,039
was normal. I mean, I thought most

798
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,559
people do it. No, I mean, how many

799
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,840
people pee in the shower here?

800
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,480
Notice all the men there. A couple

801
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,159
women, too. So, why does it bother you

802
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,679
so much? Why Why are all women bothered

803
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,039
by this? It's just gross, you know? I

804
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,640
mean, I shower in there. My daughter

805
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,000
showers in there sometimes. Your feet

806
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,520
are stepping on that same area. Yeah.

807
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,760
It's just gross. Didn't bother you at

808
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,520
all. I thought it was completely normal.

809
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,120
I mean, uh, I do everything in the

810
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,440
shower. I brush my teeth in there. It

811
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,760
saves time, you know? You don't You

812
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,679
don't go number two in there, right? No.

813
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,919
No. Not just number one, right? All

814
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,679
right. Come on over me. Cuz Vic, you're

815
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,480
not alone. Right. You know rapper Cardi

816
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,399
B. I do. She asked her Twitter followers

817
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,720
if they peed in the shower. Here's the

818
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,320
post, by the way. And the response, it

819
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,640
was overwhelming. She says, "Keep keep

820
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,320
it a buck. Do you pee in the shower?"

821
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,919
And all the answers in there are pretty

822
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,120
honest reflections. Most people said,

823
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,559
"Of course we do." What are you talking

824
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,080
about? So, are you ready to hear the

825
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,840
truth? Can you deal with the truth on

826
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,440
this? Yeah. Summer, all the women, can

827
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,120
you deal with the truth on this? All

828
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,440
right, come on over. Let's go through

829
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,200
the

830
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,799
numbers. So, I'm just going to knock it

831
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,200
out to you. First of all, toilet

832
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,520
flushing, it accounts for 27%. Come on

833
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,600
closer. I'm not going to bite. 27% of

834
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,000
all the water, indoor water, you come

835
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,760
over the side, um, is consumed because

836
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960
we're flushing whatever we're doing down

837
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,200
the toilet. That's a fair amount of

838
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,039
water. Yeah. Okay. One time you flush

839
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,200
it, every time you flush it, seven

840
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,799
gallons of water. Wow. Did you think

841
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,520
about that? You could take a shower,

842
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:28,000
seven gallons of water. Yeah. And peeing

843
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:30,880
in the shower, it actually saves water,

844
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,880
which saves money and therefore it's

845
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,039
good for the environment.

846
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,799
So, although I made you nervous, it

847
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,960
turns out it might not be so bad. Does

848
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,480
this influence you at all, Summer? Um, a

849
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,559
little bit. But I mean, I guess I still

850
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,679
kind of feel that it's gross, but you

851
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,760
know, now that I know that it saves

852
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,279
water, I guess it's okay. All right. So,

853
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,440
if you're worried about the ick factor,

854
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,399
which some some of of the viewers now

855
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
are, you probably still have a little

856
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,039
bit of that in the back of your mind.

857
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,799
Come on over here. Here's the thing.

858
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,320
Urine is actually produced by the

859
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,159
kidneys, as you know, right? And is

860
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,679
stored in the bladder. And there are

861
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,519
some little bacteria. Come over close to

862
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,039
me over here. Come next to me. You're

863
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,960
going to enjoy this. All right. So,

864
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,399
these bacteria are actually really

865
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,679
important. Now, we didn't even know they

866
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,039
were there till recently, but they're

867
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,960
good bacteria. They sort of protect you.

868
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,960
It's like an ecosystem in there, right?

869
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,320
And although the urine is not sterile,

870
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,080
these bacteria are pretty easy. They're

871
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,760
non-toxic. They don't become a problem

872
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,600
unless you don't pee enough or unless

873
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,200
you keep ura, which is the waste

874
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,159
material, concentrated in your body

875
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,320
because you're not letting it go out of

876
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,279
your bladder. So letting it all out,

877
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,120
letting you pee is actually fine, right?

878
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,799
It's probably better for you. Even if

879
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,399
you pee in the ground, as long as you

880
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,840
don't have it cut in your foot, you

881
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,519
don't pee on your foot, right? No, I

882
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,200
didn't think so. Then you're good to go.

883
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,559
and you're just stepping on old mats

884
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,399
that that urine's already gotten washed

885
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,679
down. So, now that you know it all, you

886
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,279
know that it's okay to pee. Probably

887
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,720
better to pee. You doesn't really matter

888
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,000
that there's a little bit of bacteria in

889
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,039
there because they're not the bad kind.

890
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,640
And you know you're saving the

891
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,640
environment. You're okay now. I feel

892
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,240
better. Much better. I do. Happy

893
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,960
customer. Congratulations. Thank you.

894
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,799
All right. Here's a question. How often

895
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,200
should you wash your face? How about

896
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,399
your hands and the towels? That might be

897
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,919
an issue here, too. The towels. How

898
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,679
often you wash them? The definitive

899
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,640
answers. And they are they are they're

900
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,880
out there. We'll share them with you.

901
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,880
That's

902
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:31,339
next. Here's your daily

903
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:31,339
[Music]

904
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,720
share. Today, we're exposing the biggest

905
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,720
bathroom secrets. I know all of you have

906
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,320
been hiding. I asked you to come clean

907
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,760
about how often you really wash your

908
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,840
face. Lots of options. Then I asked

909
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,000
about your hair. You're all over the

910
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,279
place. How about your towels? Even your

911
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,760
towels aren't always being washed the

912
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,120
same way. So, what is the real answer on

913
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,480
often you should be washing these

914
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,720
things? We're going to give you the

915
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,559
sciencebacked answers that may surprise

916
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,799
you. The first debate has to do with

917
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,279
face washing. How often should you wash

918
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,159
your face? Comes up all the time. I have

919
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,519
a twin experiment. As rare as they are,

920
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,000
they'll help us find the answer.

921
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,240
Identical twins, Najanique and Nea are

922
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,560
here. Welcome to the show. Thank you.

923
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,599
Nani, start us off. How often do you

924
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,079
wash your face? Once a day. Once a day.

925
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,399
And Naja? Twice a day. Twice a day. You

926
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,079
both look the same still. Your mom can

927
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,200
probably tell you apart, but most of us

928
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,800
will be a bit confused, but it's a

929
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,079
perfect twin experiment. Theoretically,

930
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,040
you're genetically the same, so we

931
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,560
should be able to figure out if it makes

932
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,159
a difference to go once a day or more

933
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,560
than once a day. So we use cutting edge

934
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,320
imaging technology called Canfield Vizia

935
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,679
complexion anal an analyst system. Come

936
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,200
on over. That'll help us find out how

937
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,040
often you should really wash your face.

938
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,480
Now it's going to give us an idea of how

939
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,839
many bacteria you have up there. We're

940
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,079
going to take a look at nausea skin

941
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,399
first. This is what washing your face

942
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,079
twice a day, twice a day looks like

943
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,760
through a microscopic lens. Each of the

944
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,520
little dots represents sort of a

945
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,520
bacteria count. Are you ready for the

946
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,440
answer? Ready. Your score was 2347.

947
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,359
That's the instances of bacteria on her

948
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,960
face. Now let's take a look at her twin

949
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:07,720
Nanique. Her face is next to her sisters

950
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,200
who washes only once a day and she has

951
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,440
2,28 instances of bacteria on her face.

952
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,000
There's no benefit. There's no benefit

953
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,079
of washing more. So it turns out that

954
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
just looking at this data, washing your

955
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,320
face once a day is enough. What do you

956
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,960
guys think about that? I'm shocked

957
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,640
because I would think twice a day would

958
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,800
at least make that number significantly

959
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,160
lower than that one, but that's very

960
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,119
surprising to me. That's why it's sort

961
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,720
of good to look at what's really

962
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,720
happening. Such a common problem. Let's

963
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,040
bring in Dr. Dennyman. Uh she's a

964
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,160
world-class

965
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,760
dermatologist. Daniel Angelman knows

966
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,240
everything about this. I need the final

967
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,160
answer here, which is uh just from this

968
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,400
information, it seems to me that once a

969
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,480
day is enough. Yes. How do you paint the

970
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,800
picture for our twins? Yes, please. Once

971
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,280
a day is often enough, and especially if

972
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,320
you have dry or mature skin, once a day

973
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,480
is plenty. If you're oily or acne prone,

974
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,920
you know, you can go twice a day without

975
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,320
stripping your skins of your natural

976
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,079
oils. But the secret is not to wash more

977
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,880
than twice a day. How often do you wash

978
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,800
your face a day? I do washing a thorough

979
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,800
washing at night and then I just tone in

980
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,560
the morning. There you have it. Do with

981
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,240
the dermatologist. All right. Is that

982
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,440
helpful? Thank you. Yes. Tell tell your

983
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,960
mom she raised very pretty young woman.

984
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,280
Beautiful. Thank you. I appreciate it.

985
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,800
No matter what your scars are. Thank you

986
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,240
very much. All right. Next debate. How

987
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,440
often do you wash your hair? Right. Lot

988
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,119
of debate here. There's been a big

989
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,800
movement to stop washing your hair.

990
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,720
Let's come on over here. We've got two

991
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,800
guests from the show who have different

992
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,320
philosophies. Lauren, how many days a

993
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,160
week do you wash your hair? I wash my

994
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,680
hair every single day. Seven times a

995
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,040
week. That's right. Very You do

996
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,599
everything else rigid. Rigid like that

997
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,200
or you're pretty flexible. No, the thing

998
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,880
just just once once a day for my hair

999
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,560
because I work out almost every day is

1000
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,160
kind of the one thing I stick to and

1001
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,839
showering, but other than that. All

1002
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,839
right. And we got Megan here who has a

1003
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,560
different philosophy about hair washing.

1004
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,040
I wash my hair like two to three times a

1005
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,720
week. Uhhuh. All right. Walk us through

1006
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,400
as we have a basic oil test to help

1007
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,400
figure out who's wiser. So, I'm going to

1008
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,480
use these blotting sheets just to see

1009
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,920
how much oil is at the root of the hair.

1010
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,640
And so, I'm going to start first with

1011
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,000
Lauren, who we know she washes daily.

1012
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,760
And she works out and that makes sense.

1013
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
A lot of my patients who work out, but

1014
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,520
see how much oil there is there. Yeah.

1015
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,440
Let me hold that. Yes. And then Megan,

1016
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,119
who's only two to three times a week.

1017
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,480
Okay. Let's see what we're making this.

1018
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,480
I've got my

1019
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,119
Oddly, oh my goodness. Less oil. How was

1020
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,079
that? Wait a second. The once a day hair

1021
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,440
has more oil than the twice a week hair.

1022
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,880
Yeah. And these results are quite

1023
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,560
shocking and surprising, right? Because

1024
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,560
you would think if you wash more, your

1025
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,160
hair would be cleaner and less oily.

1026
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,760
Well, how do you explain this? So, the

1027
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,280
way that I explain it to my patients,

1028
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,760
and it sounds a little scientific, but

1029
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,440
if we stimulate the hair follicles,

1030
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,040
we're actually stimulating the sebaceous

1031
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,800
glands at the root of those when we're

1032
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,480
washing, and it increases oil

1033
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,160
production. So, actually, you can have

1034
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,240
oiler hair even though you're washing

1035
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,359
more. Look at the smile on her face. She

1036
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,800
just loves being right. Just doesn't eat

1037
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,400
at you a little bit. I feel triggered.

1038
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,000
All right, let me explain. Come on over.

1039
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,839
We got a little animational. So, when we

1040
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,760
wash our scalps less, it actually

1041
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,880
changes lots of things. And I'm going to

1042
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,119
demonstrate it for you because here we

1043
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,400
are with doc with Dendi sitting here in

1044
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,400
the middle of our scalp. And when you

1045
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,800
when you wash your scalp less. You see

1046
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,960
down here you got some oil. You actually

1047
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,119
produce less oil. The body naturally

1048
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,720
produces its oil at its own pace. So it

1049
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,560
disrupts your body system when you

1050
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,640
shampoo too often. It'll throw your oil

1051
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,400
production out of wax. So more washing,

1052
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,480
more scrubbing under my feet here,

1053
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,440
right? Translates to more oil. Look down

1054
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,280
here. See the oil? More oil down there.

1055
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,440
And here's the bigger problem. If you

1056
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,960
shampoo your hair every single day,

1057
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,560
you're ultimately gonna strip away the

1058
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,680
natural oils and it can lead to dry,

1059
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,960
brittle hair, which you don't want

1060
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,680
either. So, bottom line, wash your hair,

1061
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,200
not every day, every other day, every

1062
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,320
third. I agree. Did I get it right? You

1063
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,480
got it right. A+

1064
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,800
A+. Before we go to break, we asked our

1065
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,839
audience how often you wash your towels.

1066
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,040
Now, 46% of you said once a week. We

1067
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,720
asked the experts at the Good

1068
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,160
Housekeeping lab to reveal the truth

1069
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,790
about how often you should be washing

1070
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,880
your towels. Pay attention to their

1071

1072
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,400
advice. Hi, Dr. Oz. It's Carolyn Forte

1073
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,320
from the Good Housekeeping Cleaning Lab.

1074
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,079
You're asking about bath towels. We

1075
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,000
recommend that you wash them after every

1076
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,599
3 to four uses. You're coming out of the

1077
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,359
shower, you're clean, so they really

1078
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,200
don't get that dirty. Just make sure you

1079
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,440
hang them up between uses so they don't

1080
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,440
get moldy.

1081
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:36,560
Giant fibroids. This was about 70 lbs.

1082
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,960
Painful fibroids. It can crush organs.

1083
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,520
So many women suffer in silence. It has

1084
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,580
hurt the intimacy. Absolutely.

1085
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,839
That's coming up on

1087
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:51,359
Monday. Today, we're exposing the

1088
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,599
biggest bathroom secrets you've all been

1089
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,359
hiding until now. We're asking the

1090
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,400
question, could you be brushing your

1091
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,079
teeth with poop particles

1092
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,320
and not even know it? Does it have your

1093
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,000
attention? I thought so because what I'm

1094
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,200
about to show you will change the way

1095
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,839
you flush forever. And Kimberly is going

1096
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,520
to help explain all this to us. Thank

1097
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,440
you for being here. Thank you for having

1098
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,359
me. So, let's start with a simple

1099
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,119
question. When you flush your toilet, do

1100
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,000
you normally put the lid down? Does it

1101
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,640
matter to you? Um, most of the time, but

1102
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,560
sometimes I don't. So, well, I think

1103
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,160
most of America just flushes. What's the

1104
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,760
big deal, right? It's your bathroom.

1105
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,200
It's going to stay in there anyway.

1106
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,720
That's what I think. You probably think

1107
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,440
that, too. Have you ever heard something

1108
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,400
called the toilet plume? No. Never.

1109
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,839
Interesting word, isn't it? Toilet

1110
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,119
plume. Yeah, it is. Official definition.

1111
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,599
It's the term for what happens when the

1112
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,359
force of flushing sprays microscopic

1113
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,359
particles into the air. That's what it

1114
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,200
is. Kimberly, just to demonstrate a

1115
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,400
toilet plume, if you don't mind, just

1116
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,240
put your finger over there and flush

1117
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:58,440
there. Just push it down. Yep. Whoa,

1118
00:40:53,240 --> 00:41:01,960
whoa, whoa, whoa. I mean, we've got

1119
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,240
stuff plopping all over the place. Right

1120
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,319
now, it might look pretty having this

1121
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,880
confetti flying around here. I sort of

1122
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,319
like the gymnastics of it, but I'm going

1123
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,160
to assure you something. The stuff

1124
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,720
flowing out of there is not as benign as

1125
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,280
pieces of confetti. It could be pieces

1126
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,920
of poop, pieces of urine. It could be

1127
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,359
lingering stuff in your bowl. How's that

1128
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,319
make you feel about the toilet bowl? Um,

1129
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,920
it does not make me feel good at all.

1130
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,880
So, you might notice how it's played all

1131
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,280
over here, right? It seems pretty

1132
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,640
dramatic, maybe overly. So, yeah, people

1133
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,440
have actually studied what happens to

1134
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,119
that toilet plume and how big it is. Let

1135
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,960
me show you how far away it will reach.

1136
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,720
Hold the end here and start stretching

1137
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,040
it towards that counter there. Keep

1138
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,240
going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep

1139
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,119
going. Keep going. Stop. That's as far

1140
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,680
as it goes. Six feet. Wow. Now notice

1141
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,200
what's in between the toilet and six

1142
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,280
feet away. The toothbrush. The

1143
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,200
toothbrushes. Right. The poop makes its

1144
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,040
way to your sink and everything around

1145
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,480
it, including your soap, but most

1146
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,960
importantly, your toothbrushes, cuz you

1147
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,480
put them in your mouth. Disgusting. How

1148
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,000
does that make you feel about your

1149
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,240
dental hygiene practices? It needs to be

1150
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,800
wrapped up. Like all of this needs to be

1151
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,640
wrapped up or put someplace else. Like I

1152
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,160
tell you what I would do instead. It's

1153
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,160
much easier. I go like

1154
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,480
this. Then it's all done with. So, a

1155
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,839
partying gift to you. A measuring tape

1156
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,200
to see how far your toothbrushes are

1157
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,680
from the toilet. You can keep those

1158
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,000
toothbrushes. They're clean. I'll take

1159
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,359
my chances and not take them with me.

1160
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,119
Together, change is happening. Your

1161
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,319
journey is just beginning. Close your

1162
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:47,400
toilet lids.

1163
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,400
Nicely done. Thank you. Thank you.
