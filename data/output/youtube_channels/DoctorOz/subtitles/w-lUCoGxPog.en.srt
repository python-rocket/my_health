1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
He was one of the biggest teen idols in

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,200
the world with hit records, global

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,360
tours, and TV specials. His face was all

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,200
over magazines and posters that

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,840
plastered the bedroom walls of millions

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,920
of teens. But for actor and singer Leif

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,640
Garrett, the glare of all that instant

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,560
fame led him to self-destruction into

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,800
addictions that almost took not only his

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,560
life, but his friends as well. Today,

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,480
he's burying his soul and revealing his

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,679
darkest secrets about how he survived.

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,079
He shot onto the scene in the late 60s,

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,000
appearing in the hottest TV shows and

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,559
even landing a role in the movie that

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,559
defined the decade, Bob and Carol and

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,640
Ted and

18
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,360
Alice. But his teen heartthrob status

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,840
skyrocketed to pop superstardom when he

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,440
recorded the hit single I Was Made for

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,039
Dancing in 1978. From there, the sky was

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,879
the limit for 16-year-old Le Garrett.

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,520
But being raised by a single working

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,520
mom, Leif lacked a father figure in his

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,840
life. Like many child stars with little

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,000
or no adult supervision on the road, he

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,640
would turn to drugs and alcohol at an

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,880
early

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,960
age. With international fame, Leif was

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,200
running with an A-list crowd and was

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,680
given a free pass to do whatever he

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,560
pleased. He was exposed to an endless

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,520
supply of alcohol, drugs, women, and

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,920
near brushes with

35
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,320
death. By the 90s, the handsome teen

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,640
idol looked like this. His downward

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
spiral continued with Leif making

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,880
headline after headline for drug arrests

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,479
and

40
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,560
relapses. Now he's coming clean about

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,590
all of it and what saved him from his

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,240
addictions and painful

43
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,360
[Music]

44
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,320
past. Dave Garrett is here in person.

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,320
You know, we heard the highs and the

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,399
lows. how you survived still a miracle

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,399
for many of us to contemplate. Why did

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,799
you decide to open up now to tell your

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,520
story?

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,479
It was the right time. Um I've lived

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,520
with some of these uh if you will

52
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,679
secrets for uh quite a while and I I

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,599
just needed to clear my conscience, you

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,920
know.

55
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,920
Um, and also if anything, if I can help

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
somebody give, you know, give advice

57
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,959
what to look out for or something like

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,720
that, then, you know, that's that's even

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,599
better. It's, you know, but I just I

60
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,920
really wanted to uh just tell my story

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,120
and and and let people know directly

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,519
from me what it's about. You you in your

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,040
book, which is fantastic, Idol Truth.

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you. Uh you talk about your

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,040
childhood about the difficulties uh in

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,360
your family. Yeah. So your mom's by

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,920
herself as you and your sister, right?

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,920
Yes. Decides to put put you into acting

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,239
and all of a sudden overnight you're an

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,080
incredible child star. What was that

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,040
like? Uh it was great. I loved it. You

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,319
know, it was it's um you know, it was

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,200
first of all, I didn't have to go to

74
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,000
school, regular school. That's good. So

75
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,920
um you know it uh it was just fun too.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,239
It was it was like playtime almost you

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,879
know and uh yeah so you're you're riding

78
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,040
high. Now on our show we have talked

79
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,400
about pedophiles in Hollywood. This is

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,920
something that you all become aware of

81
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,599
because we've been harping on it because

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,159
these are unprotected young people.

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,800
There was a producer since passed away

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,640
uh that was reported by others not you

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800
to have been a sexual predator of young

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,440
boys. Mhm. I know you know this story

87
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,040
and apparently he approached you and

88
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,239
your mom actually more about your

89
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,799
career.

90
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,040
Yeah, he it was under the you know we we

91
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,280
just came back from Israel where we were

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,799
for six months and I was I did two films

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,959
over there and uh we came back uh you

94
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,080
know all of a sudden we've got somebody

95
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,000
who's Warren Batty's cousin uh who's

96
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,720
associate producer on all of his films

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,840
and things like that and he uh you know

98
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,000
was basically under the guise of you

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,760
know uh get you into a film with Warren

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,599
and and all this and further your career

101
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,200
and nothing ever came of any of that. It

102
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,799
was it was it was creepy. My mom

103
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,200
didn't I I I just I I don't understand

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
the the train of thought of trusting

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
somebody that you don't really know,

106
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,320
someone you just met just because that

107
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,400
they're involved in the film business in

108
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,880
a rather good position, so to speak. Um

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,080
you know, and Warren B's cousin. As you

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,360
look back on interactions with that

111
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,520
gentleman, were there signs that he may

112
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,800
have been grooming you?

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,120
Absolutely. Absolutely. I didn't I was

114
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,639
very naive as well, but also very young,

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:46,160
you know. How old were you? I was 15,

116
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,520
16. Yeah, I was 15. Um, and uh we we

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,840
played raetball. First of all, he knew

118
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,720
Led Zeppelin was my favorite band. So,

119
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,479
bringing me to a concert, Led Zeppelin

120
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,720
77, uh getting a really nice Jaguar,

124
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,479
that you know and you were 50 and how

125
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,440

126
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,080
late 30s something like that you know

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,880
maybe mid30s and yet there's not it was

128
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,199
an innocent time for all of us it was

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,440
it's it's nowadays you this just this

130
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,000
this wouldn't go down like that you know

131
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,160
it's so let's talk about November the

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,720
3rd

133
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,120
1979 I'm sitting in Boston in college

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,919
and you're almost dying. You're high on

135
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,000
quaudes. Yep. It's uh your 18th birthday

136
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,520
is around then. Yeah, it was uh 5 days

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,080
later. So about same age. Uh Dave's car

138
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,919
is on an LA freeway. He crashes it and

139
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,759
it leaves his friend in the passenger

140
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,600
seat at parapolgic for life. Yeah. What

141
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
really happened that night? What led to

142
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,360
the accident?

143
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,479
Well,

144
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,199
um just a group of young people hanging

145
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,560
out together, drinking, taking

146
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,600
substances um and because we're feeling

147
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,840
the down effects, looking for something

148
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:15,759
to lift us up and um we were elected the

149
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,360
ones to go find cocaine. So, you're on

150
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,800
you're high on quao and been drinking.

151
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,280
So, you're partying with your friends.

152
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,720
The two of you leave. Yep. Would you

153
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,120
drive in that state now? Hell no. Do do

154
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,560
you remember the accident? Yeah,

155
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,400
absolutely. Quite vividly.

156
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,080
Um drive we'd actually passed the place

157
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
the exit that we knew we were supposed

158
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,240
to get off on a couple of times.

159
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:43,120
Apparently higher than we thought. Um

160
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,360
and heading back towards the house, he

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
fell asleep. And I had no idea that

162
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,400
sometimes he fell asleep with his eyes

163
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,919
open.

164
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,919
And I'm holding the steering wheel like

165
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,840
this and I reached over to to, you know,

166
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,120
see if he's okay and just it

167
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,520
car, you know, with the steering the

168
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,479
steering wheel it we uh clipped the rear

169
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,440
end of a another car which spun us

170
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,599
around and then hit the curb and it went

171
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,560
like that down an 80 foot. Flipped over

172
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,199
80 feet. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my goodness.

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,400
Yeah. And uh he was he was yelling at me

174
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,240
to to straighten his legs

175
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:22,319
out and his legs were already

176
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,319
straight and the scent of gasoline was

177
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,599
rather overwhelming and the people who I

178
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:32,319
clipped were standing up at the

179
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:35,840
top yelling at me. You know what I was I

180
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,840
crazy you little and and blah blah and

181
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm just trying to get help. So I there

182
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,199
used to be the call boxes. Yeah. Um, and

183
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,759
so went up and and I actually was the

184
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,479
one to make the phone call to call the

185
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,680
police and and have them come. And you

186
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,720
divide your life into before November

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,520
3rd and after the accident. Yeah. How

188
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,000
has it changed you?

189
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,240
Well, I'm I'm a big- time advocate of

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,280
take a

191
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:10,000
cab. Um, don't drink and drive. Um, and

192
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,400
uh, I wasn't as as close a friend with

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,599
the gentleman as you know, Roland as I

194
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,360
was is his name. He has since passed on.

195
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,360
Sorry. Um, yeah. Um,

196
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,960
but it's it's kind of, you know, you got

197
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,560
I had to make better. I wasn't making

198
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,720
great decisions. I

199
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,959
was disillusioned in my own career and

200
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,880
my life at the time.

201
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:38,959
um taking things I should not have been

202
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,680
taking um but didn't have the parental

203
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,399
guidance that I truly needed. I honestly

204
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,519
wish that I had more discipline in my

205
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,279
life. I truly honestly wished I had

206
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,760
somebody telling me no instead of always

207
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,680
being told sure kid whatever you want.

208
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,839
So coming up the rock bottom moment that

209
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,320
Le says changed everything. Stick with

210
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,320
us. We are back with former teen

211
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,240
heartthrob Leif Garrett who's revealing

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
the truth about his addictions. Now, in

213
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,480
the wake of a car accident that rendered

214
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,640
his friend a parapolgic for life, life

215
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,720
says his life continued to spiral out of

216
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,959
control. And one of the rockiest times

217
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,560
you argue is when you broke up with

218
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,320
Nicolet Sheridan, which I can understand

219
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,399
how it hit you hard on top of all other

220
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,600
things were going on. Why did the

221
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:30,200
relationship end? How did it end?

222
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,760
My my career was at that time started

223
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,760
down. Her career was starting up and we

224
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,560
either got we were best friends in the

225
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,959
whole world or we cleared rooms. I mean

226
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:47,040
it was Was she the love of your life?

227
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:49,800
Yes. Yes. Um she uh she was my first

228
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,160
real

229
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,839
um deep deep love.

230
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,360
So, in the meantime, you turned to

231
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,480
partying and you continued to crumble

232
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,000
under the weight of your addictions. I'm

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,760
going to read this little excerpt from

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,839
Idol Truth because I think it was

235
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,839
compelling. Uh, I could handle the

236
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,040
drinking. I could handle the cocaine. I

237
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,800
could handle the quaudes. The heroin was

238
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,839
a whole other story. When did you start

239
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,920
using heroin? Oh, man. That was it was

240
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:25,760
much later on um in my life.

241
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:28,839
Um, it was when I was trying to

242
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,480
resurrect the musical

243
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,760
career

244
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:40,000
and all of my heroes in

245
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:41,440
music were known to partake and and a

246
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,760
lot of them like, you know, Keith

247
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,320
Richards, um, you know, any of the guys

248
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,480
from the Stones, Aerosmith, um,

249
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,079
Zeppelin, you know, I thought being

250
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:56,160
categorized in that sort the group would

251
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:58,079
maybe further or help my moving on to

252
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,600
the rock and roll, the real rock and

253
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,880
roll, you know. So, you get up to $300 a

254
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,600
day smoking blacktar heroin. Yes. When

255
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,839
did you finally hit rock bottom? I think

256
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,680
uh three months in county jail was

257
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,279
pretty much Yeah, that that was Yeah,

258
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
there's a that's a great photo right

259
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,120
there, isn't it? That's a good one. That

260
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,120
that haunts the hell out of me, that

261
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,760
photograph. I got to for good reason.

262
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,279
Yeah, exactly. So, Shabbou came out this

263
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,640
week and said getting arrested,

264
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,720
which happened while I was making my

265
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,240
brother-in-law's movie, by the way. Wow.

266
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,000
Uh, saved his life. Did these guys save

267
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:41,120
your life?

268
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,720
Huh? I guess in a in a in a in a very

269
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,800
profound way. Yeah. you know, because

270
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,800
being locked up is, you know, not having

271
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:55,640
your freedom is is a really

272
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,079
strong signal, you know, it's it's

273
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:01,760
very I don't think you realize how

274
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,000
important it is until you lose it, you

275
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,639
know, as as such with many things, you

276
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,560
know. Yeah. How has your recovery been?

277
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,800
I've had my ups and downs with it, you

278
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,120
know, take it one day at a time. I found

279
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,880
though, it's interesting because a lot

280
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,639
of

281
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,399
people subscribe to the the meetings and

282
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,560
things like that. I personally found

283
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,720
every time I went to the the meetings, I

284
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,480
wanted to use more afterwards because

285
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,560
people get up and talk and they're like,

286
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,720
"Oh man, I remember when we this and it

287
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,360
was so great and we were hiring a kite

288
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,760
and we

289
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,519
d and it's a big pickup joint, you know,

290
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,079
right? Oh, I swear to God, it's so funny

291
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,760
because everyone is there changing one

292
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,920
addiction for another one. And you

293
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,160
cannot get sober unless you want to

294
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,079
quit. Um, but you have to to

295
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,120
to check out the things that made you

296
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,279
start using in the first place and then

297
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,399
want to not do it. Come on over with me.

298
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,000
I want you to share something. This

299
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,600
audience loves you. And I love them.

300
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
They're

301
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,040
they're representing the pain that a lot

302
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,880
of Americans feel because addiction is

303
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,880
such a big part of our lives. So, come

304
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,320
join me on the stoop here. Have a seat.

305
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,279
All right. I'll I'll turn it over to

306
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,800
you. What's the advice you would give

307
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,399
folks about addiction? What would you

308
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,560
have to say to folks who are struggling

309
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,440
right now? Where where you were when you

310
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,440
got put in

311
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,680
jail? You got to figure out if that's

312
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:31,040
the road you want to continue down. It's

313
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,040
not a pleasant road. It's um a lot

314
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:39,040
of it's a lot of pain and suffering and

315
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,120
it's important to want to not do it

316
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,200
because you can't stop unless you want

317
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,040
to stop.

318
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,120
