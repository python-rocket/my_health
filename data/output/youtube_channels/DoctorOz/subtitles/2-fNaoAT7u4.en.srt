It's backyard burger season. Turkey,

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,040
chicken, and veggie burgers. You're

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,280
probably not getting the nutrition that

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,960
you think you are, but what's really the

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,639
healthiest option? You think veggie

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,280
burger has to have veggies in them,

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,880
right? And the ultimate Oz approved beef

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,680
burger. This is a cookout classic. Plus,

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,000
online memory boosters. What's really in

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,439
these pills? Are they helpful or

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,439
harmful? Coming up next.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,640
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

Today, an investigation into the hottest

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,879
debate about one of America's most

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,960
beloved and classic foods, burgers. We

21
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,520
all adore them, right? That's right.

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,280
Applaud them. Is there really a better

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,880
backyard burger? That's our question

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,479
today. And we listen. We got the beef,

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,799
we got the turkey, there's chicken,

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,720
there's veggie, right? Which one should

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,240
you be eating? We're revealing what's

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,080
really in the store-bought burger

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,920
patties that you're grilling and how to

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
find the perfect mouthwatering burger

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,320
that even a heart surgeon like me would

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,560
crave. Nutritionist Kellyanne Patruchi

33
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,920
and butcher Justin DeMarco have been

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
experimenting, you can see it right

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,680
there, with burgers in their own

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,280
backyards. And we had them buy, cook,

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
and taste all kinds of supermarket

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
burgers out there. Let's start with

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,560
Kellyanne's experiment with turkey

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,280
burgers.

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,000
Hey there. I'm out here grilling up some

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,840
turkey burgers. You know what? A lot of

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,079
people think turkey burgers are the

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,399
healthiest option when shopping for

45
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,360
burgers in the supermarket, but if you

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,680
buy fresh, and even if you buy frozen,

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,600
that may not be the case. These turkey

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,920
burgers may not be as lean and as mean

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,079
as you think. So, depending on the cut

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,719
or the type of meat, these turkey

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,000
burgers may actually have as much fat in

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,760
them as regular beef burgers. But now,

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,480
my real question is, why? Why? Why? Why?

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,200
Our turkey burgers so dry. Well, I am

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,280
gonna get to the bottom of that.

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,800
All right, Justinian are here in studio.

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,480
Just you looked into frozen turkey

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
burger patties. What did you find? As a

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,840
butcher, tell me the truth. Okay, so

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,760
what I found was that turkey burgers,

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,200
unless said otherwise on the label.

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,440
Majority of the ingredients are the

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,360
tenderloin, the thighs, and the breast.

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,160
What I also found in some cases was they

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
would add skin and fat to them. So, and

66
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,800
dark meat actually. So, what would

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,720
happen with that? it was an increase of

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,400
fat. In most cases, you would think that

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,640
would add to the flavor, but not

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,599
necessarily. So, so what they typically

71
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,840
do is they add dextrose, brown sugar to

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,920
try and beef up that burger flavor in

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,599
the turkey. You found another key

74
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,480
ingredient, Kelly, and I was concerning

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,400
because I thought it was just regular

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,480
old turkey. We all do. We all do. But

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,680
here's the thing. You could actually

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,920
have salt, sodium, and up to 900 grams

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,879
of this stuff. So, that's a lot. So, I

80
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,959
want everyone to put this in

81
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,599
perspective. That's like you go to a

82
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,480
fast food restaurant and you order four

83
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,000
mediumsiz fries. Okay. So, you can

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
imagine that's going to make you retain

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
a lot of water or could make you retain

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
water and that's going to make you feel

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
and look bloated, which doesn't make

88
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,519
good for a date night. That's right. It

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
is the worst thing for date night. But

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,959
is the purpose of the salt to increase

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
flavor as Justin points out that they

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,080
need to do something to beef it up, so

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
to speak. Well, perhaps that's one of

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,879
the the things that they can do and

95
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,239
there's but there's other ways that they

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,480
can do that. So, if they add some

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,080
spices, that's great, but salt is is

98
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,280
just not good. So, what do you look for

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,040
in the label? And then you give me a

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
hack to make it taste better. So, what

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,560
you want to look for is 90% lean white

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,319
turkey meat. That's the thing. And I

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
also look for organic because then I

104
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,959
don't have to worry about antibiotics.

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,959
It just kind of takes that off the

106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,879
table. And if they add some spices in

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,560
there like rosemary or salt or something

108
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,000
like that, great. And they're in there.

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,000
I got to say my biggest concern with

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,480
turkey burgers is sometimes I mean they

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
get dry, right? Is that the big problem?

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,439
You're chewing on cardboard after a

113
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,959
while. But you got a hack. What do you

114
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,640
recommend? All right. So, Dr. Oz,

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,560
Kellyanne over here gave me a little bit

116
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,919
of information about you. And that

117
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,079
information was 2% Greek yogurt. Okay.

118
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,240
So, one pound of turkey chop meat. We're

119
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,520
going to do half a cup of Greek yogurt,

120
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,840
a little bit of bread. What that does,

121
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,320
it binds a burger together. And so, your

122
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,680
end result is a nice juicy flavorful

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,639
turkey burger. Cook it the same way.

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,320
Absolutely. Great idea. Next up, we

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,160
asked Justin to do a cookout experiment

126
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,880
with chicken burger patties. Take a

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,880
look. Hey, Dr. Oz. Justin from the Chop

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,800
Shop here with your chicken burger

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,720
experiment. If you see in front of me,

130
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,400
I've got two chicken burgers here, a

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,320
frozen and a fresh. Now, you asked me to

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
deconstruct these burgers to find out

133
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,479
what actually goes into them. Now, just

134
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
like turkey burgers, chicken burgers can

135
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,520
be made with different parts of the

136
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,160
chicken. They can have natural flavors

137
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
and even sugar added to them. Now, on

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,120
the other hand, have you ever had any

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
problems with your burgers sticking to

140
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,400
the grill? I got a surefire hack to help

141
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,320
you with that. First

142
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:20,160
thing, nice onion. Second thing, fork,

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,160
nice hot grill. Place it down. Couple

144
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,360
rubs. Grab your favorite chicken burger,

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,360
beef burger.

146
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,800
There you go. A non-stick burger. Dr.

147
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,280
Oz, that's your chicken burger

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,120
experiment. That is such a good hack,

149
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,560
Justin. It's so simple, right? Sure is.

150
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,080
Sure is. And the black gloves look like

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,080
a mortician, by the way. Well, it's kind

152
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,120
of my my my emmo. Oh, it is. I have

153
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,720
purple ones for you if you want. All

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,000
right, I'll grab you. When you looked at

155
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,919
the ingredient list, what surprised you

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,320
about these? Well, it actually surprised

157
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,320
me a lot, but in a good way because the

158
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,520
nutritional profile is really solid.

159
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,240
You've got about 150 to about 210

160
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,280
calories. That's great. And the protein

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,120
about 14 to about 25 grams of protein.

162
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,479
So that's a really good balance. That's

163
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,520
fantastic. Yeah. And Justin, what do you

164
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,440
look for when you're buying in the store

165
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,639
to make sure you get a tasty burger? So

166
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,080
what you do want to look for is

167
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
obviously the primary ingredient that

168
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
the first ingredient would be chicken,

169
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,199
which would you assume? The rule of

170
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,039
thumb, by the way, if the first word in

171
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
the label is not the first word in the

172
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,440
ingredient list, you got a problem.

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,960
Correct. So it's chicken. There should

174
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,319
be chicken and chicken. And then even

175
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
after that, it would be the chicken

176
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,759
obviously would be breast or thigh. And

177
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,360
then after that, you don't want to have

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,240
any other really ingredients such as

179
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,080
preservatives or salts or like Kellyanne

180
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,160
said, you want to add that stuff after.

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,600
And a big thing for me is is to have a

182
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,440
chicken burger that's made with chicken

183
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,560
that was raised without antibiotics.

184
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,919
Okay. So, you're both on the same page

185
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,280
now. Absolutely. All right. Next up,

186
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
veggie burgers. These are growing in

187
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,720
popularity. Now, to be fair, there's

188
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,400
some health issues to talk about, but

189
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,759
there's also some taste problems b with

190
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,759
burgers. So, I'm going to do a live

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,160
taste test right here on the set with a

192
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,680
butcher. Justin start eating away. I

193
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,039
want honest opinion from you. compare it

194
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,400
to actually don't compare it to a

195
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,160
regular burger. Tell me if it's good

196
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,919
enough on its own. Kellyanne, what did

197
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,360
you uncover about how many veggies are

198
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
actually in the burgers? Well, here's

199
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,319
what's interesting because you think

200
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
veggie burger it has to have veggies in

201
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,360
them, right? Well, a lot of the

202
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,960
companies do. They have things like

203
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,960
mushroom and they have kale and they

204
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,039
have beans and it's it's great. But then

205
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,919
a lot of the companies, believe it or

206
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,199
not, it wasn't until about the fourth

207
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,120
ingredient that veggies even showed up

208
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,880
in any natural form. What they did

209
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
instead was the first ingredient often

210
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,400
times was water. And then you get into

211
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,560
like soy protein isolate, soy protein

212
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,080
concentrate and processed proteins.

213
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
Yeah, it's processed protein. So if you

214
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,720
think you're getting something like

215
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,720
edetomame, you think you're getting

216
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,080
something like soy, but in fact you're

217
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
not. And while I'm not saying these are

218
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,599
dangerous, what I am saying is you're

219
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,360
probably not getting the nutrition that

220
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,960
you think you are. Well, speaking of

221
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
that, how does it stack up in nutrition

222
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,199
compared to what we've been talking

223
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,720
about to a beef burger, for example?

224
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,639
Okay, so let's start with a beef burger.

225
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,800
Start with the protein because we all

226
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,240
know that in a beef burger, we always

227
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,840
look to the protein. You're going to

228
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,360
find about 22 grams of protein in a beef

229
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,240
burger. In a veggie burger, you're going

230
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,840
to find about four to about 23 grams of

231
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,599
protein in there. Four to 20. It's a

232
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,960
huge It's a huge spread. So, here's what

233
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,160
you do. So, if you're thinking, you

234
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,919
know, I really want this veggie burger,

235
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,680
but there's not enough protein for me.

236
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,879
You want to pair it up. So, a lot of

237
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,039
times you'll pair it up with maybe a

238
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,960
side of beans or you do what I do, which

239
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,560
is you put an egg sunny side up. You

240
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,479
crack an egg over that and that works

241
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,479
really nicely. And then so we look at

242
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,120
the calories. So the calories in a beef

243
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,280
burger, you're going to run into about

244
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,440
350 calories for a beef burger. And for

245
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,120
about a veggie burger, it's about 100.

246
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,720
So better on calories. Actually, better

247
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
on calories. We can hack the protein.

248
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,280
It's good on the calories. Yeah. Okay.

249
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,200
Now the big question because the

250
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,800
audience generally thinks about veggie

251
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,919
burgers and say why bother at that

252
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,719
point. What do you think about the

253
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,560
veggie burger? Uh coming from a beef

254
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919
perspective, it lacks a little bit of

255
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,440
flavor. Okay. But it's a good

256
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,279
alternative. If you want a healthier,

257
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,200
you know, kind of meal. It was a little

258
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,399
bit dry. A little dry. It was a little

259
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,480
dry. I could have added yogurt and

260
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,839
bread. You can you could you with this

261
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
you would add a condiment to it and

262
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,680
obviously a healthier one if you could.

263
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,399
But as far as you know, for my palette,

264
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,680
it was a little bit dry. Killjoy. Kill

265
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,120
joy. It's just not worth it. Would I say

266
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,399
I was I was trying to tempt you to say

267
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,000
this, but I'm going to say it myself.

268
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,120
Don't compare a veggie burger to a beef

269
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
burger. They're not supposed to be the

270
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,640
same thing. They taste different. Polar

271
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
opposite. Yeah. So, if you can get used

272
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,839
to it, is does it taste good enough on

273
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
its own is the question you should be

274
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,959
asking yourself. If you didn't have any

275
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,800
beef burgers in the universe, would you

276
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,560
be accepting of a big I would accept it?

277
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,399
Absolutely. There we go. Now we talking.

278
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,360
All right. Nutrition. Give me a list

279
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,320
down. What should you be looking for

280
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
when you're buying a veggie burger? So,

281
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,959
when you're looking The first thing I

282
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,560
want everyone to realize is that you may

283
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,000
think that you're looking or getting a

284
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,200
healthier option. You're not. Actually,

285
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,120
these are supposed to be eaten in

286
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,480
moderation. So, keep that in mind. You

287
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,320
want to look for USDA certified organic.

288
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,720
The calories you want to run at stay at

289
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,160
about 200 or or even below. And with

290
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,760
veggie burgers, you can get a little bit

291
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,600
of fiber. So, you want to look for about

292
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
six grams of fiber. All right. So, up

293
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,519
next, the investigation into backyard

294
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,360
burgers continues with the ultimate Oz

295
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,360
approved beef burger that everyone's

296
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
craving for for their summer cookout.

297
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
We're going to find out how you can save

298
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,240
calories and still be satisfied. Even

299
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,040
Justin the Butcher will be happy with

300
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,040
every bite. Stick around.

301
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,610
[Applause]

302
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,610
[Music]

303
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,279
We're back with our backyard burger

304
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,720
investigation. We just talked about

305
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,399
turkey and then chicken and we did

306
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,440
veggie burgers, but now it is time to

307
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,200
tackle the most popular and classic, the

308
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,800
beef burger. I know you're waiting for

309
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,200
it. There's nothing better than biting

310
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,680
into a big juicy beef burger. Even heart

311
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,880
surgeons love burgers once in a while.

312
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,880
Look at me here. This is actually true

313
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,240
footage. There it is. Look at the look.

314
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,360
Look at the eyes. They've ever seen me

315
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,680
so happy. Right. But there is an Oz

316
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,600
approved beef burger. The Sal the

317
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,200
Salibarios family has a summer cookout

318
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,120
every year and they say they're the

319
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,079
pickiest burger lovers. And here's what

320
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,399
they say are their complaints or beefs

321
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,519
with most burgers. I just want to taste

322
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,519
good meat. I don't want to wreck my diet

323
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:02,320
with just one burger. I really want a

324
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,920
burger which is not dry like a

325
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,160
cardboard.

326
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,000
I've got the best homemade juicy beef

327
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,920
burger patty right here. It's under 150

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
calories. Butcher Justin DeMarco is

329
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,519
back. Now Justin, he's a butcher. He

330
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,120
knows all this stuff. What kind of meat

331
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,880
goes into a good burger? This stuff

332
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
behind the scenes that we don't all see.

333
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,399
Okay. Okay. So, there's one thing that I

334
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,519
know about and it's burgers. Okay. So,

335
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,959
my inputs start with ribeye skirt steak

336
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,880
which lend themselves to being more of a

337
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,959
fattier kind of meat. Tastes good. in

338
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,040
sirloin and chuck. And as you can see

339
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,560
here, these have less fat. So what you

340
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,320
do is to combine all these wonderful

341
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,839
meats together. Set them through the

342
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,120
grinder. We'll add a couple more pieces

343
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,360
here. Give a little push on it. And as

344
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
you can see, some of that meat's coming

345
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,160
right out. And there you go. You have a

346
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
fresh burger. All right. So it looks

347
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,720
like this. The typical size of burger

348
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,480
should be what? Trends have gone from 8

349
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,000
ounces and now have decreased down to

350
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,279
like four to 6 ounces. And I think it

351
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,959
has to do with, you know, the

352
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,800
cholesterol and the fat and that's in

353
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,399
these burgers. It tastes so darn good.

354
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,079
It's good enough. But you don't need

355
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,920
four scoops of ice cream. One or two

356
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,519
scoops can most of us can be okay with.

357
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,279
After that, hedonism. All right. How

358
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,720
about the pre-formed patties that we see

359
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,480
everywhere? Now, these are Yeah, these

360
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,600
are they're fresh, but they're frozen.

361
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Correct. So, there's two there's two

362
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,040
kinds. There's a fresh burger patty and

363
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
a frozen. If you have to buy a frozen

364
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,720
burger, obviously you want to look for a

365
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,560
burger that has beef as your primary

366
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,959
ingredient. Anything after that, any

367
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,120
preservatives or salts or or artificial

368
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,240
flavorings, it's just not the best

369
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,920
thing. And how about the these

370
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,600
pre-formed fresh? Are they okay? Same

371
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,040
thing. Obviously, beef is a primary

372
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,200
ingredient. You want to look for a

373
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
burger that's 4 to 6 ounces. And also

374
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,720
not so pressed. If the burger is

375
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,839
pressed, when you put it on the grill,

376
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,160
it tends to release a lot of the

377
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,560
flavors. And the sell by date. Sell by

378
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
date is 3 days prior and then a day or

379
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,279
two after purchasing them is the best

380
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,560
time to use them. All right, come on

381
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,639
over here. We have a cook, a studio

382
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,880
cookout ready for the ultimate beef

383
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,000
burger reveal. The Caliberios family is

384
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,519
here. They consider themselves the

385
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,839
piggiest burger lovers. You heard them

386
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,200
earlier. Remember, beef burgers are not

387
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,959
a daily food. But if you're going to

388
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,720
indulge, I want you to choose Wisy. So,

389
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,440
it is time for the big moment. Ready?

390
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,399
Drum roll,

391
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,720
please. For the first time ever, I

392
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,480
present the ground beef and chopped

393
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,200
mushroom mashup burger. Please. The

394
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,800
Salario family is eating tasty. Please

395
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,000
give us get a start here. We're going to

396
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,680
see what they think. They're the

397
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,720
experts. Justin, first off, why would

398
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,560
you com combine mushrooms and beef?

399
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,760
Well, one, it's a good binder. And like

400
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,079
a lot of mushrooms, for example, the

401
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,760
porttoella has a meteor kind of flavor.

402
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,000
So combining the two and the moisture

403
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,480
from the from the mushroom really makes

404
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,600
for a nice flavorful hamburger. Let's

405
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
talk about beef for a second, everybody.

406
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,320
Right. You ought to be buying the

407
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,360
perfect beef burger ingredients, right?

408
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,360
Make sure it's 100% grass-fed ground

409
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,959
organic beef. That's what you want. I

410
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,399
like the ground chuck. It's got about 15

411
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,320
20% fat compared to 25 to 30% in regular

412
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,079
ground beef. That's a good balance,

413
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,600
guys, between flavor and fat if you do

414
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,040
that. So, how do you make the mashup?

415
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,120
How do you bring the mushrooms and marry

416
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,399
them into the beef? It's super easy.

417
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,760
It's like making peanut butter and

418
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,079
jelly, right? You take a nice pound of

419
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,079
chop meat, dice up some nice mushrooms,

420
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,920
whatever you like, and then you add some

421
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,880
nice herbs. You could do some margarm,

422
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,639
you could do some some rosemary, garlic,

423
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,480
and there you go. Nice flavorful burger.

424
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,320
So, before I get your opinion on taste,

425
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,680
let me give you the numbers. A regular

426
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,399
beef burger like like Well, not like

427
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
this one, like the one you would

428
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,240
normally would have gotten about 350

429
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,519
calories. Okay. Lot of calories. It's

430
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,279
good. Tastes great, but a lot of

431
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,519
calories. The ground beef and mushroom

432
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:26,160
mashup burger that we revealed today has

433
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:28,000
a total of 147 calories, less than half.

434
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,760
Let's see what the Salario family thinks

435
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
of the taste. Will it live up to their

436
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,519
beef burger expectations? So, take it

437
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
away. Let's get the kids in there first.

438
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,199
What do you guys think? Oh, Mr. Dr. H.

439
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,240
Sorry, Dr. Okay, Mr. Doctor's fine. It

440
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:46,639
is so good. It's not It's not dry. It's

441
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,360
not dry like a piece of cardboard. And

442
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,000
it's not hard like a p like a hockey

443
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,240
puck. It cuz I just get I just grew

444
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,240
these teeth.

445
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,399
You have passed. You have passed my

446
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,839
flavor test. It's I passed a girl. Look

447
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,160
at that one. Never mind. I like that.

448
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
What do you think? I mean, when I first

449
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
saw this burger, I was like, "This is

450
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,959
really appetizing." And then I tried it

451
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,519
and it was just went above and beyond.

452
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,760
It's like really seasoned well and I

453
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,360
really like it. I also like mushrooms.

454
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,720
We should go into business together. And

455
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
we got our testimonials right here. What

456
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,760
do you think? It It literally checks off

457
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,760
all my boxes to have it be healthy,

458
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,000
delicious, low calories. I don't have to

459
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,480
feel guilty about having a burger. This

460
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,480
is a cookout classic. No doubt. I think

461
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,320
you said it right. There's some taste

462
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
that belong together, right? Peanut

463
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,360
butter and chocolate go together. Peanut

464
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,880
butter and jelly go together. I couldn't

465
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,639
add peanut butter to to beef. Maybe we

466
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,920
should try that next. But mushrooms and

467
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,600
burgers, they go to well. We put the

468
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,279

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,560
doubling up. They are wearing one pair

493
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,320
of shapewear on top of another.

494
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,920
Celebrities like Gail King, Kim

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,839
Kardashian, and even Beyonce admitting

496
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,320
to this two at a time trick to get an

497
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,920
extra slimming effect. I'm guilty of it

498
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,079
too right now. But the question

499
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,920
absolutely, Dr. Oz, but the question is,

500
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,440
what's the cost? Yeah. Who else out

501
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,759
there is doubling up? Let me see. Show

502
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,679
hands. Any other sewear secrets? Oh,

503
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,120
here we go. How are you? We got two two

504
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
victims right here. How are you? How you

505
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,480
doing? What's your first name? My name's

506
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,160
Christine. Christine, nice to meet you.

507
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,720
You You feel good the way you are now?

508
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,559
Yes. Well, got to tuck in a little bit.

509
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
Tilt this way. Babe, why do you double

510
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,240
up? Bring it home for me. Hey, if it

511
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,439
works for Beyonce, it works for me. It's

512
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,919
pretty good reason. She does look good

513
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,439
in those photos.

514
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,600
And Christie, how long you been wearing

515
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,799
the doubled up version of shapewear? Oh,

516
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,280
a couple of months. Once I found out

517
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,400
about it. Before it was just one and

518
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,000
that was it. But when I heard about

519
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,440
doubling up twice, I was like, that's

520
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,240
for me. And what does it feel like when

521
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,080
you're wearing it? Oh, it's

522
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,840
uncomfortable. It's tight. It's the

523
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,200
worst. But it looks good. So paint is

524
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,280
beauty. That's all that

525
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,480
matters. H h how how many hours do you

526
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,240
generally wear your doubled up

527
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
shapewear? Depends what I where I'm

528
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,120
where I'm going. But honestly, I would

529
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,320
say at least like 5 hours. Five hours.

530
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,000
All right. So here's the deal. It's

531
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,160
going first covered the first lie about

532
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,919
shapewear that the pain is worth it. It

533
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,840
was funny, but is it true? While

534
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,440
shapewear may make you look good on the

535
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,760
outside, we wanted to investigate the

536
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,440
truth about how you feel on the inside

537
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,760
after using the shapewear double up

538
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,160
method. So Mara, God bless her, did a

539
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,080
12-hour shapewear experiment wearing two

540
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,840
pairs. There's a difference, right?

541
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,080
There's her baseline, the two pairs. I

542
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,919
mean, what we uncovered might shock you.

543
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,840
Take a

544
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,240
look. Shapewear has become a way of

545
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,559
life, offering the hope of form fitting

546
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,799
us into our favorite outfits. The

547
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,679
promise to flatten tummies and smooth

548
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,240
out lumps, making us look and feel our

549
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,120
best. Now, some are going as far as to

550
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,240
wear one body shaper on top of another

551
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,720
one to increase the effect. Recently,

552
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,679
Kim Kardashian revealing she'll wear two

553
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,760
pairs when she feels

554
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:50,080
heavier. But is there a downside to

555
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,200
doubling up? To find out, I'm going to

556
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,960
wear two body shapers at the same time

557
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,080
to find out what happens throughout the

558
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,960
day. I just heading out for the day. Um,

559
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,919
definitely feels really snug. So, it's

560
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,080
been a few hours now and I ate breakfast

561
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,760
and I'm drinking tea and I've been

562
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,720
sitting. Now, it's really starting to

563
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,440
get uncomfortable. It's like digging

564
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,120
into my sides. I made a mistake of

565
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,200
getting Celzer water, which I always

566
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,320
get, but the bubbles are making my

567
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,559
stomach really hurt in this double

568
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,360
shapewear. They keep rolling down on the

569
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,760
side and it's like impossible to pull up

570
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,480
because they're under my clothes. I am

571
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,039
dying to take this shapewear off. It is

572
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,200
killing me. But I still have 2 hours

573
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,679
left in this experiment. I'm eating my

574
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,480
dinner standing up because it hurts to

575
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,000
sit down at this point. Next, I wanted

576
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,240
to see how wearing shapewear was

577
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,559
affecting my breathing. So, I'm visiting

578
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,440
Dr. Sandra Galbard who'll conduct a

579
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,919
series of lung function tests.

580
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm going to have you take a really,

581
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,760
really, really deep breath in. You can

582
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,360
sit forward. Absolutely. Okay, for the

583
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,360
first test, I'm not wearing any

584
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,280
shapewear. And breathe out. 6 seconds.

585
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,440
Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Out. Keep

586
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,919
going. And breathe in. Excellent. Okay.

587
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,919
Then I wear two pairs of shapewear for

588
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,360
comparison. Let's see now that you're

589
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,960
wearing two body shapewear garments if

590
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,200
you're more restricted with your

591
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,840
airflow. Okay. I can tell you it

592
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,160
definitely feels like I can't breathe as

593
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,919
well. Right

594
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:27,360
now, keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

595
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,679
And deep breath in. Excellent.

596
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,760
Dr. Galbard looks over the test results

597
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,120
and you won't believe what she found.

598
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,520
All right, it's time for the results of

599
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,679
Mara's breath test. Dr. Sandy Gellbart

600
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,919
joins us now. So, we just saw you test

601
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,600
Mara's lungs. She breathed out for six

602
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,919
seconds. Yeah. The best she could

603
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,280
possibly do before and after with the

604
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,039
with the doubling up of the shapeware.

605
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,880
What did you find? There was more than

606
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,280
half a liter decrease in the amount of

607
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,960
air she was able to do breathe out when

608
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,039
she was wearing the shapewear. And this

609
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,159
half a liter. Yeah. Really statistically

610
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,520
significant. So here we have the

611
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,640
baseline without the shapewear. You

612
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,960
know, it's over three liters and the

613
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,799
drops under of it's a huge difference.

614
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,280
What's it like, Mara, seeing that? To

615
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,400
me, it's it's worth it. You know, the

616
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,240
difference is so big. It's not my chief

617
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,840
correspondence here. Like my partner is

618
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,159
telling me she'd rather give up a couple

619
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,559
years of healthy life to but you look

620
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
marvelous because I feel so confident in

621
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,840
it that you know it's worth that

622
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,640
sacrifice. Maybe cuz I love you so much.

623
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,760
I'll just show you a little

624
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,400
demonstration of what's happening in

625
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,600
your body. This maybe might compel you.

626
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600
This is what you're all doing when you

627
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,960
put shapewear on. Right. So normally

628
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
everyone take a deep breath. Everyone do

629
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,120
take a deep breath in. Right. What

630
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,960
happens is your chest expands. Right?

631
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,200
The lungs fill with air when the chest

632
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,640
expands. But when you put the shapewear

633
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,799
on, right? Let's put the shapewware on

634
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,720
this little Oh, look at it. It squeezes

635
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,640
everything. Right now, it restricts your

636
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,760
chest expansion. Therefore, you cannot

637
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,360
pull air into your lungs, making it

638
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,600
difficult for you to breathe, right? It

639
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,360
makes you feel lightheaded, tired, you

640
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,960
get anxious. So, let's go over this

641
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,280
again. Mar's lung function decreased by

642
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,720
more than half a liter. That's a lot.

643
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,240
Much more than I expected, by the way.

644
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,080
That's beyond what you'd expect in

645
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,440
between a person in the morning and the

646
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,679
afternoon, right?

647
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,360
way more than you'd expect between right

648
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,280
we see that in situations where people

649
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,720
are pregnant if they have scoliosis

650
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,240
wherever you're restricting the chest

651
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,840
wall or the rib cage so this was a big

652
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,679
finding and that was just you just had

653
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,840
it on for one day for one day and I do

654
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,360
this regularly the next slide about

655
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,960
shaper I want to cover is that you guys

656
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,039
are always telling yourselves squeezing

657
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,039
into a smaller size makes you

658
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,120
skinnier you've admitted to me that many

659
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
people I won't mention any names have

660
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,799
actually used the extra slim version by

661
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,720
making getting a size that they couldn't

662
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,080
possibly fit into. It has the opposite

663
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,840
effect. You are Yeah. You get an intent

664
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,240
you intentionally get a smaller size

665
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,760
because it makes you even smaller. When

666
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,159
you wear this over time, you're actually

667
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,760
weakening your core muscles. So, you're

668
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,120
you could be making your stomach look

669
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,799
worse. So, the bottom line is you're not

670
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,320
gaming the system. You're not getting

671
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,360
slimmer. You're just kind of putting a

672
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,200
band-aid on. Can you help me with

673
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,200
something? Where does the flab actually

674
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,120
go? All right. So, that's a very good

675
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,559
question. You're squeezing it like like

676
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,000
a toothpaste tube. Where does it go?

677
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,760
Yeah. So you're put you're compressing

678
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,440
it like if you were to push your stomach

679
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,640
in with your hands. I'm actually getting

680
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,320
short of breath right now because I'm

681
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,440
pushing even more on this. But what ends

682
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,200
up happening a lot of times is that it

683
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,840
gets pushed up and that's where you get

684
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,400
that dreaded roll over. And so all day

685
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,520
we're basically fighting to pull this

686
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,600
shapewear back up because the the fat is

687
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,039
trying to be free. All right, time to

688
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,600
go. It's free at last. Free at last.

689
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,520
Thank god

690
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,799
nobody go. Interestingly, despite the

691
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,159
fact you're an expert in this area, you

692
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,520
actually wear shapewear yourself. So,

693
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,120
you must have some hack, some

694
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,159
prescription for wearing it without

695
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,159
causing pain or other bodily harm. Yeah.

696
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,919
So, the first and foremost is wear the

697
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,000
right size. If you're a medium, don't

698
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,919
grab a small. Wear it for a limited

699
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,760
amount of time. Don't wear it days on

700
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,720
end. Sleeping in it, that's going to

701
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,159
lead to bad results down the line. I

702
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,080
understand the allore of wearing these

703
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,480
garments, but you have to wear them the

704
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,960
way they were intended to be worn. If

705
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,520
you're going to be squeezing into a

706
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,880
really tight shapewear, you may look

707
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,799
better, but down the line, you're going

708
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,640
to feel worse. So, the key question that

709
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,960
I'm taking away from this is the right

710
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,640
shapewear. So, up next, the at home

711
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,640
test. There are two of them to detect if

712
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,279
your shapewear is the right size for

713
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,270
you. You want to see this? Thank you

714
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,559
very much.

716
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,400
I love getting to talk with you on my

717
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,559
show every single day. But when the

718
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,880
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

719
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,960
is not over. I still have a lot that I

720
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,760
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

721
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,400
Oz podcast on Apple Podcast or wherever

722
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,400
you get your

723
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:44,960
podcast. Today, the biggest lies you

724
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,840
tell yourself about shapewear. You ever

725
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,679
get the dreaded roll over, right? or the

726
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,840
indentations in your skin from trying to

727
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,840
squeeze into your shapewear. We're back

728
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,240
with the two self tests to detect if

729
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,320
your shapewear is right for you. Fashion

730
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,360
expert Denise Cowwell is here. She says

731
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,159
there's a science to shapewear. Why is

732
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,480
that? Well, unlike a blouse or a dress,

733
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,720
Dr. Oz, your body shaper should actually

734
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,720
fit tight, but sometimes people don't

735
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,880
know the difference between too tight

736
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,279
and tight enough just to do the trick.

737
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,600
You want it to be cinched and secure,

738
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,200
but not where you can't breathe or move.

739
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,640
So, we just uncovered the two tests to

740
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,640
make sure your shapewear isn't too

741
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,559
tight. Shapeware fanatics Teresa and

742
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,240
Ivana are here to try them out. Thank

743
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,159
you for sharing the experience with the

744
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,679
entire audience. You're going to judge

745
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,200
how these tests work on you and we'll

746
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,679
all learn from that. All right. The

747
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,760
first test, the waist twist to prevent

748
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,679
shapewear rollover. Explain how it's

749
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,080
done. So, after you put your shapewear

750
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,720
on, you actually just want to move to

751
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,640
the side. Move to the side. You can even

752
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,120
go to the side this way, too. But you're

753
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,679
twisting your body. And then if your

754
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,320
shapewear starts to kind of dig and cut

755
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,480
into your skin or if you feel like it's

756
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,279
rolling down or bulging just a little

757
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,520
bit in back, you need to go up a size.

758
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,880
Got it. Got to go up a size. Three, but

759
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,799
it's not too tight. Does it feel okay

760
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,320
for you guys? Mine's a little tight. It

761
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,679
is on the side. It's a little tight. So,

762
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,760
I think I would definitely have to go up

763
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,200
a size. Go up a size. So, we got at

764
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,520
least a self check. Come on over here.

765
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,400
Second big test is it's called the leg

766
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,400
check to avoid skin indentations. So

767
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,760
Denise, I I'll stand, you guys sit and

768
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600
demonstrate and explain. Yes. So

769
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,760
basically ladies, we're going to sit and

770
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,360
we're going to cross our legs just like

771
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,600
ladylike if you can cross all the way

772
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,159
over or just to your ankles. But the

773
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,600
thing here is you'll feel that band. We

774
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
all know sometimes our shapewear has

775
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,320
that band right here. If you feel that

776
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,240
band start to dig into your skin or it's

777
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,760
even causing an indentation in your

778
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,840
skirt and something that you don't

779
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,919
really want, then you should get a

780
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,120
bigger size. How's your shapewear feel

781
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,960
with this second test? Is it digging

782
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,120
into your thighs? Mine's good. Mine's

783
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,120
good. Perfect. So, it's just the waist

784
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,640
part. Just the waist. So, if it's if

785
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,080
it's dig How about if one you pass one

786
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,440
but not the other? Well, they have so

787
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,720
many different types of shapewear. They

788
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,000
have them where they're shorts. They

789
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,760
have them a little bit longer like I was

790
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,760
talking about the you have you can have

791
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,520
some that stop right at the waist or

792
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,799
some that are higher up. So there's

793
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,799
different ones and then they have ones

794
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,400
with straps. So you kind of have to have

795
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,640
an arsenal of shapewear in your

796
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,080

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,600
memory boosters and brain games being

802
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,360
pushed online. Can they really help

803
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,440
optimize your brain's cognitive

804
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,000

807
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,520
out. We are stopping scammers in their

808
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,960
tracks before they get to you and your

809
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,039
family. Now, whether it's a game, an

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,960
app, or a pill, everywhere you click

811
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,960
online, someone is trying to sell you

812
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,960
another memory booster, and you're

813
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,880
buying them. Sales are in the millions,

814
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,840
and they're climbing every day. But, do

815
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,679
brain boosters really work? And are they

816
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,120
safe? Trisha from our audience is here.

817
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,720
Thank you for playing this little game

818
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,120
with us. How's your memory, you think?

819
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,200
Not good. Not good. No, not at all. I'm

820
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,520
a busy mom and I'm always multitasking

821
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,919
and I'm trying to, you know, do grocery

822
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,600
shopping and just doesn't work. How many

823
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,760
kids do you have? I have two kids. You

824
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,200
sure? You remember that, right? Yes. See

825
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,799
how bad it is. All right. So, ready to

826
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,880
test your memory? Yes. All right. So, I

827
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,000
showed you a card before the show.

828
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,440
There's some pictures on the card,

829
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,039
right? All right. I'm going to ask you

830
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
some details about those pictures. to

831
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,159
see how much of the detail you remember.

832
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
Okay, first question. All right,

833
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,240
everyone at home, you can see the card

834
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,760
right now. It's in front of you, but

835
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,679
we're not showing it to you. Okay. All

836
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,399
right. What color was the flower?

837
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,000
Yellow. What time was the clock set to?

838
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,520
Oh,

839
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,600
3:00. 3:00. Do you remember? No, I

840
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,039
didn't think so.

841
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,000
What was the finger pointing away from?

842
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,320
Um, the to the right of the hamburger.

843
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,720
Oh my goodness. That's good. What color

844
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,760
was the dog? Brown.

845
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,279
You know what? I want to bring in the

846
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,320
author of the Alzheimer solution, Dr.

847
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:59,919
Ali Alisher Sarzi. Dr. Sai, come on over

848
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,919
here. Hi. That was pretty good. That was

849
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,000
really good. You did very well.

850
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,440
Absolutely. Now, you say memory lapses

851
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,559
are normal. I mean, how do we know

852
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,880
what's normal and how do we improve on

853
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,559
it? You know, memory lapses, you know, a

854
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,320
few of them are okay. And especially for

855
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,000
you, I'm a mom. I understand you have

856
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,679
kids. You have a lot of things to take

857
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,200
care of. And multitasking, you know,

858
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,840
there's no such thing as multitasking.

859
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,840
It's doing multiple things badly. Uh but

860
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,600
you know they're of no concern. Um the

861
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,799
brain is a very complex organ and

862
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,399
there's so many ways you can actually

863
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,159
make it healthier. Getting half of them

864
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,720
right which is what you got. Yes. That's

865
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,520
that's that's okay. Yes. Absolutely. And

866
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,840
a lot of memory is affected by focus and

867
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,000
attention. You know um focus is actually

868
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,919
the gateway to memory. And there's so

869
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,840
many things you can do to improve your

870
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,120
attention and focus. Right? So you're

871
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,559
going to move from knowing there's a

872
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,320
clock to knowing what time the clock

873
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,679
was. Right? Knowing there was a dog to

874
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,720
the right color. Okay. Thank you very

875
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,440
much Trisha. Pay attention. It's

876
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,080
important. Becca Sherzai, who is using

877
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,880
these online memory boosters and what do

878
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,720
they claim they do? A lot of people, a

879
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,320
lot of smart people are using these

880
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,080
memory boosters. Um, college students,

881
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,799
entrepreneurs, athletes, and a lot of

882
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,039
baby boomers and elderly people who are

883
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,440
afraid of going down the path of

884
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,880
cognitive decline, Alzheimer's, dementia

885
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,240
are using these. All right, let's get

886
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,240
into the investigation about whether the

887
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,600
memory boosters are legit or a scam.

888
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,159
First, we're going to look at these

889
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,919
memory pills. What specific pills are we

890
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,320
talking about? So, we're talking about

891
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,240
the types of pills that people can order

892
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,559
online, and you can find them over-

893
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,480
theounter at differentarmacies, in

894
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,039
health stores. They come in the form of

895
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,960
pills, capsules, syrups, etc. These are

896
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,640
over the counter. What's really in these

897
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,840
pills? And you broke it out for us here.

898
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,440
Right. So, I'm glad that we're

899
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,200
explaining all of this. It's a it's a

900
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,880
combination. It could be one compound or

901
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,880
it could be a concoction of different

902
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,440
things together. So, you know, they

903
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,520
might have vitamins like vitamin B12 or

904
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,919
which is the same thing as

905
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,279
cyanocobalamine or vitamin B5, B6, um

906
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,720
thamine, but they'll put all the names

907
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,799
there. It makes it sound legit. These

908
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,880
vitamins do have a role by the way, not

909
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,399
in everybody, but in some people. So,

910
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,240
there's the vitamins. And then, and then

911
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,159
we have chemicals. We have chemicals

912
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,919
like Larginine, which is a non-essential

913
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,159
amino acid, and it has been implicated

914
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,559
in many different brain diseases. Um,

915
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,559
and then the other category is, you

916
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,000
know, herbs and foods. So things like

917
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,000
mushrooms, you know, mushrooms are

918
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,679
incredible and there are extracts of

919
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,480
mushroom including it. We have black

920
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,320
pepper, we have green tea or uh coffee

921
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,760
extract and then different types of

922
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,279
foods and herbs like menthol,

923
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,039
ginokaloba, caffeine. You know, a lot of

924
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,640
these memory pills are just dressed up

925
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,240
caffeine pills and that's why when

926
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,840
people take them, they initially get a

927
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,760
boost of energy. They think, "Wow, I

928
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,919
feel really good." But you know, it can

929
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,600
affect you negatively in so many ways.

930
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,279
We know what caffeine does to our sleep

931
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,080
patterns and we know how important sleep

932
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,080
is for memory. Right? So some pour of

933
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,360
these some combination is used. They're

934
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,120
all different obviously but let's go

935
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,519
inside the body to see how they're

936
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,720
supposed to work in theory. Now these

937
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,159
pills are all different. We just told

938
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,480
you a bunch of different things that

939
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,080
might be in them but generally when you

940
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,679
look inside this is what they're

941
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,360
supposed to be able to do to your body

942
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,279
in theory. Now they say these memory

943
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,279
pills can help with circulation right?

944
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,039
So that actually changes the oxygenation

945
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,240
of the blood. oxidation of blood goes up

946
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,320
into your brain. So your brain has more

947
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,480
of that oxygen. Theoretically that might

948
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,799
be beneficial. Some also claim to change

949
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,840
brain waves. Now brain waves are

950
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,440
interesting. There are certain brain

951
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,600
wave frequencies. It can shift your

952
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,799
cognitive state, right? This can be

953
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,000
something that puts you in a deep sense

954
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,760
of calm, right? Or highly focused place.

955
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,919
So you can concentrate. That's like

956
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,919
classic caffeine effect, right? And then

957
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,360
when it comes to older individuals,

958
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,360
right, these memory pills claim to

959
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,519
enhance communication and cognitive

960
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,080
abilities, right? So, lots of things

961
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,240
they potentially could do. Dr. You spend

962
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,919
a lot of time trying to figure out what

963
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,360
makes sense. When you study the brain,

964
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,960
you learn about things that work and

965
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,360
don't work. Are you concerned about

966
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,039
these? I am, and I'm so happy that we're

967
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,080
talking about this. So, your best

968
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,640
recommendation when it comes to

969
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,399
purchasing memory pills online. I think

970
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,279
it's very important for people to be

971
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,120
cautious. Now, if there are specific

972
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,279
factors that have been studied and it's

973
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,519
backed up by research and your physician

974
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,279
or doctor recommends it, then go for it.

975
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,640
But you have to be careful because a lot

976
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,720
of them have, you know, um compounds or

977
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,039
things that haven't really been studied.

978
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,760
They even found trace heavy metals in

979
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,320
some of these uh memory pills, you know,

980
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,000
and they could be very dangerous and

981
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,840
people actually can suffer from the side

982
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,159
effects of these uh compounds, you know,

983
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,840
having things like gall stone,

984
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:26,960
pancreatitis, kidney stones, etc. So, be

985
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,399
very very careful. If you're thinking

986
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,399
about pursing memory pills, you want to

987
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,720
look for the ingredients Hupersia or

988
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,559
Bakopa. Those two have been found to aid

989
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,320
in brain function to some degree. So at

990
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,720
least don't waste your money. Next, we

991
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,000
investigated games to help the brain

992
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,919
because these brain games have gotten

993
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,360
super popular. This, by the way, is what

994
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,880
it looks like when I talk to my kids. I

995
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,720
see the tops of their heads. So I see

996
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,000
the top head, top head, top head. How

997
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,120
many of you are you all living the same

998
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,360
life I am? So there's been a surge of

999
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,799
recent brain training apps that have

1000
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,360
gone out there. They're all over the

1001
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,440
place. Every smartphone user out there

1002
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,960
uh has brain training games. The

1003
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,360
question is do they have any real

1004
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,440
cognitive benefit? So there are some

1005
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,120
brain gains and they have been studied

1006
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,720
and they have been able to show

1007
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,480
scientists have been able to show that

1008
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,399
participating in those brain games can

1009
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
be helpful. But then on the same side

1010
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,440
there's a lot of controversial data

1011
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,040
showing that you know all of these games

1012
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,040
don't really affect anything and it

1013
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,839
doesn't really affect successful

1014
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,280
cognitive aging per se. All right so

1015
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,399
here's the bottom line everybody. If you

1016
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,000
like the brain games is a way to

1017
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,159
de-stress. I'm fine with that. Just set

1018
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,119
a screen limit, time limit so you're not

1019
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,399
dealing with all this that I'm dealing

1020
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,240
with right now. People aren't paying

1021
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,679
attention otherwise. Memory pills, brain

1022
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,200
games, they're not the only things to

1023
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,359
get your memory in check. When we come

1024
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,119
back, investigate some natural ways for

1025
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:43,620
you to boost your memory with items you

1026
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,159
have right at home. So stick around.

1027
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,879
[Applause]

1028
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,159
Drink up. We've got an Oz approved 3-day

1029
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,720
tea. We took all of the best teas and we

1030
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,480
combined them with food. Get results

1031
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,680
safely without feeling hungry. Next, Oz.

1032
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,840
That's coming up on

1033
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,840
[Music]

1034
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,839
Wednesday. We were talking about memory

1035
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,920
boosters and brain games are being

1036
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,000
pushed online. Now, Chef Nikki Dinky,

1037
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,599
author of Meat on the Side, has some

1038
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,599
natural memory boosting recipes you're

1039
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,760
all going to love. The first natural

1040
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,760
memory boosting recipe is golden milk

1041
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,599
overnight oats. I've heard of golden

1042
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,680
milk and heard of overnight oats, but

1043
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,280
only you could put them together. Well,

1044
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,440
I've been loving this idea of overnight

1045
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,119
oats. Um, it's been very trendy.

1046
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,040
Recently, I've been doing this golden

1047
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,520
milk latte thing, which is basically

1048
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,280
just a nutmilk combined with some ginger

1049
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,119
and turmeric and all these warm, just

1050
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,720
delicious spices. So, then I thought,

1051
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,119
why not just put them all together, make

1052
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,800
it super easy and super nutritious, and

1053
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,320
thus we have our golden milk overnight

1054
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,160
oats. As a neurologist, thoughts,

1055
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,280
lectures, there's turmeric in the oats

1056
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,880
now, right? The oats potentially

1057
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,440
beneficial for the for brain function.

1058
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,359
Yes. F first of all genius combining

1059
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,760
both of them together and then my

1060
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,920
goodness um I mean turmeric it's a

1061
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,240
potent anti-inflammatory and it actually

1062
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,560
binds to the bad protein amaloid that is

1063
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,480
involved in Alzheimer's disease and gets

1064
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,839
rid of it. So put both of these

1065
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,520
together. Is it true they have less

1066
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,040
Alzheimer's in India? Maybe because of

1067
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,640
the turmeric the curry sauce that they

1068
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,079
they eat. There is there's a perspective

1069
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,520
there. Yes. Because of the curries that

1070
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,040
they eat and they combine it with

1071
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,040
different kinds of spices. So you get

1072
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,640
anti-inflammatory effects of all of

1073
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,680
these different spices in your food.

1074
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,880
They make it pretty straightforward. You

1075
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,320
say just you mix it like you normally

1076
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,000
would. Yeah. All this stuff pretty much

1077
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,920
just goes in the jar. Your oats, your

1078
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,760
milk, your ginger, turmeric, cinnamon,

1079
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,280
vanilla, and honey. And you let it sit

1080
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,880
overnight and you have this beautiful,

1081
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,720
super nutritious breakfast. Is this

1082
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,560
chia? Yeah. And I love to top with

1083
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,000
something crunchy like some chia, some

1084
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,680
walnuts, and maybe some fresh

1085
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,200
blueberries just to keep it kind of

1086
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,800
popping. All right, the next natural

1087
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,480
memory booster. You all have these

1088
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,760
things in your homes. Use them, right?

1089
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,680
Doesn't cost you a lot more. It's a

1090
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,079
salad with fish oil dressing. Now, you

1091
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,280
all know fish oils are essential. I

1092
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,359
never thought about putting it in a

1093
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,960
salad dressing before. You know, I used

1094
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,320
to take a lot of this and you know,

1095
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,680
whether it's in a pill, you're putting

1096
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,440
it on a spoon, it's not the most

1097
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,680
pleasant thing. So, I thought, how can I

1098
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,599
get this into our food? And by combining

1099
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,680
it with things like Greek yogurt and

1100
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,079
orange juice and honey, you can really

1101
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,079
make a very delicious salad dressing

1102
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,440
that of course you can use on salmon.

1103
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,920
You could use it as a spread on

1104
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,920
sandwiches. And it's just such a fun

1105
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,599
alternative way to get that fish oil

1106
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,280
into your body. I don't know why I don't

1107
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,880
taste fish oil so much. You know, we're

1108
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,560
using a lemon flavored fish oil, so

1109
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,160
that's already taking out a little bit

1110
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,640
of that fishy taste. And then I think

1111
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,320
the Greek yogurt is key. That just kind

1112
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,160
of mellows it out and makes it something

1113
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,040
that, well, we want to eat. diabolical

1114
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,560
diabolical and it makes sense for the

1115
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,359
brain. Absolutely. It's a synergy

1116
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,960
between the last memory booster where

1117
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,440
we'll have to see if it appeals to your

1118
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,040
taste buds is a shot of beet and ginger

1119
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,280
juice. So, Dr. Sherz, before you take

1120
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:46,079
the shot health benefits, why is it so

1121
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,760
good if you can do it? I love beets and

1122
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,760
beets are an incredible vegetable

1123
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,839
because they are very rich in nitrates

1124
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,800
and so the nitric oxide that you get

1125
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,800
from beets actually expands the arteries

1126
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,720
so you get more blood flow to your

1127
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,280
brain. It's basically like Viagra for

1128
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,119
your brain. It's an amazing thing.

1129
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,599
Quickly, Dicky, quickly. Okay. Okay.

1130
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,359
Okay. All right. I'll toast to you guys.

1131
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,640
Everyone wants Viagra for the brain.

1132
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,079
Audience, you want some Viagra for the

1133
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,920
brain? All right.

1134
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,760
Oh, it's a Oh, it's got some punch to

1135
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,160
it.

1136
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Oh, please. Wow. Don't let me force you.

1137
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,240
You're young. You may never forget this

1138
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,640
shot. Be sure to head over to dr.com for

1139
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,400
my natural memory boosting prescription

1140
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,760
plan. If you remember, we'll be right

1141
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,760
back. What do you think?

1142
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,590
[Music]

1143
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:39,040
Whoa. Many people in my audience have a

1144
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,280
pair of glasses with them right now. May

1145
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,960
I see? Let me see. Oh, I see you. Even

1146
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,160
better like this. Right. All right. So,

1147
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,760
glasses are something we take for

1148
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,880
granted. For those of you like me who

1149
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,560
use them for reading, you can get them

1150
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,839
for just a few bucks. I buy a bunch of

1151
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,960
them, right? Get them at the pharmacy,

1152
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,599
leave them everywhere, so I don't even

1153
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,760
think about them. But what if the world

1154
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,599
looked like this?

1155
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,520
little out of focus, right? And he

1156
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,920
didn't have access to glasses to get it

1157
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,520
back into focus like this. The simple

1158
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,200
things you do every day from reading to

1159
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,599
driving a car to seeing your loved ones

1160
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,160
would become impossible. It's a reality

1161
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,640
for billions. That's right. Billions

1162
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,079
with a B of people all around the world.

1163
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,160
Joining me now are two people who have

1164
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,800
teamed up to help us see the world more

1165
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,240
clearly. Optometrist Dr. Jordan Castelo.

1166
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,040
Welcome, Jordan. Thank you, Dr. and

1167
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,200
Rabbi Jennifer Krauss.

1168
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,880
First off, Dr. Castle, I just described

1169
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,320
the problem as affecting billions. Put

1170
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,160
some numbers, put some meat into this

1171
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,760
thing. Set it up for us. Well, as you

1172
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,640
know, Dr. Oz, vision is our most

1173
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,880
critical sense. 700 years since the

1174
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,400
invention of glasses, most people in the

1175
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,880
world still don't have access to

1176
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,480
glasses. Our research shows that a

1177
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,720
simple pair of glasses can increase

1178
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,320
someone's productivity by 30%. Oh my

1179
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,800
goodness. Increase their educational

1180
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,800
performance and decrease road traffic

1181
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,640
fatalities. Is there road traffic

1182
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,599
fatalities? That's correct. How so?

1183
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,359
Well, 59% of road traffic fatalities

1184
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,200
have a visual component associated with

1185
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,880
them. So, if you can see clearly, you

1186
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,240
can be safer on the road. So, it

1187
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,160
benefits not just you, but the people

1188
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,680
around you then. Absolutely. So, what's

1189
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,359
your vision and why did you get so

1190
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,880
passionate about this? Vision, pardon

1191
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,079
the pun. What do you hope to do? How are

1192
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,320
you going to make a difference? Well, I

1193
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,680
started an organization called

1194
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,359
Visionspring. Our goal is to ensure that

1195
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,760
everyone has access to affordable

1196
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,640
glasses throughout the world. We deliver

1197
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,560
eyeglasses and vision services right to

1198
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,599
people where they live, work, and go to

1199
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,280
school. Last year, we helped over 1.2

1200
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,280
million people get glasses. And

1201
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,359
collectively, over 5 and a half million

1202
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,119
people in the world, Vision Spring has

1203
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,079
provided glasses for over the last

1204
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,599
number of years. Why we're doing this is

1205
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,079
I've always wanted to live a life that

1206
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,760
had a deeper purpose beyond just myself.

1207
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,240
And I discovered that purpose when I was

1208
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,320
a student. I joined a mission to Mexico

1209
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,560
and I met a seven-year-old boy from the

1210
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,240
school for the blind. In fact, though,

1211
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,000
he wasn't blind. All he needed was a

1212
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,920
really strong pair of eyeglasses. And

1213
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,839
when I put the glasses on his face and

1214
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,440
he saw for the first time, it was a

1215
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,760
moment that changed both of our lives. I

1216
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,599
gave him his vision and he gave him and

1217
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,359
he gave me my vision. Oh my goodness.

1218
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,880
And it was just a wonderful moment. And

1219
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,880
it's a way that I can make a difference

1220
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,400
as an eye doctor and we all can make a

1221
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,640
difference as well. Rabbi

1222
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,160
Jen, the benefit of giving is more than

1223
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,440
just acred by the person who gets the

1224
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,520
gift. It actually benefits us

1225
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,160
spiritually, emotionally. How so?

1226
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,119
Absolutely. So there are studies that

1227
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,480
show that when we do something for other

1228
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,720
people with some consistency that we

1229
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,599
sleep better, we're less stressed. We're

1230
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,240
more connected to the people we love. So

1231
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,160
when we do something to heal the world,

1232
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,119
we heal ourselves. Beautifully stated,

1233
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,400
Rabbi Jackson, guys. It's right there.

1234
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,760
This is a great excuse. Pick something

1235
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,280
you want to do. But I tell them like,

1236
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,839
and just to be clear, I checked into

1237
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,520
this. For five bucks, all loaded,

1238
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,720
including the examination and everything

1239
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,079
else, and getting the glass to the

1240
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,680
