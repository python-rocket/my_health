00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,640
Today on Oz, summer health myths busted.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,600
Should you pee on a jellyfish thing?

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,599
You've actually had a little bit of

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,320
personal experience with this. It was so

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,719
painful, Dr. Oz. Will a base tan save

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,279
you from sunburn? Will a bunch of grapes

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,840
help keep mosquitoes away? I have some

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,160
beauty in your next barbecue. Plus, keep

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,240
your lips luscious this summer. A cure

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,199
for cracked dry lips that keeps your

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,000
pucker perfect. Coming up next on Dr.

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,480
Oz.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Hi everybody. Today we are busting the

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,440
biggest summer health myths. Now, first

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,200
I asked lifeguards from coast to coast

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,280
the biggest summer myths they hear

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,040
around the water. I've got a perfect

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,280
person to talk about it. Please welcome

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,850
first place winner, first place of the

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:53,619
National Lifeguard Surf Race, Tom

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,619
[Applause]

23
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,239
O'Neal straight from the competition.

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,199
Yeah. Right out of the water. How do you

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,719
How do you actually win? What do you

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,640
What are you racing? You save people's

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,400
lives. You Well, sort of. We simulate

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,720
saving people's lives. But the race that

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,560
I won is called the uh men's open surf

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,000
race. Uh it was the 2014 USLA National

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,520
Championships which were held in

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Virginia Beach. And it's just a great

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,080
venue for lifeguards to showcase our

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,520
skills and fitness level. They don't

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,720
care about the audience cares about this

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,360
by the way. Oh, sorry. You can talk

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,040
about all those skill stuff. All right.

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,560
So, you know, let's go through this cuz

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,479
you guys know a lot about summer. The

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,840
number one myth that everyone is talking

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,439
about is the one you probably hear at

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,520
the beach or the pool, which is

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,000
absolutely. So, Dr. Oz, the biggest myth

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,280
is waiting 30 minutes after you eat to

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,040
go swimming. That's the number one

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
thing. Parents are yelling at their kids

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
all summer about this. So, who

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,159
perpetuates this myth? Where does it

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,759
come from? Moms and grandmoms. They're

50
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,320
the ones yelling at this at the kids all

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,479
summer long without stop. So, here's the

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,399
deal. Waiting 30 minutes after eating is

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,759
a myth. It's a myth. You can swim

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,280
afterwards. It's not a big deal to go

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,960
swimming. Explain, if you don't mind,

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
what you guys learn in lifeguard school

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
about this myth. Sure. So, in lifeguard

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
training, um, they told us that

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,720
nothing's going to happen. Uh, in my

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,959
experience, nothing has ever happened

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,720
from something like this. In all of my

62
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,959
colleagues experiences, nothing has ever

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,200
happened like this. So, moms, rest

64
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,720
assured, it's okay. Yeah, you might get

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,080
a leg cramp here and there, but it's not

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,239
taking you down. All right. Next thing

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
that a lot of swimmers believe has to do

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,920
with these guys. Look at these folks. Do

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,360
you recognize these things? Oo,

70
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:34,000
jellyfish. And here's the thought. Are

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,920
we better off peeing on a jellyfish?

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,920
Sounds crazy. Denise, please join us.

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Denise, how are you? Hi, Dr. O.

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,440
I would love to hear your story. You've

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,080
actually had a little bit of personal

76
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,879
experience with this concept. I have. My

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,400
husband and I were vacationing in Mexico

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,440
and unbeknownst to me, I was stung by a

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,160
jellyfish. And then it was so painful,

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,640
Dr. Oz, right here on my shin. And my

81
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,159
husband saw an episode of Friends and

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,640
indicated that urinating on the sting

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,000
would obliterate the pain. Yeah. You all

84
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,560
remember that episode of Friends, right?

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,519
This it started a major movement. So, he

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,440
actually peed on your leg.

87
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,640
He did. And you let him pee on your leg.

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,680
And I let him pee on my leg. And it did

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,120
not work at all. It burned. It even

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,200
burned even more. It was It stung. It

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
raised. It was just very, very painful.

92
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,879
Have you gotten them back for this at

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
all? I have. I have. Many, many times.

94
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,720
So, here's the deal. Peeing on a

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,799
jellyfish, my friends, it's a myth. It's

96
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,599
a myth. You know, now you actually know

97
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,599
a little bit about this. You've been

98
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,959
stung. I understand. Yes. Absolutely.

99
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,280
So, would you like to see the jellyfish

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,840
sting? You want to see his sting? Here,

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,120
I'll hold your All right. Thank you. So,

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,120
while I knew this was going to happen,

103
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,120
uh, while competing in Japan on an

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,200
international trip, I was stung by a

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,360
jellyfish and it actually left a a burn

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,920
mark, a scar on my arm. That's Did you

107
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,239
pee on that? No, I didn't. No, I didn't.

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,400
So, what Denise and all the other Here

109
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,840
you use this on your husband this next

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,680
time you try. Absolutely. What did you

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,159
use instead of pee? So, fortunately, the

112
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,159
lifeguards there were equipped uh as we

113
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,200
are here at home. Uh the first thing you

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,799
want to do is you want to get out of the

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,639
water. Immediately get out of the water

116
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,840
and you want to wash the affected area

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,120
off with salt water, warm salt water. Um

118
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,680
that will uh alleviate the pain and

119
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,800
deactivate the stinging cells rather

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,120
than using urine or tap water or fresh

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,280
water that can reactivate the stinging

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
cells. So what do you think people are

123
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,840
saying to you right now about that? What

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,360
was she thinking? I'm getting sweaty

125
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,440
talking about it. Thank you for sharing

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280
your story. Thank you very much, Tom.

127
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,880
Thank you so much. And well, listen, I

128
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,960
want you to pay attention. The inside

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,560
scoop of your favorite summer treat.

130
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,479
One thing we hear a lot from ice cream

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,400
lovers is that they get brain freeze.

132
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,400
Well, guess what? Brain freeze is not a

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,000
myth. It's not your imagination. Even

134
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,680
the brains of Harvard researched and

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,840
found that it's a real thing. What

136
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,680
happens is when the nerves of your top

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,680
touch the cold, your blood vessels

138
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,479
expand and it triggers a pain message in

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,720
your brain. One easy way to avoid this,

140
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,560
warm up the roof of your mouth with your

141
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,800
tongue and you keep eating ice cream all

142
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,800
day long.

143
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,520
I don't know about you, but I thought

144
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,520
that was a pretty cool explanation. You

145
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,199
didn't get it. Cool. Anyway, next hold

146
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,479
up the summer product that you pay for

147
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,680
every year. Let me see it all up there.

148
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,520
What do you guys pay for every single

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,360
year? Yes. Sunscreen. Sunscreen. What's

150
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,440
your first name? Christina. Christina,

151
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,600
come stand if you don't mind. So, here's

152
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,720
the big idea. How long should we keep

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,560
that sunscreen before we toss it? I tend

154
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,039
to toss it every year. Every year. Is

155
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,880
that what you guys sort of do yearly?

156
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,199
Makes sense, right? It's a cream. All

157
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,639
right, everybody. That, my friends, the

158
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
concept of throwing out sunscreen every

159
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,360
year is a myth. Stamp it myth. It's a

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,720
costly myth. So, I want to I want to

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
talk you out of it. Have a seat. You're

162
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
going to enjoy this. Going to save a lot

163
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,360
of money today. Dermatologist Deborah

164
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,960
Watenberg is here. So, why is this a

165
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,759
myth?

166
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,759
So, this is a myth because sunscreens

167
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,360
actually have an expiration date printed

168
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,120
on them and the shelf life of most

169
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,960
sunscreens is two to three years. Did

170
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
you hear that? Two to three years. That

171
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,360
make you mad? It could be yours. So,

172
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,120
sunscreens um are tasted for their

173
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,039
stability. You want to be sure that you

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,720
you store your sunscreen in a safe

175
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,080
environment, not in the back of your car

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,680
for the whole year. Then it's going to

177
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,120
be bad. You want to throw it away. If

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
you leave it next to the heater in your

179
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,520
bathroom, it's not going to be great.

180
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,479
But if you're storing it in a cool, dark

181
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,160
environment through the winter and then

182
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,160
it's still there over the summer, you

183
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,919
can use it. The bigger issue is though,

184
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
you need to use approximately the size

185
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,360
of a shot glass in order to cover your

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,400
body when you are applying an SPF. So

187
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,680
one bottle is around 4 ounces. Some of

188
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,199
them are a little bit bigger, but if

189
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,639
it's 4 ounces, you're only getting

190
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,520
approximately four applications worth of

191
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,840
sunscreen. And as you can see, that's a

192
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,360
lot of sunscreen to apply. So, the

193
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,039
bigger issue for people is to remember

194
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
you need to apply it, you want to apply

195
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,479
it onto your skin before you go

196
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,479
outdoors, at least 20 minutes before

197
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,479
heading outside and you want to apply it

198
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,440
thick so that you get the SPF that's

199
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,919
applied or recognized on the bottle. So,

200
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,759
if you don't get this much used in a

201
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,039
summer, we got a separate issue for you.

202
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,800
Thank you very much for the tip. All

203
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,240
right. Oh, one more question. I hear

204
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,160
about this, but people always say, "I'll

205
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,520
get a pre-tan. I'm just going to get a

206
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,680
little bit of sun, but I won't burn."

207
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,319
And then that smart base tan will

208
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,800
protect my skin. So there is no such

209
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
thing as a healthy base tan. So can we

210
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,000
stamp it with a myth? Is that right?

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,599
Absolutely not. Base tan myth. Not a

212
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,039
smart way. What does it really do? A

213
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,960
base tan gives you a false sense of

214
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,560
security. It makes you think that you

215
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
have a little bit of color and therefore

216
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,720
you can go out. You know, maybe it's the

217
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
equivalent of a sunscreen SPF of a two

218
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,440
or three, but that's nothing. And it's

219
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,639
not healthy for your skin. So it's

220
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
giving you a false sense of security.

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,280
You go outdoors, you burn when you have

222
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,639
a base tan. You also are destroying your

223
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,240
skin. And if you look at the picture

224
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,319
that's on the screen, you can see this

225
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
woman has a base tan, but the damage

226
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,639
that has been done on the right side of

227
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,680
that screen shows that she has

228
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,080
hyperpigmentation, discoloration, and

229
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,440
damage. The damage to those cells is DNA

230
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,280
damage, and the cells are being

231
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,199
destroyed, increased risk for skin

232
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,479
cancer, increased risk for wrinkling,

233
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,080
and aging. And everyone's wearing

234
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,919
sunscreen so that they look young and

235
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,280
they look beautiful. If you do that, you

236
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,639
get a base tan, you're going to look

237
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,000
terrible. Thank you very much. All

238
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,400
right, let me go to Ivory and her

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,759
husband Carrie. They believe the sweeter

240
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,520
your blood, the more bugs will bite you.

241
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,280
How are you, Ivory? I'm good, Dr. Ivy.

242
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,360
Are you wearing ivory? She She's wearing

243
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,120
ivory, too. Yes, I am. So, what gives

244
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
you this belief that it's a it's a

245
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,719
sweetness issue that attracts those

246
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,479
mosquitoes to you? Well, I'm always

247
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,719
getting bit by mosquitoes, Dr. Eyes.

248
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,959
Why? My husband, he's never getting bit.

249
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,360
He says it's because I'm sweet, which

250
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,760
he's a smart man. I a very, very smart

251
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,920
man. But it's very irritating. They bite

252
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
me. It's itchy. It's scratchy. and he

253
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,360
never gets bit. So, I'm going to share

254
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,800
something with you. There a lot of

255
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,320
people think what you're saying is true,

256
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,680
but the thought that you're sweeter and

257
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,080
therefore the mosquitoes like you is

258
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,600
actually a myth. That's not why they're

259
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,519
eating at you. There's another reason

260
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,279
they are. They actually are attracted to

261
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,560
your body odor. Really? Yeah. Think

262
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,320
about that. It's our odor they like.

263
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,200
Carrie, do you think your wife smells

264
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,959
all the time? All the time. No questions

265
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,160
asked. Does she smell good or bad? Good.

266
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,680
Good. She's making sure. Yeah,

267
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,200
absolutely. Of course, he's going to say

268
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,720
that. So, but it's interesting. it.

269
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,399
That's not the smell I'm talking about.

270
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
There's actually a smell that we can't

271
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,320
appreciate that mosquitoes sense. And

272
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,360
when they get that smell, oh, they just

273
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,720
go after it. So besides individual

274
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,320
odors, there are things for example like

275
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,839
mint. So you have a mint jeulip for

276
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
example here. This will attract

277
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,120
mosquitoes to you. They love perfume. So

278
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,560
if you have that might be the

279
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,360
difference. Do you wear perfume? No.

280
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,720
Yeah. Just asking. So perfume

281
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,399
unfortunately women think it's you know

282
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,519
best bad luck when you put perfume on

283
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,720
that smell good for everybody else in

284
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,320
the in the place. You're also smelling

285
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,399
better for the for the mosquitoes and

286
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,839
cheese. Interestingly, you're putting

287
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,200
cheese on something else and just, you

288
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
know, or just cook it and you get on

289
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,320
you. They're going to like that. Okay.

290
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,480
So, you're probably wondering, what am I

291
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,760
going to do about this? Exactly. So,

292
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,600
here's what you're going to do about it.

293
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,440
I have something for you to pack at your

294
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,279
next barbecue. It

295
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:14,160
is grapes. Grapes. Grapes. Oh, here's

296
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,800
why I love grapes so much. It turns out

297
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,880
that mosquitoes detest the smell of

298
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,240
grapes. really they can't stand it. They

299
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,600
run away. You could actually put this

300
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,959
like citronanella around the dinner

301
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
table and it'll help steer those little

302
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,760
things away. And you certainly can smear

303
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,000
it on you a little bit if you get it

304
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,399
wrong. And unfortunately, here's the

305
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,079
only catch. Wine doesn't count, right?

306
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,519
You would think wine will get you there,

307
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,800
but there's something about the sugar in

308
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,680
the wine or something's throwing you. I

309
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,440
don't know what it is, but they don't

310
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,200
like that. But grapes themselves, real

311
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,640
grapes will work because I can go

312
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,360
outside and keep track of everybody

313
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,040
else. You're very swab and debated.

314
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,710
You test your summer mythology with my

315
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,200
quiz on dr.com. I'll be right back.

316
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,760
[Applause]

317
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,399
Coming up, the annual examination that

318
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,720
every woman wants to avoid and doctors

319
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,959
are fighting over it. Some say it could

320
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,920
put your health at risk. Do you still

321
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:08,320
need a yearly pelvic exam? Find out

322
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,959
next. Tomorrow on Dr. Oz, daytime

323
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,240
darling Wendy Williams gets real. The

324
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,079
scale registered a lot. 193 lbs. Does it

325
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,839
affect your self-esteem at all?

326
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,519
Revealing. Has it been a lifelong issue

327
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,360
for you the way? Yes, I come from a

328
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,160
place of fat. My first diet was first

329
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,880
grade and always entertaining. You had a

330
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,320
little work done. Yes, I did. Can you

331
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,750
tell? How her health secrets help you.

332
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,200
That's coming up tomorrow on Dr.

333
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:40,959
[Music]

334
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:44,079
Oz. Friday on Dr. Oz. Touted as safe.

335
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,240
Now, ecigarettes called into question.

336
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,320
Whether you use them or not, why the

337
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,279
smoke-free alternative could be more

338
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,079
dangerous than you think. Plus, how

339
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,279
clean is your hotel room? Dr. Oz

340
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,200
uncovers their dirty secrets. Before you

341
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:06,160
check in, check out Dr.

342
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:08,160
Oz. Oh, that's coming up on Friday.

343
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,920
Today's big conversation is an important

344
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,920
topic for all women, especially in their

345
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,560
30s and 40s, who've had kids and think

346
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,839
they no longer need to go to their

347
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,959
OB/GYN. There is news that says your

348
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,480
yearly pelvic exam is no longer needed.

349
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,240
This recommendation is creating a stir

350
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,800
among doctors and some say it could be

351
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,040
putting your health at risk. OBG Dr.

352
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,440
Lauren Striker is one of them. So, why

353
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,200
are so many OBGN's up in arms over this

354
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,880
report? Well, the American College of

355
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,440
Physicians, who's an organization of

356
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,279
internists, not gynecologists, has

357
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,600
stated that there's no value in an

358
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,680
annual exam unless someone has a very

359
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,959
specific complaint. But no complaint

360
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,200
doesn't mean no problem. So,

361
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,880
gynecologists are really worried that a

362
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,560
lot of very important conditions are

363
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,519
going to get overlooked. And the other

364
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,360
fact is that less than 20% of women

365
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,519
actually go to a gynecologist for an

366
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,279
annual exam. Which means if your family

367
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,839
doctor internist isn't looking in your

368
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,160
vagina, no one's looking in your vagina.

369
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,079
This is not good for women's health.

370
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,519
Pelvic exams, they're an enigma.

371
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,200
Everyone knows the outside part, but

372
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
explain why they're so important to you.

373
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,760
What what actually happens? Well, a lot

374
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,600
of women don't realize how much is

375
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,440
actually happening. And a and a pelvic

376
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,360
exam starts with a very careful

377
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,440
inspection of the outside of the vagina,

378
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,279
the vulva. There may be a vulvar cancer,

379
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,680
precancer. There might be genital warts.

380
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,000
There might be inflammation. There might

381
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,839
be a rash. And then we actually look

382
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,440
inside the vagina at the walls of the

383
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,040
vagina to make sure that there's no

384
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,720
infection, that they're not dried, that

385
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,720
they're not irritated. And then we

386
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,480
inspect the cervix, the opening to the

387
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,560
uterus at the back of the vagina. And

388
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,920
even if it's a non-papsmear year, we

389
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,079
want to know if something's growing

390
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
there that shouldn't be. And then, of

391
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,079
course, the last part of the exam is the

392
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,240
bimmanual exam. When your gynecologist

393
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,560
uses two hands, one inside the vagina

394
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,680
and one on the belly to feel all the

395
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,760
pelvic organs, the uterus, the ovaries,

396
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,519
but even if a woman's had a hyctomy and

397
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,600
doesn't have a uterus, there's other

398
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,519
things in the pelvis. There's bowel,

399
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
there's bladder. We get a lot of

400
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,800
information from this exam. So papsmears

401
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,079
is not the major reason you do a pelvic

402
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,760
exam. No, in fact, it's not the same

403
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,120
thing at all. And that leads to so much

404
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
confusion because a lot of women are

405
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,160
told you don't need a papsmear every

406
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,240
year. And in fact, you don't. But it

407
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,600
doesn't mean that you get a hall pass

408
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,800
because someone's got to look at your

409
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,320
cervix, someone's got to look in your

410
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,399
vagina, and someone has got to feel

411
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,000
those pelvic organs. So, Dr. Sar has

412
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,440
three big concerns with this new report.

413
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,800
The first is that the American College

414
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,440
of Physicians has recommended public

415
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,360
exams are no longer needed for women

416
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,600
without any symptoms who are not

417
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
pregnant. You think that is flawed? This

418
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,399
is really flawed. First of all, it puts

419
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,079
the onus on the woman to know what her

420
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,320
symptoms are or if she even has

421
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,160
symptoms. And very often women do have

422
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,040
symptoms but they're embarrassed. They

423
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,839
don't want to say I have an odor or my

424
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,000
vaginal walls feel a little dry. So they

425
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,360
don't bring it up. The second is is a

426
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,760
lot of women think their symptoms are

427
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,519
just a normal part of aging. It may be

428
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
that they're having painful sex or that

429
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,399
they're losing urine but they think well

430
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm not going to mention that. That

431
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,399
happens to every woman. Or they may not

432
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,920
even know that a symptom is important

433
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,760
like heavy bleeding that's getting

434
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,519
progressively heavier. And then there

435
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,279
are the conditions that have no

436
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,760
symptoms. There are a lot of very

437
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,000
serious conditions, vulvar cancers. I

438
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,839
mean, the list is endless of things that

439
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
have no symptoms until they're at a very

440
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,600
late stage, and that's not when we want

441
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,120
to find these things. Next, the report

442
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,600
says that chances for identifying

443
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,199
ovarian cancer during a public exam is

444
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
low. Is there any evidence really that

445
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,240
you make a big impact on ovarian cancer?

446
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,760
We're in agreement on this one. This is

447
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,760
not what gynecologists are recommending

448
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,519
an annual exam. Unfortunately, we know

449
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,440
that even women that have an annual exam

450
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,920
do not have a lower rate of dying from

451
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,160
ovarian cancer than women who do have

452
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,800
that don't have the annual exam. So,

453
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,920
that's kind of gotten skewed and that

454
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,279
that everyone is saying, well, you're

455
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,800
not going to find ovarian cancer anyway.

456
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,839
Why why bother with the exam? But

457
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,519
there's so many other things we're

458
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,360
looking for. This report also cited that

459
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,720
public exams are painful and

460
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
embarrassing, which I'm sure the

461
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,040
audience can attest to. In fact, before

462
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,680
the show talking about pain, yeah, I

463
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,639
asked on dr eyes.com our audience what

464
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,240
they thought. 68%

465
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,240
the vast majority said that they are

466
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,399
painful. Are you surprised by this?

467
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,160
Well, yes and no. I mean, it it depends

468
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,680
on which part of it is painful. A lot of

469
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,360
women when they say the exam is painful,

470
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,160
they're specifically talking about the

471
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,560
speculum exam. And every woman here is

472
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,399
familiar with what this is a speculum.

473
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,880
And the thing to keep in mind is that

474
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,320
just like shoes, speculum comes in many

475
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,759
different sizes and many different

476
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,759
shapes. And just like every woman

477
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,360
doesn't wear a size seven shoe, every

478
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,120
woman doesn't use the same size

479
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,040
speculum. And too often, if they see a

480
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,040
doctor who might only own one size

481
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,720
speculum, it's going to hurt. Also, if

482
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
the exam is painful, it may be an

483
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,399
indication that there is a problem, that

484
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,839
there's dryness, that there's an

485
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,480
infection, that something is growing

486
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,000
that shouldn't be. I really highly doubt

487
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,320
that most patients who see a

488
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,759
gynecologist annually would report that

489
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,959
it's a painful thing. Here example, this

490
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,079
is, you know, these are two sizes that

491
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,680
are available in the same doctor's

492
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,120
office. The same Mine's much bigger than

493
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,120
yours. That's right. And I probably have

494
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,880
about 30 different sizes. Which one

495
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,320
would you pick? Yeah. You know, everyone

496
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,920
always says to me, I want the small

497
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,040
speculum. Well, why I mean, can they can

498
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
women ask for the small speculum? They

499
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,319
can ask for whatever they want. I'm

500
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,280
going to use the right size, and the

501
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,439
right size is the smallest speculum that

502
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,079
will enable me to do what I need to do.

503
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,600
So, the speculum that I use for a 22y

504
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,600
old who's coming in for birth control

505
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,039
pills and maybe needs an STD screen is

506
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,720
going to be very different than the size

507
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,880
speculum I'm going to use for a

508
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,039
50-year-old who's having heavy bleeding.

509
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,799
So, it really depends and that's why you

510
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,880
need to go to an expert. Then there's

511
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,559
the really big issue, I think, which is

512
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,039
that women are embarrassed. Yeah. Is

513
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,480
that a valid concern? Testicular exams

514
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,919
are embarrassing. Rectal exams are

515
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,039
embarrassing. Nobody would say that

516
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,120
there's no value in those exams. The

517
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,120
problem also from my point of view is

518
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,919
this is once again making these women's

519
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,080
topics taboo. This is humiliating. Don't

520
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,400
go down there. And so what happens is

521
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,320
that women feel even more ashamed when

522
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,720
the doctor says, "You don't need an

523
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,840
exam." And she's thinking, "Ooh, boy. I

524
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,919
guess I should be really kind of

525
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,440
embarrassed about down there. I'm not

526
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,960
going to bring it up." We need to

527
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,799
normalize, not marginalize a pelvic exam

528
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,160
and make women comfortable. So give me

529
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,320
the bottom line. What should everyone

530
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,240
hear from you right now? When you go to

531
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,000
your doctor, he or she doesn't ask if

532
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,760
you'd like your blood pressure checked.

533
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,600
They shouldn't be asking if you'd like a

534
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,080
pelvic exam. This is part of a

535
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,840
comprehensive exam which is better for

536
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,760
women and which women should insist

537
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,039
upon. Dr. Thank you very much. Thanks

538
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,760
for bringing the speculums with you.

539
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,840
Anytime. Right back.

540
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Next, he's traveled the globe in search

541
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,160
of natural ingredients that improve your

542
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,400
health. Now, Dr. Andrew Wild sets a new

543
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,080
course, a map through the market. How to

544
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
find Andrew's healthy treasures in the

545
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,600
aisles of your grocery store. The best

546
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,720
foods for your health. Next, tomorrow on

547
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,000
Dr. Oz, daytime darling Wendy Williams

548
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,080
gets real. The scale registered a lot.

549
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,240
193 lbs. Does it affect your self-esteem

550
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
at all? Revealing. Has it been a

551
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
lifelong issue for you? The weight? Yes.

552
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,760
I come from a place of fat. My first

553
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,440
diet was first grade and always

554
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,960
entertaining. You had a little work

555
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,840
done. Yes, I did. Can you tell how her

556
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,680
health secrets help you? That's coming

557
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,190
up tomorrow on Dr.

558
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,060
[Music]

559
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,720
[Applause]

560
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,480
[Music]

561
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,240
Oz. Dr. Andrew Wallace traveled around

562
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,160
the world searching for the best natural

563
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,240
ingredients to heal you and improve your

564
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,640
health. But today, for the first time,

565
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,640
he's going aisle by aisle to give you

566
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,360
his ultimate grocery store guide. Please

567
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,480
welcome my friend, Dr. Andrew While.

568
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,320
So I want to be clear about this. You

569
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,640
say we can harvest the healing powers of

570
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,080
foods in a grocery store and on a

571
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,000
budget. You don't have to have tons of

572
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,360
money to do this. Absolutely. I mean the

573
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,360
most expensive things in the grocery

574
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,799
store are meats and animal foods and you

575
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,320
can reduce the percentage of those in

576
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,480
the diet. And then vegetables which are

577
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,919
terrific power nutritional powerhouses.

578
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,840
Most of them are quite cheap and there

579
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,039
ways to get even less expensive. Let's

580
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,480
start with the frozen aisle which is a

581
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,679
good example. We've talked a lot about

582
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,520
frozen foods, which I think are

583
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,720
fantastic option. Uh, and a lot of

584
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,000
people don't really believe us. I wanted

585
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,760
to bring the guru in to tell us about

586
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,200
this. What do we look for to make sure

587
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,039
we're buying the best things in a frozen

588
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,799
form? Well, first of all, you I would

589
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,360
stay away from vegetables that are

590
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,480
peeled, chopped, or crushed. Uh, look

591
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,080
for USDA certified organic vegetables,

592
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,160
which you can find. And, uh, some

593
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,320
vegetables, frozen corn for example,

594
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,120
actually have more nutrients than fresh

595
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,440
corn. They do. Yes. And there are some

596
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,799
new uh frozen super sweet varieties of

597
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,280
corn that I think are fantastic,

598
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,360
delicious. So frozen vegetables, you

599
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,760
know, if you choose them carefully, are

600
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,000
great. So let me all show you why what

601
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Dr. Wild says is so provocative happens

602
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,840
to be true. And it's true for a lot of

603
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,640
produce actually. Normally your produce

604
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,760
is picked way before it's ripe for a

605
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,360
reason. They've got to get it to you. So

606
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,039
to prevent spoiling, it's picked early,

607
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,880
not quite ripe yet. It's put into the

608
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,400
bin. They never quite developed the full

609
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,039
spectrum of vitamins, minerals, and

610
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,799
enzymes that mature ripening would have

611
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,320
allowed. So, your produce is short

612
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,080
changed nutritionally even before it

613
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
gets onto the truck. And then once it's

614
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,039
on the truck, the produce typically

615
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,039
travels more than 1,500 miles, 1,500

616
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,720
miles from the farm to your store. And

617
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,480
the amount of nutrients in your produce

618
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,960
diminish even more because of exposure

619
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,480
to the sunlight, for example, the time.

620
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,480
And then, of course, once it's on your

621
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,240
shelf, well, the produce is already

622
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,919
about a week old. And then after it's on

623
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
the shelf, it can sit there for another

624
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,840
four or five days because you haven't

625
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,440
bought it yet. And that produce section

626
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,280
happens to be the next stop. But please

627
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,799
remember this is the reason that frozen

628
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,280
stuff might make a difference for you.

629
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,720
So there are some vegetables, Dr. Wild,

630
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,799
you argue actually are probably worth

631
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,159
buying fresh. Well, I think all salad

632
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,120
greens obviously things like celery uh

633
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,520
and greens. I'm a big fan of greens and

634
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,039
I think they're often missing in the in

635
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,120
the American diet. They are great

636
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,320
nutritional powerhouses. inexpensive. Is

637
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,760
there one vegetable in particular you

638
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,360
think we're really missing out on? Well,

639
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,799
you know, I love charred which is

640
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,039
sitting here, but you know, also

641
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,679
collards, kale, which is here, all of

642
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,760
these things. And I like them briefly

643
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,600
cooked. I don't know where this idea

644
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,760
came from that's popular in the South of

645
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,000
cooking greens for hours, you know,

646
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,600
usually in a lot of bacon fat as well.

647
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,200
But, you know, if they're flashcooked,

648
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,600
stir fried in a little olive oil,

649
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,360
garlic, red pepper flakes, greens are

650
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,840
delicious and really good for you. Yeah.

651
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,200
So you you 30 seconds a minute I'd say

652
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,200
couple of minutes. Couple minutes till

653
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,360
they're bright green and still crunchy.

654
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,559
All right. Fruits uh been maligned of

655
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,400
late. They have a fair amount of sugar

656
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,960
in them. What's the rule for shopping?

657
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,280
Well, you want to get low glycemic load

658
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,280
fruits and berries you can't beat. I

659
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,440
mean the pigments in berries are

660
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,280
antioxidants that are strongly disease

661
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,600
protective. They're relatively low on

662
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,240
the glycemic load scale as compared with

663
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,840
tropical fruits. I I would get USDA

664
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,159
certified organic burries when you can

665
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,320
and look for really dark colored ones.

666
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,400
All right, the next trick on your list

667
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,240
uh is a problem for a lot of us. The

668
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,880
bread bakery where we go in there, we

669
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,000
smell it. Close your lungs up. You guys

670
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,520
probably smell this bread over there in

671
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,679
the audience already. What is the secret

672
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,200
to picking the healthiest bread? Well,

673
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,200
look, here's a little test that I used

674
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,400
to do when I was a kid and had bread

675
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,400
like this. I remember sitting at the

676
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,440
table. I would pull the crust off and

677
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,720
then see uh how small a a thing I could

678
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,799
get it in. Even you did that. If you can

679
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,480
get bread down to something like that or

680
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,480
or smaller, that is not the kind of

681
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,480
magic.

682
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,400
You want breads that are dense and that

683
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,480
don't that don't crush up like that, you

684
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,840
know, that are firmer. Uh and preferably

685
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,760
ones where you can see some cracked

686
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,440
grains in that have real substance.

687
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,039
These fluffy breads are the ones that

688
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,559
really spike blood sugar and are not

689
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,080
good for us. of the firm bread, which

690
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,320
one you like is a spelt is that your I

691
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,559
like spelt bread. That's a an an old

692
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,200
variety of wheat that's uh got a higher

693
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,960
protein content and uh grown in

694
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,159
healthier ways. That's one to try. See

695
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,000
if you like it. Yeah. And again, these

696
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,280
are not big price differences. Probably

697
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,679
no price difference. Buy the stuff that

698
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,960
makes sense. The olive oil is if it's

699
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,080
not in the bread, it ought to be there

700
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,039
because we always eat it. Absolutely.

701
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,400
Right. How do you know if you're buying

702
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,039
the right olive oil and how do you get

703
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,120
on a on a bargain? Okay. You you want to

704
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,720
taste olive oil and chop around because

705
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,360
price of olive oil doesn't necessarily

706
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,600
correlate with quality. Uh first of all,

707
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,520
you want to look for for olive oil that

708
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,320
is certified to be really olive oil

709
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,919
because there's been a lot of

710
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,320
adulteration of olive oil. That's been

711
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,159
much in the news. I like I use a sniff

712
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,559
test. I like olive oil that that

713
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,240
smells rich and fruity. Uh I like olive

714
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,640
oils that have a deep green color. And

715
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,400
also an interesting taste test. When you

716
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,039
taste olive oil, at the end of the

717
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,039
taste, often there's a peppery bite or

718
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,279
catch at the back of the throat. That's

719
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,720
a good thing. That's a compound called

720
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,720
oolioanthol that has an

721
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,640
anti-inflammatory effect as powerful as

722
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,000
ibuprofen. And you want that in your

723
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,159
olive oil. So look for olive oils that

724
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,520
have a peppery finish. Find the canned

725
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,520
aisle. This is a place where you can

726
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,279
save a lot of money and get yourself a

727
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,080
lot of health. Absolutely. This is this

728
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,320
is high quality protein. Really good for

729
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,720
us. We have sak canned sakkeye salmon

730
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,279
here. a very nutritious food. We've got

731
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,600
canned sardines and I like kippers,

732
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,600
which are smoked herring fililelets. Uh

733
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,559
canning softens the bones of these and

734
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,880
that's a good calcium source. These fish

735
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,120
all have a lot of omega-3 fatty acids in

736
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,360
them. And they're cheap. You know, these

737
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,440
are cheap sources of very high quality

738
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,520
protein and fat you can get in any

739
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,200

issue for you? The weight? Yes, I come

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,480
from a place of fat. My first diet was

761
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,120
first grade. And always entertaining.

762
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,760

ecigarettes called into question.

Whether you use them or not, why the

776
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,720
They're incredibly common. They are

777
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,480
thoroughly annoying and they hurt.

778
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,000
Talking about chapped lips and everyone

779
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,919
blames them on the cold weather. But

780
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
today, I'm going to reveal three sneaky

781
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,200
reasons that why your lips are so

782
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,559
chapped and what you can do to keep them

783
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,440
healthy. But I need my assistant to the

784
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,520
day to help out. So, how about seed 104?

785
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,279
Where's

786
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:17,400
104? Where's 104? Oh, we got a winner.

787
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,400
We have a winner.

788
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,520
I'm so happy you came.

789
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,640
How are you? Very good. Let's get you

790
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,480
dressed up here. Good. Thank you. What's

791
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,400
your name? Lisa. Lisa. Nice to meet you.

792
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,919
Hi. It's so nice to meet you. Is that a

793
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,000
Is that a wedding ring? Yes, it is. Is

794
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,440
that the proposer back there? Yes. Wave

795
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,880
your hands up there. You have very good

796
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,960
taste. Oh, thank you. Now, what's his

797
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,159
name? Aaron. Aaron. Aaron. Yeah. So,

798
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,080
when you're with Aaron, does he ever

799
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,440
comment on your lips? Yes, he does. Now,

800
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,559
as as a male, he probably only comment

801
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,480
on how beautiful they are, but does he

802
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,880
ever comment how chapped they might be?

803
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,399
Um, I think so. Maybe if he avoids a

804
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,919
kiss or something. Yes, that would be a

805
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,760
problem for him. So, what does it feel

806
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,760
like when you get chapped lips? Uh, like

807
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,520
burning and just very dry. It's the

808
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,720
worst. And it begins to crack sometimes

809
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,159
and you just don't know what to do about

810
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
it. Exactly. You came to the right show

811
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,360
today. Come on over here. I'm going to

812
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,880
show you why your lips are so vulnerable

813
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,320
and and what we can do to make sure it

814
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,520
doesn't happen again. Okay, so let's

815
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,600
first explain what's going on with your

816
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,440
lips. The lips and in fact the entire

817
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,200
body, the skin is made up of different

818
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,039
layers. Some parts of the body have

819
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,880
really thick amounts of skin. We have

820
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,720
to, right? These papers represent the

821
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,240
different amounts of skin we have in

822
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,399
different parts of our body. So let's

823
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,159
say the foot, you'll notice if you look

824
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,159
at a picture of the of the foot from the

825
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,760
side, it'll look like this. So you have

826
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,520
the sole of the foot with a normal skin

827
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,279
here. Then you have this big thick

828
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,559
layers of skin up there. So you can

829
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,000
dance around. Do you like to dance?

830
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,200
Yeah. What kind of dancing do you do?

831
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,279
Oh, anything. Anything. Is that true?

832
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,360
Good. Yes. He likes He likes everything

833
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,200
about you. All right. So So you have all

834
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,640
this skin here that's there to protect

835
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,320
you so you can walk around, do things

836
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,840
you need to do in life. But if you lose

837
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,279
a little bit, right? Go ahead. Help me a

838
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,559
little bit. Keep going. Keep going. Keep

839
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,679
going. No matter what you do to your

840
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,360
foot, there's always a lot left. Yes. So

841
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,880
you need that protection. So I'm glad

842
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,279
you're made with feet with lots of skin

843
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,960
on them. Okay. Your arms don't have as

844
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,320
much as your feet, but they still have

845
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,679
quite a bit. Okay. Okay. So again, if

846
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,120
you look at the picture here, you'll

847
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,880
notice that your arms have that same

848
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,799
base layer, but just a little bit on

849
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,960
top. So you, for example, if you go out

850
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,960
in the sun too much, you'll peel and you

851
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,840
don't lose that much. So out in the sun,

852
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,600
go ahead, throw a little bit of that

853
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,159
off, right? And even with a little bit

854
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,200
of sunburn, your your skin still has

855
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:28,159
plenty of redundancy on the arm. Okay?

856
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,679
But your lips, the precious lips, lips

857
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,240
he loves so much, the lips that you have

858
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,000
chapped, sometimes they look like this,

859
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,320
right? There's nothing on top of them at

860
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,279
all. It's barely what you need. And it's

861
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,360
like one single piece of precious paper.

862
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,720
Yes. You can't afford to waste it. It's

863
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,720
the only one you get. And because

864
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,159
they're so thin and because they also

865
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,799
don't have any oil glands in them, it's

866
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,880
like the Sahara Desert. Oh, the lips are

867
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,640
always problem having problems because

868
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,919
they can't replenish themselves. They

869
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,320
can't moisturize themselves like the

870
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,240
rest of our body. So that causes them

871
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,240
issues so many of us face. So when do

872
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,000
you normally get your chap lip issues?

873
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,159
Um winter and summer. Both. Yes. When

874
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,640
don't you get chap lips? Spring and

875
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,159
fall. Okay. So, come on. So, the winter

876
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,159
is actually pretty common because you

877
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,520
get cold, dry air. Yes. And summer

878
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,840
happens for different reasons. Often

879
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,799
because of the sun. But there are three

880
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,240
sneaky reasons, okay, for chafted lips.

881
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,600
I'm going to show them with you today.

882
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,039
Most people don't know about these, but

883
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,200
it's going to change you for the better.

884
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,440
The first is we forget putting SPF

885
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,559
protection on our lips. Okay? So, you

886
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,480
actually need to put some protection on

887
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,039
there. I pro I I think you ought to get

888
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,880
lip balms with at least 15 SPF on them.

889
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,320
Nothing less. It's easy to get that way.

890
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
And make sure every morning, all year

891
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,240
round, summer, winter, in including fall

892
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,640
and spring, I want you to put a little

893
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,559
bit on there. Simple to do. Okay. The

894
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,399
next sneaky reason that your lips are

895
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,440
chapped, that you breathe through your

896
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,559
mouth. Oh, really? Yes. Okay, that makes

897
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,520
There's a couple reasons for that. When

898
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,360
you breathe through your mouth instead

899
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,919
of through your nose, you end up taking

900
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,679
all the moisture off the lips. Oh.

901
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,520
Ventilating basically and evaporating

902
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,360
all the moisture off. And one of the

903
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,640
signs that we might be breathing through

904
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,919
our mouth and in fact the time when we

905
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,559
often will chap our lips when we're

906
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,240
sleeping if we're

907
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:11,600
snoring. Are you a snorer? Are you Is

908
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,919
she a snore? Am I a sto? She's a snore.

909
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,799
Yeah, we have double hands up. I got up

910
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,919
there. Oh gosh. Okay. So, okay. So, but

911
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,520
so when you wake up in the morning if

912
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,360
you feel parched, does that ever happen?

913
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,799
Always. So, you are a snorer. I am.

914
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,880
Yeah. You can store it any size. By the

915
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,880
way, it's not it's mostly men, but women

916
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,640
do it as well. So, I want you to keep on

917
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,240
your bedstand something that can allow

918
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,240
you to moisturize your lips. The key

919
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
ingredients to look for are coconut oil

920
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,720
and shea butter. Perfect. Okay. The

921
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,559
third one is my favorite one. The third

922
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,919
sneaky reason, and I built you a model

923
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,519
all for you, Lisa. Oh, nice. The third

924
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,120
surprising reason is that you're licking

925
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,200
your lips. Oh, let me see you lick.

926
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,399
Oh, you're out.

927
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,039
We all lick differently, by the way.

928
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,720
Notice your friends.

929
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:56,080
So, normally it gets dry after you

930
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,840
licked it. And then what do you do? I

931
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,039
lick it more. Lick it more. We all do

932
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,480
that. So, I built you a model to

933
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,480
demonstrate what happens. So, you get to

934
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,000
be the tongue. There's your tongue.

935
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,679
Okay. Put it in the saliva. That's the

936
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,120
saliva. And lick these lips. Okay. Lick

937
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,279
them up nicely. There we are. Put them

938
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,799
up. Yeah. Nice and moist. Now, what ends

939
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,880
up happening when you lick your lips is

940
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,240
the air begins to evaporate it, right?

941
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,960
So, all of a sudden, you get this stuff

942
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,720
going on, right? And as it evaporates,

943
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,080
watch what happens. It begins to chop

944
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,519
it. You see that? Yeah. You see that

945
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,200
happening? Yep. And you Well, you pull

946
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,880
your side off as well. You see it all

947
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,960
the whole thing begins to chap off and

948
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,360
you got these sort of raw surfaces here

949
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,320
which we don't want. All because of darn

950
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,080
tongue licking our lips. Now, instead of

951
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,679
doing this, you put that down. I want

952
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,039
you to do something very innovative.

953
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,240
I've never shown this on the show

954
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,880
before, but I want you all to do this

955
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,159
for me. And please, if you ever ever

956
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,440
thought you should trust me, trust me

957
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,559
this one time, okay? Cuz you're going to

958
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,320
it's going to change your life for the

959
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,600
better. So, you're going to take the

960
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,919
best source of oil you have. Okay.

961
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,480
What's the oilest part of your face? Um,

962
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,000
my nose. Yes. You take the oil for your

963
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,159
nose and one do this in the audience.

964
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,919
Take the oil from your nose like this.

965
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,480
Natural oils. Mother Nature gave it to

966
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,159
you and then apply it to your lips. Oh

967
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,399
my. It's not dirty. It's oil. It's

968
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,559
natural oil. Apply that. It's nature's

969
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,559
lip balm. Wow. It's free. It's all

970
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,320
yours.

971
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,600
Oh, come on now, people. That's what you

972
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,240
have me doing this. I'm doing it. I'm

973
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,519
doing it. And that's how you know that

974
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,640
you can protect your lips without having

975
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,559
to do anything hard. You have been

976
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,480
wonderful and congratulations. Take

977
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,480
care. We'll be right back.

978
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,480
Is there a natural remedy you use to

979
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,640
keep your lips from getting chapped? Dr.

980
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,720
Oz wants to hear from you. I actually

981
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,480
make my own lip balm. I use beeswax and

982
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,720
coconut oil. A little labor intensive,

983
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,440
but it works great. I love it. Share

darling Wendy Williams gets real. The

993
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,560
scale registered a lot. 193 lbs. Does it

994
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,399
affect your self-esteem at all?

995
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,079
Revealing. Has it been a lifelong issue

996
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,919
for you? The weight? Yes. I come from a

997
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,720
place of fat. My first diet was first

998
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,359
grade and always entertaining. You had a

999
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,879
little work done. Yes, I did. Can you

1000
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,270
tell how her health secrets help you?

1001
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:34,619
That's coming up tomorrow on Dr.

1002
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,619
[Music]

1003
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,720
Oz. This year I am focusing on the small

1004
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,720
steps make big changes in your life. And

1005
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,399
it's in the one room you make your most

1006
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,000
important health decisions, your

1007
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,320
kitchen. Sue Perry's joining me. She's

1008
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
the deputy editor for Shop Smart

1009
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,679
Magazine. So, what do you do? How are

1010
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,760
you? Thanks for being here. Good to see

1011
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,879
you. I went to visit Sue's setup and I

1012
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,079
was so intrigued by some of these

1013
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,440
insights that I wanted to have you here

1014
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,720
to share with everybody else. But let's

1015
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,079
first talk about the kitchen. Why is it

1016
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,839
so important for our health? Well, first

1017
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
of all, it's where we prepare food. So,

1018
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,040
it's got to be super clean. You don't

1019
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,280
want to be cleaning, you know, preparing

1020
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,480
food in the dirty dishes. Plus, it gets

1021
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,480
a little challenging because it's the

1022
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,320
hub of the house. Everybody hangs out.

1023
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,079
Everybody drops the mail and backpacks.

1024
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,000
It becomes homework central. It's more

1025
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,359
of a challenge to keep clean. And lots

1026
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,560
of craziness happens there, which is why

1027
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,720
we're going to focus on it. And I asked

1028
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,640
three viewers to send in their kitchen

1029
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,079
dilemmas. And so the healthy 10-second

1030
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,760
solution to each. Take a look at

1031
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,720
Evelyn's kitchen dilemma. I'm sure you

1032
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,040
will all relate to it. My dishwasher

1033
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,440
gets so unorganized and it's always way

1034
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,079
too full. And I end up having to do two

1035
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,000
loads. I need some tips and tricks so

1036
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,599
that I have more time to spend with my

1037
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,280
girls and are not up all night cleaning.

1038
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,280
So, Evelyn's here in the studio. That's

1039
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,960
a big pile of dishes. How long does it

1040
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,720
take to get through all that? I feel

1041
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,560
like it takes me forever to get through

1042
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,480
those dishes, and I end up having to do

1043
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,960
multiple loads just to get them cleaned.

1044
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,040
So, Sue, the 10-second solution for

1045
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,119
dishwashing, which is not a major part

1046
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,280
of our life anymore. Oh, first of all,

1047
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,800
all dishwashers actually have a pattern

1048
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,480
of how they should be loaded. And your

1049
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
manual is going to tell you that. And if

1050
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,240
you don't have your manual, don't worry.

1051
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,560
There's actually a general tip. The

1052
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,640
dirty side of the plate always faces in

1053
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,720
toward the center. Now, this dishwasher,

1054
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,680
we looked at the manual, and so we know

1055
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,359
that all the dishes go in this way. But

1056
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,079
look what happens if you did it

1057
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,520
halfhazardly. Your the water jets are

1058
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,280
not going to hit that. And what you want

1059
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,880
to do is not block your water jets. You

1060
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,560
want to have your dishes sitting

1061
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,680
upright. So that's anybody at home who

1062
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,440
doesn't know how to outload their

1063
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,119
dishes. That's one little tip of how you

1064
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,119
can have. Again, this is crazy, but in

1065
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,960
this case, every one of the dishes will

1066
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,560
be angled in that direction. That's how

1067
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,720
it's supposed to be. That's how it's

1068
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,640
supposed to be. Now, the silverware, it

1069
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,079
seems like the easy thing to do to put

1070
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,680
all the spoons together, all the forks

1071
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,240
together, and all of that. But you know

1072
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,520
what they do? They nest. They clump

1073
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,280
together and they're not going to get

1074
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,359
the water jets. Called spooning for a

1075
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,960
reason. Spooning for a reason. So, you

1076
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,560
want to mix it up. Okay, great. So,

1077
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,760
we're all good here. Okay, perfect. Then

1078
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,040
this plastic, if you can address that

1079
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,320
for me, cuz this is one big issue.

1080
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,280
Plastic never goes in the bottom. Never

1081
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,640
in the bottom because the heating

1082
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,480
element is there. It can melt the

1083
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,480
plastic. So, your plastic goes up here.

1084
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,079
Okay. Thank you so much. Arena sent me

1085
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,480
her kitchen dilemma. It has to do with a

1086
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,880
special kitchen odor.

1087
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,040
Dr. Oz, I feel like I constantly have an

1088
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,560
odor coming out of my microwave. Do you

1089
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,200
have any tips and tricks on how I can

1090
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,720
better keep it smelling fresh and clean?

1091
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,400
So, Arena is joining us. What have you

1092
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,400
tried to get rid of that odor in your

1093
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,640
microwave? Well, I'm a working mother of

1094
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,440
a one-year-old and I tend to use the

1095
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,040
microwave to reheat food, to defrost.

1096
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,880
So, I've been using harsh chemicals and

1097
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,960
I wish I had another solution. Take it

1098
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,400
away, Shu. Lemons. Lemons. There's

1099
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,839
nothing harsh about it. And they're

1100
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,359
they're cleaning. I mean, you think

1101
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,119
about lemon scent is in all kinds of

1102
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,760
cleaning solutions. It just smells so

1103
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,760
good. What you can do is just we chopped

1104
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,359
up some lemons here. It doesn't have to

1105
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,520
be perfect. You can take half a lemon,

1106
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,240
chop it up, put it in about a cup of

1107
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,240
water in a microwave safe bowl. Put it

1108
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,560
in the microwave on high for about a

1109
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,359
minute and let it boil just about a

1110
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,200
minute. And then 10 to 15 minutes. Let

1111
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,560
it just sit there. Open up the door.

1112
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,040
You're going to have some vapors. Wipe

1113
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,800
it out. It's clean. Perfect. And that's

1114
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,480
simple. I don't know why you didn't tell

1115
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,640
me this before. I know. And it makes the

1116
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,560
kitchen smell good, too. The citric acid

1117
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,079
we think binds up the odor particles,

1118
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,599
but I love the concept. All right. We

1119
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,200
have Charlene. She has a problem with

1120
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,200
grease buildup. Hi, Dr. Oz. I need your

1121
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,880
help. I always have a problem getting

1122
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,200
the greasy residue off of my

1123
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,119
refrigerator and even in my cabinets. Is

1124
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,359
there something that I should be doing?

1125
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,720
I need to be a surgeon just like you

1126
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,320
just to clean it. Can you help me?

1127
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,400
Charlene's a surgeon like me. Thank you

1128
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,520
for a compliment. So, how much time do

1129
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,880
you spend trying to get the grease off

1130
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,560
the top of refrigerators and other

1131
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,720
places in your house? I'd say about a

1132
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,040
good 20 25 minutes just trying to get

1133
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,520
the gunky oil off the top as well as

1134
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,400
also um the residue that's on that forms

1135
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,920
on the cabinets and um I'd like to be

1136
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,280
spending my time doing more things like

1137
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,200
watching our show. Well, you're very

1138
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,720
kind. 10 seconds to all I'm giving you.

1139
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,000
What's the solution? Okay, the solution

1140
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,480
is first of all, you have to clean off

1141
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,960
the gunk. So, dish dishwashing liquid

1142
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,200
and hot water is a great uh grease

1143
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,800
buster to clean off the surfaces. But

1144
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,240
once you clean it off and you get up

1145
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,599
here, if you go up on there, I'm going

1146
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,760
to tell you what we're going to do.

1147
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,119
Whoops. This is a really cool idea.

1148
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,200
Can't do this in heels. Here's the

1149
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:24,960
trick. You take the You take the end of

1150
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,720
this and I'm going to plastic wrap

1151
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,480
plastic wrap on top of the fridge.

1152
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,040
You'll never have to clean off the gunk

1153
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,839
again. What we're going to do is we're

1154
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,520
going to cover the surface. If you don't

1155
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,160
have plastic wrap and you have wax

1156
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,920
paper, does the same thing, craft paper,

1157
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,839
anything like that. And we're just going

1158
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,040
to cover this surface.

1159
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:47,440
Overlap. Make sure the surface is all

1160
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,520
covered. And then in a few weeks, ball

1161
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,040
it all up, throw it out, and do the same

1162
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,480
thing again. You will never have to

1163
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,240
clean the gunk off your top of your

1164
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,240
fridge. You can do it on hot cabinets.

1165
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,119
Yes, I am. You can find a gallery of my

1166
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,359
favorite 10-second gets at dr.com. We'll

1167
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,359
be right back.

1168
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,200
What's your favorite microwave hack?

1169
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,440
With a young child, we're always looking

1170
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,359
for ways to save money. When our sponges

1171
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,119
get a little old, I moisten them and put

1172
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,240
it in the microwave for a minute. Perks

1173
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:20,079
it right up. Good as new. Share yours on

1174
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,480
facebook.com/drz. Tomorrow on Dr. Oz,

1175
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:26,000
daytime darling Wendy Williams gets

1176
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,680
real. The scale registered a lot. 193

1177
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
lbs. Does it affect your self-esteem at

1178
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,520
all? Revealing. Has it been a lifelong

1179
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,359
issue for you? The weight? Yes, I come

1180
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,240
from a place of fat. My first diet was

1181
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,960
first grade and always entertaining. You

1182
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,760
had a little work done. Yes, I did. Can

1183
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,120
you tell? How her health secrets help

1184
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:50,469
you. That's coming up tomorrow on Dr.

1185
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,469
[Music]

1186
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:57,440
Oz. We've told you computer games are a

1187
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,160
great way to exercise your memory. Take

1188
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:04,640
a look at this dog. Violet the Italian

1189
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,640
greyhound took that tip to a whole new

1190
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,599
level. If you look careful, this is the

1191
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,000
best part about this. This is actually a

1192
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,280
game for cats. Those are goldfish. But

1193
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,720
Violet doesn't care. She's pretending

1194
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,000
she's a cat right now. We should all

1195
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,560
take a note from Violet. She attacks

1196
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,240
that iPad. Simple games are easy to

1197
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,599
access and can be played quickly. They

1198
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,359
improve the players moods. They promote

1199
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,680
relaxation. They ward up anxiety. Violet

1200
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,800
is a very happy dog today. Now, it's

1201
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,760
time for, in case you missed it, a

1202
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,200
couple of things I want you to remember

1203
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,040
from today's show. We had a big

1204
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,440
conversation about pelvic exams. There's

1205
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,200
news that says your yearly pelvic exam

1206
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,200
is no longer needed. Now, this is

1207
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,200
especially important for all women in

1208
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,480
their 20s, 30s, and 40s who've had their

1209
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,839
kids and think they no longer need to go

1210
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,839
to their OB/GYN, but top OBGYn still say

1211
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,520
there is value in a pelvic exam. If your

1212
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,760
doctor doesn't offer one, you probably

1213
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,680
ought to make it an an opportunity to

1214
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,280
suggest it to them. Next, good news for

1215
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,720
anyone who's been caught without lip

1216
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,160
balm. And here's what you can do.

1217
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,880
Instead of licking your lips, it's going

1218
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,800
to sound odd, but I want you to take

1219
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,800
your fingers, rub it on the side of your

1220
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,040
nose. That's where mother nature's

1221
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,720
provided your skin with natural oils.

1222
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,440
Remember, it's not dirty. It's just oil.

1223
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,119
And then apply it as a balm to your lip.

1224
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,640
I see you grimacing out there. I want

1225
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,400
everyone to do this. Just try it once,

1226
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,319
please. Just trust me just once. Take

1227
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,640
the oil from the side of your nose and

1228
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,079
put it on your lips. There we are. It

1229
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,319
doesn't taste bad, does it? It's your

1230
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,680
own oil. Thank you for trusting me. I

1231
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,040
want to close with a warning. Please be

1232
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,319
careful about what you buy online,

1233
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,000

1234
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,680

1238
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,520
endorsing their products, which I don't.
