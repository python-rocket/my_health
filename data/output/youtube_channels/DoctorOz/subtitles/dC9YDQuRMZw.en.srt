00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,920
An ER doctor goes from saving lives.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,240
Immediately, I felt drugged to

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,160
destroying one. I felt him groping me.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,970
And you won't believe the defense he

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:23,320
used. Isn't it the perfect cover

00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:26,710

00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,839

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,280
That TED talk with more than 18 million

10
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,320
views was hosted by a prominent doctor

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,840
with a seemingly perfect life. Was

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,320
picture perfect. Dr. David Newman was a

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,079
top emergency room physician and an

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,160
accomplished author who preached about

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,640
rebuilding the trust between doctors and

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,719
patients. But underneath the surface,

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
things were far from what they seemed.

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,039
Newman was charged with sex abuse,

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,359
targeting, drugging, and assaulting

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,039
young women in the emergency room. Now,

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,440
this isn't the first time we've heard

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,760
about a case like this. Today, in our

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,560
Dirty Doctor's investigation, could a

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,280
doctor perfect be praying on you.

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,280
Joining me now is Aza. She's one of four

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,280
women who fell victim to Dr. Newman's

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,040
secret abuse. Thank you very much for

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,400
joining me. Thank you, Das. I know this

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,880
is difficult to recount. I appreciate

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,080
you coming on the show. When you first

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,479
met Dr. Newman. What was the setting? I

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,119
met him after attending the emergency

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,960
room uh close to where I lived. And what

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
had brought you to the emergency room?

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,400
Oh, I was actually having crucial pain.

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,159
I thought that I was having a heart

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,479
attack. Thank god I wasn't. But And

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,040
where was the pain? Um it was like a

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,200
sharp pain. It kind of started from

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,200
midback all the way down. Mostly the

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,960
shoulder and the arms. Okay. So you're

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,320
in there. Your first impression of Dr.

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,119
Newman? Um he was nice. He was friendly.

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,119
is brief. Pretty much your usual

45
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,680
experience in the emergency room. I just

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,719
figured he was a doctor's here help.

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,079
Pretty nice. And as it started, did he

48
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,520
do anything in his examinations or

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,880
anything else that made you a little bit

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,000
leerary that something wasn't quite

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
right? Actually, yes. He um as I was

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,920
telling you just now, you know, I had

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,440
pain on my right side. Um one of the red

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
flags that I kind of go back in my head

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,440
was he did a breast exam. He kind of

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,720
touched the wrong breast. He was like on

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,080
this side but you know once again it's

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,720
like you know this is a doctor this a

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,920
person that you immediately trust. So it

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,000
was just like you know wrong side you

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,519
know not that wasn't the side I kind of

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,440
just directed his attention back over

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
here. So you give him a pass on that

64
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,959
right now the nurse had already given

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,599
you a little bit of medication for the

66
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,519
pain you were suffering from. Right. And

67
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,280
I understand something else happened

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,800
that Dr. Newman did that made you more

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,879
concerned. Exactly. And the other thing

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
that he did was uh he also gave me

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,879
another shot of what I believe then was

72
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,319
morphine but later turned out to be

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,800
propall propall right

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,640
propall is a is a powerful sedative you

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
may actually remember the drug because

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,959
it was what Michael Jackson used to get

77
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,599
asleep at nights it's not usually used

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,040
as a treatment for pain and more

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,640
importantly Michael Jackson we believe

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,560
died from that propall so it's sort of a

81
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,360
dangerous thing to give in a an

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,879
unmonitored setting well so so you're

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
you're given been narcotics, you get

84
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,200
another shot of something at the time

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,640
you thought it was narcotics. Did that

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,640
strike you as strange? Were you feeling

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,239
enough pain to warrant more treatment?

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,319
Yeah, absolutely. Actually, that is

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,519
exactly what strike me, you know, um

90
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,599
immediately I felt drugged with the

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,159
second dose. Yes. And then what

92
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,519
happened? Uh that things got creepy

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,959
after that. I immediately, like I said,

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,080
I felt like I was drugged. Um I went out

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,920
of consciousness. Um, I was fighting it.

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
It was a heavy feeling. Made me feel

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
like I was falling asleep, but at the

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,080
same time, like, you know, you have to

99
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,720
stay up. Wait a minute. Hold on. What's

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,159
going on?

101
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,599
Um, I had moments where I felt like I

102
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,080
was trying to speak and I couldn't

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,400
speak. Uh my bed was I felt my bed moved

104
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,120
while you know during my pass out state

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,080
I felt my bed move from against the wall

106
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,639
and um I felt him groping me

107
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,959
and you know I felt I heard the sound of

108
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,000
skin rubbing you know like someone is

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,620
jack um

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,960
masturbating and

111
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,320
[Music]

112
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,919
um yeah that went on for a few minutes

113
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,720
and my bed moved back against the wall.

114
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,000
I heard the doors

115
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,680
open. Like I said, you know, during this

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,840
time, I'm in and out of consciousness.

117
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm trying to get up, trying to fight

118
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,919
like, you know, this heavy seditive that

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,479
I'm feeling, and I couldn't quite do it.

120
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,080
Um, when I did come to, I felt

121
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,919
like you're never prepared for that. You

122
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,759
you you wonder if you're imagining that,

123
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,720
you're like, did that just happen? You

124
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:02,160
know, um, what just happened? Uh, I went

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,759
to the restroom and I noticed I had

126
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,759
semen in between my

127
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:11,440
breasts. So, that was like, yeah, this

128
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,530
happened. It happened. And I had a

129
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,039
decision to make, you know,

130
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,320
[Music]

131
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,320
um, are you going to go out there and

132
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,919
yell and scream at someone and say, hey,

133
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,680
did you do this to me? Because, of

134
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,120
course, I didn't think that would go

135
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,400
well. So, I questioned myself like, what

136
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,320
do you do next? What are you going to

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,800
do? you know, you are you can die in

138
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,360
here because I'm also, you know, still

139
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,280
fighting off this drug. I'm feeling and

140
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,759
then like, you know, I'm completely

141
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,000
tired in and out of consciousness even

142
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,320
what my, you know, getting up and

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,400
pretending that I'm fine. Did the nurses

144
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,240
realize that you were overdrugged? A

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,919
nurse did come in and out the room. Um,

146
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
actually a few people didn't. She was

147
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,320
immediately concerned. She was like,

148
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,759
"Why is she like this?" Um, like I said,

149
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,199
you know, during that time I was in and

150
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,560
out of consciousness. I heard this. I

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,720
heard a lot of people coming in and out

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,720
the room, you know, responded to my name

153
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,560
is Aza. Are you okay? Are you okay? But

154
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
I couldn't really get up. I couldn't say

155
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
anything. So So now you got a big

156
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,000
decision to make. You you realize this

157
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,840
is real. This nightmare actually

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,400
happened, right? What' you decide to do?

159
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,560
I decided to tell one of the hospital

160
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,479
staff at first. Um the PA I wind up

161
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,440
getting up the courage to tell him, you

162
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,600
know, he came in the room, he's like,

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,560
"Oh, you're awake?" And I'm like,

164
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,960
"Yeah."

165
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:38,080
Um the doctor that was, you know,

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:44,000
examining me, he actually masturbated

167
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,000
and did this to me. And his response

168
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,600
was nonchalant. Just very It's like,

169
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
"Okay, so you want me to call the cops

170
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,880
or something?

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,880
And I was so taken back. I was like,

172
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,400
"Wow, are you serious? Like, did you

173
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,560
hear what I said to you?" And he's like,

174
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,400
"Yeah, you what do you want to do?" And

175
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm like, "Go get your supervisor."

176
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,759
Because at this point, I want to scream.

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,440
I'm upset. You know, I'm raped. Of

178
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,440
course you are. Yeah. And I'm like, "Go

179
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,199
get your supervisor." And he's like,

180
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,199
"I'm confused." I'm like, "What are you

181
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,120
confused about?" He's like, "That was

182
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,919
my, you know, the person you're accusing

183
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
of doing this is is my supervisor."

184
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,960
Oh my goodness. Dr. Newman was in charge

185
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,120
of the ER. Yes. So, at that point in

186
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,280
time, I'm like, you know what? Give me

187
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,960
my discharge papers. I want to go. My

188
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,880
shoulder doesn't hurt that much, right?

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,880
Let me get out of here. Because I'm

190
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,360
afraid at this point, you know, what

191
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,039
what if what if I fall asleep and I

192
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,960
don't make it out of here? Who's going

193
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,880
to believe what I had to say at that

194
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,360
moment? you know, I don't have any proof

195
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,280
of this, which is why I decided when I

196
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,680
was leaving, you know, take sheets, do

197
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,319
anything I can to, you know, defend

198
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,479
myself because I was still feeling the

199
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,560
sedatives really heavy at this point in

200
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,680
time and I'm

201
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,039
like, I'm not going to make it out of

202
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,360
here, but damn it, I'm going to try. So,

203
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,960
you do make it out of there. I do of you

204
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
to to fight this whole thing. And what

205
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,440
do you do? And I call the cops. Soon as

206
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,560
I get away and I get home, I call the

207
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,879
cops and my sister, you know, um, and I

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,560
let everybody know what happened and

209
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,400
they come and they take me to the

210
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,400
hospital. Well, another hospital, not

211
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,840
the same

212
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,120
hospital. And, um, we call authorities

213
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,000
and everything else from there. So, they

214
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,919
took the sample Yes. of the rape kit.

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
The rape kid. Mhm. And then what

216
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,880
happened to the Dr. Newman? uh he was

217
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,719
arrested once um he was arrested before

218
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,760
that and um at some point in time the

219
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,919
DNA came back and matched you know his

220
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,479
how has this impacted you every single

221
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,479
day since

222
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,160
then you never get over something like

223
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,320
this you know you never get over it but

224
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,519
um it's definitely made me realize that

225
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,360
you always have to trust yourself you

226
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,399
have to speak up and you have to be

227
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,320
responsible, you know, no matter what.

228
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,600
Um, it's sad to say that you look at

229
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,519
people in emergency rooms different, but

230
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,440
I do.

231
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,080
Well, Dr. Newman plead guilty to four

232
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,600
counts of sexual abuse. In court, his

233
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,519
defense says that he was going through a

234
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,120
hypomomanic episode from bipolar

235
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,640
disorder. So, coming up, what our true

236
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,720
crime panel has to say about this

237
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,200
defense. Did an illness turn a perfect

238
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,880
doctor into a sex fiend that drugged and

239
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,640
abused a woman? Stay with

240
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,800
us. We are back investigating Dr.

241
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,040
Perfects. Seemingly perfect doctors who

242
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,200
are hiding secret sex abuse, drugging

243
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,880
women and taking advantage of them. It

244
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,360
claimed emergency room physician David

245
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,040
Newman was arrested and convicted of

246
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,040
drugging and sexually assaulting his

247
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,399
patients. At a hearing, his defense said

248
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,480
that Newman was suffering from a

249
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,160
hypomomanic episode from bipolar

250
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,160
disorder. So, here's the question. Did

251
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,399
an illness really turn a perfect doctor

252
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,240
into a sex fiend? Joining our true crime

253
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,000
panel today is trial attorney Heather

254
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,640
Hansen from Law and Crime and

255
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,959
psychiatrist Dr. Judith Joseph. So

256
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Heather, we just heard from one of uh

257
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,399
Dr. Newman's victims. It's pretty

258
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,760
graphic what he did. He gave her

259
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
propathol which could have risked her

260
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
life. He then took advantage of her.

261
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,519
What do you make out of this bipolar

262
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,040
disorder defense? It's a difficult

263
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,720
defense to make. Dr. O. He already

264
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,640
pleaded. So he did his time. He did his

265
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
two years. Now, the reason for this

266
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,800
defense is he doesn't want to have to

267
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,880
register for as long as he might have

268
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,200
to. He has a sex offender. A sex

269
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040
offender. Exactly. He has to register

270
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
for sure. But if it's level one, it's

271
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,440
only 20 years. And if it's level two or

272
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,519
three, it's the rest of his life. And

273
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
registering might impact his ability to

274
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,839
practice medicine, but not necessarily,

275
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,279
which is really unfortunate. Sometimes

276
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,519
registered sex offenders can actually

277
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,279
practice. Dr. Joseph, I'm stunned by

278
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,880
that. Isn't it? I mean, you think people

279
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,640
are really vulnerable to their doctors.

280
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,079
Yes. As a psychiatrist, you have

281
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,880
insights into bipolar disorder, what

282
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,640
motivates them. Could a perfect doctor,

283
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
seemingly perfect anyway, turn into a

284
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,040
sex fiend because of a psychiatric

285
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,600
ailment like bipolar disorder? So, man,

286
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,600
mania and hypomomania are all hallmarks

287
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,920
of bipolar disorder. And when I've

288
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,640
treated severe bipolar episodes, there

289
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,000
are other symptoms besides

290
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,320
hypersexuality. You see someone with

291
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,240
racing thoughts, they're pacing, they're

292
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,920
highly distractable. There's no way that

293
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
they can function in a highpowered

294
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,519
hospital like this. Something is very

295
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,120
inconsistent with this story. Just to be

296
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,880
clear, mania is the high part of a

297
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,360
bipolar. So, you start to think you can

298
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,200
do everything and hypersexuality is a

299
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,320
part of that. But to your point, you

300
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,760
shouldn't be able to do any of the other

301
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,120
things you need to do to work in an ER,

302
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,800
especially something as complicated as

303
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,800
allegedly dosing such a powerful

304
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,720
anesthetic. It's does not add up. Right.

305
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,959
So, the guy worked at a prominent New

306
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,880
York City hospital. I mean, reputable

307
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
place. He seemed to have it all. Yes.

308
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,240
How do you hide this perfect persona?

309
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,240
How did he fool everybody? Isn't it the

310
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,760
perfect cover up? Yes. The mask of

311
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,440
sociopathy. And so, yeah, sociopaths can

312
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,200
be white collared. They can be

313
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,800
professionals. They can be college

314
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
students. And so, when you take

315
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,720
advantage of a position of power over

316
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,040
the powerless, you are exercising your

317
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,160
sociopathic capabilities.

318
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,839
Unbelievable. Thank you very much for

319
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,920
both your advice. Let me bring back in

320
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,519
Aza, who has came forward about the

321
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,279
abuse she suffered while sedated under

322
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,920
Dr. Newman's care. Her lawyer, Katherine

323
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,480
Smith, joins us now. So, Ara, when you

324
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,000
heard this hypomomanic defense, this

325
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,399
argument that he had a psychiatric

326
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,079
problem, what did you think? I thought

327
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:29,360
it was a joke. Um, it's, you know, it's

328
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,519
very frustrating. It's kind of sad that

329
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,079
people get to hide behind this kind of

330
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,800
facade

331
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:38,560
and I don't believe it personally, but

332
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,800
he wrote a book about bringing patients

333
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,959
and physicians closer together. I It's

334
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,800
ironic, right? that the definition of

335
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,160
trust is to make sure that your bond,

336
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,399
your covenant with your patient is

337
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,360
close, right? How do you reconcile that

338
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,920
with the man who assaulted you? You

339
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,200
don't you sit there and you kind of feel

340
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,639
like this individual is calculated and

341
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,399
it, you know, it's scary. It's scary. It

342
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,399
brings a different fear to you

343
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,399
awareness,

344
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,560
but I don't buy it personally. Dr.

345
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,120
Newman. Where is he now? Do you know?

346
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,279
Oh, he's free. I guess he's living his

347
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,880
life. He's released.

348
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,000
Is he working? I'm not sure. I'm glad

349
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,160
you put your hand up. You could have

350
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,680
gotten shot, but you saved others. So,

351
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,200
thank you for doing that. We reached out

352
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,880
to Dr. Newman's attorney for a

353
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,880
statement. Did not hear back in time for

354
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,200
the taping. Katherine, what can a woman

355
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,880
like Aza do if she's in an emergency

356
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,800
room? She's completely vulnerable at

357
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,160
that point and she's got an emergency

358
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,240
situation and there's a doctor that

359
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,639
she's uncomfortable with. Well, that's

360
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,560
what's tough because obviously there's

361
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
nothing you can do 100% to word against

362
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,839
this and it's certainly not the victim's

363
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,240
fault, but there are certain precautions

364
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,639
that we can take such as if you ever

365
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,800
feel uncomfortable in any way, asking

366
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,120
for a chaperone to come into the room is

367
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,880
a completely reasonable request. Um,

368
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,680
speaking up immediately and making a

369
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,600
complaint, as Aza did, in most hospital

370
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,240
environments, that is enough to warrant

371
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,399
a full investigation. Um, and also just

372
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,079
knowing while of course seeking out the

373
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,240
medical care that you need, also knowing

374
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,079
that just because someone wears a white

375
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,519
coat and they have charisma does not

376
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,600
mean that they're immune from doing bad

377
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,600
things. Well said. Thank you for coming

378
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
forward. I wish you the best. Thank you
