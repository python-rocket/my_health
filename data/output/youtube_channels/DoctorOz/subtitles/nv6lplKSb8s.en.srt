2
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,640
Today on Oz. It's a popular

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,200
over-the-counter painkiller found in

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,679
many products. But is it killing more

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,000
than the pain? What is it and how you

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,640
can overdose without ever knowing? Plus,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,880
a glass of wine to help you unwind is

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,039
fine. But what happens when it becomes a

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:28,519
crutch? The plan to control drinking

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,519
before it controls you. Coming up next.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,960
Instead of menopen, chances are this

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,399
popular over-the-counter painkiller used

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
to treat everything from headaches to

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,239
backachches is in your medicine cabinet

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,320
right now. But today, a startling new

16
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,640
headline. 80,000 people a year are

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,879
accidentally overdosing and ending up in

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,760
the emergency room with serious, even

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,640
fatal liver damage. Sadly, doesn't take

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,120
a lot to get you there. It's the most

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,680
commonly used pain reliever in America.

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,079
But now acetime is also the most common

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,320
cause of acute liver failure. That's the

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,240
shocking conclusion in a new consumer

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,159
reports expose of the dangers of

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,080
painkillers. Taking too much acetime can

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,960
cause problems for your kidneys, but it

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,960
can be especially toxic to your liver.

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,920
Every week, an estimated 50 million

30
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,439
Americans take medications containing

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,240
acetime to treat everything from joint

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,360
and muscle pain to headaches, allergies,

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,119
colds, and the flu. You got it without a

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
prescription. You've trusted it for

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,720
years. But should you think twice before

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,720
popping a pill with

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,240
acetime? This affects everybody watching

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,759
now. Joining us from Emory University

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,320
Hospital Emergency Department is Dr.

40
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,040
Daria Long Gillespie who sees acetime

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,560
overdoses all too often. Why has this

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
become such a widespread problem? Well,

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
Dr. Oz, acetaminophen is so widely used

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,640
and for good reason. Because at

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
recommended doses, it's safe. It gives

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,079
people good pain control without a

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,079
prescription with very rare side

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,399
effects. However, people become very

49
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,159
familiar with it and think that any dose

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
can be a safe dose. And that's where I,

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,000
as a physician, get concerned because

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,920
just because it's over- the-counter

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,920
doesn't mean it's candy. And on the

54
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,760
contrary, if you take much higher than

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,080
recommended doses, you can get liver

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,840
failure and even death. So, when people

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,200
come to you in the ER and you think they

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,720
may have this problem, what kinds of

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,800
symptoms are they having? Well, that's a

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,360
key lesson is that you cannot wait for

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,959
symptoms. They may not arise until 24 to

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
48 hours after you've taken the

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,120
medication and may not even be until you

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,040
have liver damage. Even when you do have

65
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
symptoms, they're non-specific. So, we

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,280
have nausea, vomiting, weakness,

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,519
generalized bodyaches, and eventually

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,920
leading to things like jaundice, dark

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,360
urine, confusion, and coma. Before I

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,720
tell everybody what the dangerous dose

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
is because I do want you to know that

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,239
number. Let me show everybody what

73
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
medications are out there that contain a

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
cetime because this is the reality. A

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,760
lot of you don't know how many different

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
places it is found. Look at this table.

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,480
I've got some of the biggest brands out

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,720
there. All again when taken as directed,

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,840
they are safe. But the danger lies that

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,840
in that you don't know how much

81
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,000
acetaphen is hiding in these bottles.

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,560
Again, we have Tylenol, extra Tylenol,

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,840
Alka-Seltzer, uh you know, Nyquil,

84
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,080
frankly, uh Dayquil, uh Theraplu, uh

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,760
there's all kinds of roptosin cold, uh

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,159
you you we've got things that I would

87
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,840
never I would never have expected my

88
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,440
doll. And when you look at this

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,599
different array of products used for

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,200
very different problems, you begin to

91
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,280
realize how you could take a lot more of

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,680
this stuff instead of menophen than you

93
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,879
realize. So how much what's the magic

94
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,799
number for us to keep in the back of our

95
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,040
minds is too much acetame? We as

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,440
physicians recommend no more than four

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,680
grams in a 24-hour period. So that can

98
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,200
be eight of the extra strength tablets

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,720
or as you can see each of these

100
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,959
medications may have a different

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,959
concentration. So people really have to

102
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,599
look at how much acetaminophen is in

103
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,440
each medication. And what if you do take

104
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,120
too much acetamophan, what can it do to

105
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,519
your liver? Well, actually what it does

106
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,040
is your liver processes acetaminophen.

107
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,360
So if you take too much of it, it can

108
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,400
overwhelm your body's ability to process

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,239
and start to cause liver damage. So I

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
couldn't let the show go without doing a

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,720
little demonstration for you. Uh so I

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,879
put my thinking cap on. And this is your

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,640
liver. And these are the chemicals the

114
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,720
liver has that that Daria was

115
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,720
describing. And they're there to protect

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
you and to protect the liver. So you

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,400
take blood that has a little too much

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,240
acetaminophen in it, the four grams he

119
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,759
spoke of, and it wipes away those

120
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,199
protective chemicals. They're not there.

121
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
Now remember, your liver is the big

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
detox organ of the body. It has to be

123
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,240
there for you. So when those chemicals

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,600
are all gone, toxins that aren't

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,520
supposed to be able to get to your liver

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,000
directly get right in there. And when

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,320
that happens, watch what occurs. You

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,520
literally begin to eat away and dissolve

129
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,000
the liver. Unfortunately, liver

130
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,400
literally can get soupy. It begins to to

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,840
fall apart inside your body. So, what's

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,320
the best way to protect yourself from

133
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,680
this happening without you realizing it?

134
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,360
Well, as we mentioned, you can't wait

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,360
for symptoms because you can already

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,840
cause liver damage before you have your

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,160
symptoms. So, I want everybody to know

138
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
your dose. Look at your medications and

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,600
know how much you're taking. Do the math

140
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,120
and add it up. And then there's a great

141
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
resource that everyone needs to know

142
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,919
about if you're ever concerned about

143
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
taking too much. It's the poison control

144
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,160
hotline. 1

145
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,039
8002221222. 24/7. We'll get you a

146
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,639
toxicologist that specializes in this

147
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,800
and can answer your questions. So before

148
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,080
you run off to the ER, call it's free.

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,280
Absolutely free. They can give you

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,960
advice about whether what you've done

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,160
may be causing a problem like this.

152
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
Let's go over the risk factors again. I

153
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,080
want everyone to be clear about this.

154
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,400
You can if you're taking the

155
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,120
acetammenophen dose this four grams for

156
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,880
example for 10 days in a row if you're

157
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,720
taking it while after you're drinking

158
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,240
alcohol because the alcohol does some

159
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,320
irritating as well or if you got a

160
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,560
history of liver problems to begin with.

161
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,919
Now I think the best way to sort of

162
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,720
bring this home to a lot of you is to

163
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,120
share the story of a 19-year-old woman

164
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,039
that I have not met Madeline Burn and we

165
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,960
are joined by her mother Evelyn who

166
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,759
knows firsthand about the dangers of

167
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,360
acid defend. Thank you for joining us.

168
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,720
So, could you share with the audience

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,440
what happened to your daughter?

170
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,080
First, I want to say that she was an

171
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,080
incredibly awesome human being. She was

172
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,919
an honor student. She was the drum major

173
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,440
in her high school band. So, she had

174
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,880
trouble with her back. She was in an

175
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,880
auto accident in 2001 and off and on had

176
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,160
back problems. And as most people know,

177
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,840
backpacks at school are very heavy. And

178
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,639
sometimes she would be we would take her

179
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,800
to the doctor and he would you know tell

180
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,560
her to take

181
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,479
acetaminophen and um she would take it

182
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,759
off and on and

183
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,199
um she'd been taking it for

184
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,520
approximately 7 days. We got a call

185
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,840
Sunday. She was fine Saturday, perfectly

186
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,759
fine Saturday. Sunday morning we got a

187
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,880
call that her roommate found her on her

188
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,639
sofa with vomit on her.

189
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,720
By that afternoon, she was on life

190
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,440
support. First thing Monday morning, she

191
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,039
was dead. It happens that fast. It

192
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,479
killed her liver that fast.

193
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,000
Why was it important for you to be here

194
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,440
with us today to share this terrible

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,720
story? Um there there are quite a few

196
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,120
reasons for my husband and I and and my

197
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,560
whole

198
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,479
family. We don't want this to happen to

199
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,039
anybody else. And we we know that she

200
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,599
would not want it to happen. And I can't

201
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,599
really give a lot of meaning to her

202
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,560
death. It to me it was very senseless.

203
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,680
And if you doing this show helps

204
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,400
anybody, then it'll give some meaning to

205
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,639
her life. And with only 19 years, I

206
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,800
mean, I don't get to be a grandmother. I

207
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,240
I don't get to see her get married. My

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,440
husband doesn't get to walk her down the

209
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,520
aisle. And

210
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,199
I know it took a lot to come here. And I

211
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,199
promise you, we will get the word out.

212
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,120
Thank you. Thanks for joining us. Now

213
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,720
that story should be a wakeup call for

214
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
all of us. I want to thank you for being

215

why. I took it almost every day for

aches and pains until I learned the

221
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,960
damage it was doing to my liver. Now I

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,319

[Music]

247
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,040
You're wonderful. Thank you for being

248
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
here. How do you do it all? How do you

249
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,399
juggle all these crazy things you're up

250
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,160
to? Oh, you you know the answer to that

251
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,160
question cuz you do a lot of stuff

252
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,440
yourself. I you know, as I have a wife.

253
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,959
She uh she does she makes all the

254
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,279
important decisions. And your beautiful

255
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,720
daughter Daffhne, who I adore and uh and

256
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,000
congratulations on your grandchild. Um

257
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,720
the best. Yes.

258
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,320
family, you know, uh for me, I basically

259
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,360
I'm a person who likes to have a very

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
full life. Um I'm a visual person and my

261
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,640
husband like was such a fantastic cook.

262
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
So we made a blog together which turned

263
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,600
into a TV show. So now like we're

264
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,360
cooking. We've written a cookbook and um

265
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,800
and you know I I have lots of projects

266
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
going. I love to write. Well, let me

267
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,120
talk about one of your important

268
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
projects. She's got a new role. She's

269
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,040
starring in a TV land show called

270
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,279
Younger. I love your character is

271
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,360
actually encouraging a friend to lie.

272
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,560
What's the biggest lie you've told? Um,

273
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,040
I probably have aged up because back in

274
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,279
the day, um, I wanted to, you know, be

275
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,680
able to go into clubs to work and to be

276
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,839
able to be like feel relevant and grown

277
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,519
up. So, I used to age up. What other

278
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,079
lies have I told? Oh, my resume. Because

279
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,519
before I before the internet happened,

280
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,200
we used to be able to say like, "Oh,

281
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,399
yeah. I was in this great movie or I did

282
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,480
this play. Oh, you haven't seen it, but

283
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,000
I was in this stuff." Now, you can't lie

284
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
anymore. So, that's the worst thing to

285
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
happen to us actors. So Debbie's a

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,920
working mom like most of you. She's got

287
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,120
no time to deal with health problems. So

288
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
she's come up with some easy solutions.

289
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
That's why I want you here. So come on

290
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
over. We're going to start with food

291
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,320
because you've talked about the food

292
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
love you have. Yes. Because the love of

293
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,399
your life makes food. So if you've got

294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,760
no time for healthy meals, this is the

295
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,839
one I want you to make. Go ahead. Walk

296
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,440
us through the the number one solution

297
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,680
you found for healthy meals. Well, what

298
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,720
one thing I like to promote is far. Far

299
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,440
is an ancient grain. The truth. Far or

300
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,440
farro, but it's far with a double R. And

301
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,680
fau is like used by the atruskins, the

302
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,279
Romans used in the Mediterranean. So

303
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,279
it's kind of like a rice or like a

304
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,680
buckwheat. It's got incredible nice sort

305
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,120
of a nutty rounded flavor. And it's

306
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,959
really easy to use. Store in your

307
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,200
refrigerator. You basically make it. It

308
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,600
takes about 30 to 40 minutes to cook.

309
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,600
You rinse it. You dress it with olive

310
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,800
oil, salt, and pepper. And it can be

311
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,000
reused into soups, into as a side dish.

312
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
We have a soup here. We have a soup

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,040
here. So that if you want it to be a

314
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,279
little more hearty cuz soup is also nice

315
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,600
and dietetic. You have your proteins in

316
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,360
there. You add a little bit of far and

317
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,399
um boom. Like it's But this is the

318
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,440
salad, right? The foundation you're

319
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,920
going to make us. And you could just

320
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,240
like toss the far in. I'm going to use

321
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,040
all of it. Just dump it in there. And

322
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,760
then I have some uh nice cherry tomatoes

323
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,600
and some fresh burata or mozzarella. And

324
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,720
it's just nice in the summer time. Don't

325
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
dump all those in there because it might

326
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,320
be not not too many for this. Let's see.

327
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,800
How do you know what's the right amount?

328
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,600
It Well, you eyeball. It's a taste. So

329
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,800
here, just Okay. Put Put a couple in.

330
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,399
important decisions I don't get to make

331
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,920
anymore. All right. Half of it, you

332
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,399
think? Is that too much? Do half. And

333
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,320
then extra virgin olive oil. You take uh

334
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,240
some fresh um basil and uh and then like

335
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,480
toss it, you know, toss it. I'm a good

336
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,240
tosser. Great. You toss it up. Then when

337
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,760
you add the olives in there, I know. Oh,

338
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,519
the olives. Absolutely. So, this is like

339
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,279
a little bit of a capras. You add the

340
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,120
olives. And this is great cuz it's got

341
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,800
cheese and the fo is like is almost like

342
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,760
a rice. How many of you have heard of

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
farro before? Farro. Oh, a couple. How

344
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,560
many of you going to try it now? Because

345
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,000
you saw they've demonstrated more

346
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,680
people. Good. All right. Now, come on

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,720
over here. Got problem number two. I've

348
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,320
got a little props for you. You brought

349
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,839
this from home. Oh, yes. It's a little

350
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,279
gift you brought to show. The second

351
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,360
problem we don't have any time for is

352
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,920
these guys. Take a look at this picture.

353
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,959
You all know what that is.

354
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,760
Gross. They're lice. Yeah. Who has no

355
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,440
time for lice? Yep. There you go. You

356
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,839
know, lice is a clean problem because

357
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,440
lice like clean hair, by the way. No,

358
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,120
like my kids are in public school and

359
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,040
it's funny because like it's a problem

360
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,720
and like then the whole house has to get

361
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,000
checked and so I actually hired a

362
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,279
nitpicker. Nitpickers. I thought like I

363
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,560
thought you like are picking on me but

364
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,320
your spouse is usually a nitpicker. The

365
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,920
spouse is Well, it turns out nitpickers

366
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,760
are hired people. Then that's all they

367
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,800
do is pick out knits and like come on.

368
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,720
Are you serious? And they actually

369
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,800
brought this one to me. It's clean by

370
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,720
the way. Okay. Um these are super tiny

371
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
teeth. And what we do is we like you

372
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,600
know do your hair. I take a bunch of

373
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,240
conditioner or oil. You want to drown

374
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,240
them because they breathe lice. So, you

375
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,680
have to suffocate them and you have to

376
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,120
comb it out with the conditioner and

377
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,920
like you have to do it several times

378
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,279
during the week. This is garlic extract.

379
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,200
It turns out that they don't like

380
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,760
garlic. I've been told and you want to

381
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,839
put it around the hairline. Okay. Do a

382
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,760
demonstration. Please do. Take it away.

383
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,040
I cannot believe this works. I've never

384
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,560
heard of garlic. Actually, I've heard of

385
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,560
not wearing the same helmet. Someone

386
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,880
Earbuds, by the way. Earbuds can pass

387
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,800
lights along even simple things like

388
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,800
that. Sure. So, basically, you just want

389
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,920
to take a little drop on your hand and

390
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,760
you want to rub it behind the around the

391
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,240
hairline behind the ear. Now, this

392
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,839
garlic, not a lot. Turn. And you want to

393
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,399
go all the way around. That's right. She

394
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,920
was a stylist. I forgot. Turn. You smell

395
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,560
like a pizza now, by the way. Now, yes.

396
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,320
Now, the smell the smell does go away.

397
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,000
Like, trust me, I have two daughters and

398
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,839
they would like not be having it if they

399
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,320
smelled like garlic, even though they

400
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,600
are Italian. But, um, so now and you

401
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,120
want to just go around the hairline. You

402
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
want to keep the hair pulled back in a

403
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,600
braid when there's a lace outbreak at

404
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,839
school. Julie, thank you very much. Hope

405
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,360
it's helpful for your kids. Thanks for

406
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,519
being game. All right, there's one last

407
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,959
problem we're going to get, Phil.

408
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
Problem number three is none of us have

409
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,079
time for wrinkles. So, what do you do

410
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,920
about your wrinkles? One thing that I

411
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,240
like to do is I have an avocado that's

412
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,279
going bad. I squeeze some lemon in the

413
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,600
avocado cuz this is brightening. I take

414
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,920
a coffee beans. I grind them up and I

415
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,440
make a really nice mixture. What I do

416
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,720
with this is I take it and I rub it on

417
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,800
my skin. The avocado oil actually is

418
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,079
wonderful on the skin. You can put a

419
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,519
little bit of olive oil in there as

420
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,720
well. I like the lemon because it's got

421
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,839
like kind of like a bleaching component.

422
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,360
You could eat the leftovers. Probably

423
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,360
you could eat the leftovers. You could

424
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,639
put this in your hair minus a coffee

425
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,560
bean. Like does it help with the lice

426
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,760
too? Probably not. Probably not. They

427
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,680
might want to eat it or something. This

428
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,480
is a picture of Debbie with the mask on.

429
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,440
She's brave enough to

430
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,120
allow that. Are you not wearing

431
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,959
anything? Are we to show that picture?

432
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,680
Um, actually I have on a strapless

433
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,880
bikini cuz I was on camera. Now you want

434
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:35,399
you want me to put this on your face.

435
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,240
All right. Why not? Yeah, why not?

436
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,160
So, what I want to do is let's put this

437
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,720
here just a little bit so we don't get

438
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,560
We'll just do one side. And what you're

439
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,440
going to realize is that like see if I

440
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,279
go like this, you feel how the coffee.

441
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,440
So that's exfoliating. It's great. So,

442
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,040
between the olive oil and, you know, the

443
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,199
You can do both sides. I can. No, I'm

444
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,199
kidding. Can I get the worst show? It

445
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,639
feels really good though. Yeah. And so,

446
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,720
there you go. I'm going to just do a

447
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,160
little bit right here. I mean, I would

448
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,240
coat it more, but you know, then you're

449
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,600
going to be a mess. You have to go

450
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,759
backstage, but like, see, like this. And

451
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,320
then you leave it on. What I do is I sit

452
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,560
like in the bathtub and I have a nice

453
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,759
glass of wine, a book, and I cover my

454
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,079
entire body because I used to have an

455
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,680
avocado tree when I lived in LA. So, I

456
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,440
would give all the avocados away. what

457
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,120
was left over I would keep using in my

458
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,360
salad and then the excess I would make

459
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,040
like a full body thing and then you just

460
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,279
jump into the shower and you're it's

461
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,560
like you're like silky.

462
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,320
I shake your Well, I can't shake your

463
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,079
hand.

464
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,759
You can check out Debbiey's new show,

465
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:38,519
Younger. It premieres Tuesday, March

466
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,519
31st on TV Land. We'll be right back.

467
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,399
[Applause]

468
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,320
Coming up next, do you enjoy the

469
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,240
occasional glass of wine with friends?

470
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
But has it become a nightly habit? If

471
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,560
wine is a crutch to relieve stress,

472
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,560
something in your life may be broken.

473
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,240
The plan to control drinking that can

474
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,240
lead to a problem. Coming up

475
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,360
next, many of us enjoy a glass of wine

476
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,039
or two with friends. It's sociable. It's

477
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,360
relaxing. It's good, good thing to do.

478
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,280
But what happens when wine becomes your

479
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,439
crutch, your stress reliever, your

480
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,319
comfort device, and something you can't

481
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,160
go a night

482
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,400
without? Over the years, Melissa has

483
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,880
developed a ritual with wine. After a

484
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,439
hard day's work and dinner is done, she

485
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,000
settles in to relax with TV and a glass

486
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:30,160
of wine. But that one glass can become

487
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,400
two or three, even a whole bottle. And

488
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,960
that has Melissa's family and friends

489
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,160
worried about her

490
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,120
health. Melissa and I have been friends

491
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,840
for 5 years. We definitely bond and

492
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,600
enjoy a glass of wine together. She's a

493
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,160
great person. She's a great mother.

494
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,080
She's a great friend, but I have noticed

495
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,240
that Melissa's drinking has increased

496
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,960
over the years. I think her habit

497
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,840
started with her ex-husband and has

498
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,880
increased after the divorce. Just the

499
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,000
daily life of being a single mom and

500
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,240
raising three kids by herself. It's not

501
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,679
easy. I have told my mother that I think

502
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,080
she drinks too much. That can't be

503
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,559
healthy for anyone. One time I was

504
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,640
talking to her about her drinking and we

505
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,440
got into a really big argument about it

506
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,120
that lasted for a few hours. I think

507
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,120
Melissa relies too much on having a

508
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,400
glass of wine at the end of the day to

509
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,400
relax and relieve her stress.

510
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,559
You okay, Melissa? Yes.

511
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,320
It's on the surface, isn't it? When you

512
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,799
see your family talking about you. Yep,

513
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,080
it is.

514
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:39,200
So, people who love you think this is

515
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,720
becoming an issue. I understand that. If

516
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,160
you don't mind, I'd love you to describe

517
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,679
your relationship with wine and and what

518
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,559
was it like to hear them talking about

519
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,280
that relationship. Um, they're right.

520
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,039
It's a crutch, you know, and it's

521
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,840
probably not healthy for me.

522
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:58,799
Um, but I enjoy it, you know. That's my

523
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,320
way of at the end of the day taking, you

524
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,919
know, a breath and just breathing. And

525
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,120
it just makes me feel better for the

526
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,400
moment.

527
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,320
When did you start the drink? About 15

528
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,039
years ago after I gave birth to my

529
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,480
second child. Um me and my best friend,

530
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,559
we both had children together and we

531
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,320
were stay at home moms and we would

532
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,880
watch like General Hospital on a you

533
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,039
know together and she brought over a

534
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,559
bottle of white Dendel. So that's how I

535
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,480
got introduced to it and that's when I

536
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,720
started. I mean I didn't drink every day

537
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,360
back then you know that was just for fun

538
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,919
in the beginning but it progressed.

539
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,760
What's the trigger now? Get you to take

540
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,720
that first glass of wine. It's just

541
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,720
every day. It's just I feel like every

542
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,840
day is the same routine over and over

543
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,360
again. You know, you got to get up with

544
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,799
the kids. You got to take the kids to

545
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,320
school. Then I got to come home and I

546
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,240
got to get ready for my work, you know,

547
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,080
and then to pick the kids up to come

548
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,160
home, cook dinner. It's the same thing

549
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,559
every day and it's just stress. It's

550
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,320
stressful. So, is the is the wine a

551
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,120
reward or is it the crutch that your

552
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,600
friends think it is? Um, I believe

553
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,919
sometimes I look at it as it is my

554
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,760
reward. You know, it's me saying, "I

555
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,840
deserve this. I worked hard today. I'm

556
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,640
entitled to sit down and have a drink,

557
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,440
you know, and it makes me feel good."

558
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,600
And your friend commented on the role of

559
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,960
your your husband, your divorce. Mhm.

560
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,960
And the the way you were feeling back

561
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,720
then when that first separation became

562
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,360
apparent. I was scared. I was petrified.

563
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,240
And you know, I started to drink more

564
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,640
because it was helping me subside my

565
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,240
feelings for the moment. Subside the

566
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,200
feelings. Yeah. But I mean, you would

567
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,039
still get up every morning and they were

568
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,039
there, but it would help me to, you

569
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,320
know, not think about it for the moment.

570
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,919
How does it do that? How's how does it

571
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,280
help you subside the feeling? How does

572
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,679
it help you cope? It just relaxes me. I

573
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,760
don't think about anything. I just I veg

574
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,400
out. I do my thing and I just relax. It

575
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,919
just I just breathe, I guess. I don't

576
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,200
know.

577
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,360
Well, breathing simply you ought to be

578
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,880
able to do all the time the wine. Yeah.

579
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,679
See, I think the wine is putting a

580
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,960
blanket over your emotions.

581
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,960
That's not the same thing as dealing

582
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,640
with them

583
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,919
and they're so, you know, inside of you

584
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,799
percolating looking for a way to express

585
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,559
themselves. So, we heard from your

586
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,480
family and friends who obviously love

587
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,159
you and, you know, and they see your

588
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
nightly wine routine as concerning to

589
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,760
them. So, we followed that ritual from

590
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,880
their point of view. I wanted to follow

591
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,080
you with your perspective. So, you let

592
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
us kindly into your house. What we did

593
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,520
was visit Melissa with cameras and a

594
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,039
member of my medical team to see how the

595
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,640
wine was affecting her. Take a look. Hi.

596
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,120
Hey. How are you? Nice to meet you. Nice

597
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,720
to meet you, too.

598
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,159
So, I'm just here tonight to monitor

599
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,760
your drinking. Occasionally, I'll pull

600
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,320
you aside for some testing, but

601
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,760
otherwise, I'm just a fly on the wall.

602
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,159
It's the end of the night. I just put

603
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,080
the kids to bed. Now, it's time for me.

604
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,060
It's mommy time. I just want to sit back

605
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,720
and I just want to

606
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:56,080
[Music]

607
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:59,039
relax. I just finished my first glass of

608
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,640
wine and I'm feeling relaxed. So, right

609
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,240
now I'm going to give you a breathalyzer

610
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,400
test. Take a deep breath and blow out

611
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,529
for 2 seconds into this hole. It's

612
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,529
[Music]

613
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,400
04. What I'm going to do now is test

614
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,559
your coordination. Raise your right leg

615
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,400
and then count upward to a thousand. You

616
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,100
walk heel to toe and keep your hands by

617
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:27,069
your

618
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,069
[Music]

619
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,880
side. I just finished my third glass.

620
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,320
I'm tired.

621
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,120
07. I'm ready for

622
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,720
bed. Good night.

623
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,640
interventionist and former addict

624
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,400
herself, Christina Wanzel is joining

625
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,000
us. So Melissa, by the end of the night,

626
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,720
you had the three glasses of wine and

627
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,440
that breathalyzer test, you got a 07.

628
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,880
Yes. If you're driving in a car at a 08.

629
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,480
I wouldn't be driving in a car. You

630
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,080
wouldn't? No. Once I'm home and I know

631
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,919
I'm going to have a I don't drive even

632
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,400
if I have a glass of wine. I won't go

633
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,280
anywhere. Good for you. Good for you. I

634
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,679
only point that out to the audience

635
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,440
because at 08 it's a DUI, right? Uh but

636
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,440
it also to me is a point at which all of

637
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,640
us in medicine sort of say you're not

638
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,000
yourself anymore, right? So that sends a

639
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,640
signal to me that you're sort of living

640
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
on the edge. Do you think you're on the

641
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,000
edge of danger at the border? Probably.

642
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,000
And is that something that you are you

643
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,120
striving to stay on that edge? No.

644
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,280
That's almost a byproduct of all this.

645
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,679
So you're not harming others? I don't

646
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,320
think not yet. But I worry about you

647
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,120
harming yourself and the message that

648
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,880
you're sending out. So I think when you

649
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,320
go into these boundary areas, we just

650
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,640
need to have an open conversation about

651
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,840
what impact it could have. So if you

652
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,520
don't drink, if you didn't have that

653
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,440
first drink or the second or the third,

654
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,200
what would happen?

655
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,520
Well, first of all, it helps me to sleep

656
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,840
at night. So if I don't have a couple

657
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,240
glasses of wine, I can't sleep. I just

658
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,559
can't sleep. So I like to also have a

659
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,039
couple so I can sleep.

660
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,880
So, it's soothing you, right? Helping

661
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,520
you cope. You know, you're getting close

662
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,640
to a boundary, but you don't go out.

663
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,600
Christristie, let me go to you. How do

664
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,919
you can you tell the difference between

665
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,679
someone who's a social drinker and

666
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,600
someone who's an alcoholic? Well, first

667
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,400
of all, social drinking is actually

668
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,159
social uh when you're out or with

669
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,320
friends and you're sharing time with

670
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,520
people. So, so social drinking is a

671
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,279
social event. Habitual drinking is doing

672
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,760
something every day, maybe not knowing

673
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,960
why we do it or not. And then addiction

674
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,200
of course is moving into the the feeling

675
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,679
that I can't do without it. And of

676
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,200
course I think the hallmark is how your

677
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,799
relationship with alcohol when we look

678
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,640
at addiction how your relationship with

679
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,960
alcohol or any substance is affecting

680
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,679
other members in your family or in your

681
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,440
or you know in your social life. I do I

682
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,600
also want to say that you do not have to

683
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,960
get in a car to cause damage with

684
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,279
alcohol. Right? That's one piece of it.

685
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,480
And frankly, with all due respect, you

686
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,960
don't know if you're going to get in a

687
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,200
car or not. I mean, you don't plan on

688
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,440
it, but it's the unplanned events that

689
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,360
really change lives in catastrophic and

690
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,520
profound ways. So, if there was some

691
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,960
sort of event or some sort of emergency,

692
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,559
you actually are unfit to drive. And I

693
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,559
think more importantly, what happens

694
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,279
with a relationship with alcohol is it

695
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,520
becomes a relationship in your life. It

696
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,000
is what is between you and the rest of

697
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,679
your family members. It becomes a more

698
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
significant relationship in your life

699
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,640
than the people around you. It doesn't

700
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,520
mean you don't love the people in your

701
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:39,039
life. It just means that alcohol or that

702
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,279
relationship is first and that's how

703
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,200
children are affected.

704
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,200
Does that make sense to you? Yes. You

705
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,039
understand what I'm how that makes

706
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,559
sense? Yes, I do. Does it resonate with

707
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,240
you? Do you see yourself in any of those

708
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,080
three categories? So, as I heard you,

709
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,880
there's the social drinkers, which is

710
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,400
social with people. There's the habitual

711
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,840
drinkers, people who want to have their

712
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,640
glass of wine because it's part of their

713
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,919
routine. Then people who are alcoholics.

714
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,760
Which category would you put yourself

715
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,799
in? I don't want to put myself

716
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,440
in any of them. I don't know. Um,

717
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,520
probably an alcoholic.

718
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,320
Christine, let me go to you. I think

719
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,400
that if you feel that you're alcoholic,

720
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,480
it is something to pay attention to.

721
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,000
Alcoholism isn't generally something you

722
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,360
wake up in. It's something that you

723
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,600
slide into.

724
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,080
you kind of arrive into the disease like

725
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,520
all other great

726
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,840
diseases and that's what's happening to

727
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,840
you right it what I hear you saying is

728
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,360
that you're sliding toward a

729
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,720
very

730
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,840
significant profound and lifealtering

731
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,960
disorder I want you to know how

732
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,840
incredibly brave I think you are because

733
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,080
you are like so many women my practice

734
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,400
is filled with people just like you

735
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,240
beautiful articulate educated ated high

736
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,320
functioning moms running households,

737
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,000
working in businesses, raising children,

738
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,279
sometimes alone, sometimes with somebody

739
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,520
else. It's a busy life and we live in a

740
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,400
culture that is entitled to taking the

741
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,520
edge off. You are doing what we are

742
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,480
trained to do. It takes the exceptional

743
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,080
person to ask the hard questions. And I

744
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,600
love that you talk about being nervous

745
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,360
about the answer because what that tells

746
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,919
me is that you're on the precipice of a

747
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,000
great truth. Listen, you want to change?

748
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,520
Yes, I do. All right. So, when we come

749
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,360
back, we got a plan to cut back on

750
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,030
whatever drinking it is before it

751
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:37,080
becomes a problem. Stay with

752
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:39,760
[Music]

753
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,520
us next. There's nothing wrong with a

754
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,360
glass of wine to relax, but when it

755
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,520
becomes your crutch, it could get out of

756
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,279
control. Stop using wine to blanket your

757
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,120
emotions and identify what triggers you

758
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,039
to drink. The plan to replace your

759
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,640
nightly wine ritual with new ways to

760
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,720
de-stress. Coming up, Barbara Streryan,

761
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,039
her fight against the number one killer

762
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,360
in women. One out of three of you will

763
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,679
die of it. And the moment she never

764
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,919
expected, oh my god. Next, Oz. That's

765
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,960
coming up

766
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,960
tomorrow. There's nothing wrong with a

767
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,720
glass of wine to unwind, but when it

768
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,640
becomes your crutch and the only way to

769
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,720
de-stress, it could get out of control.

770
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,880
Today, the plan to cut back on social

771
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,480
drinking before it leads to a problem.

772
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,480
Interventionist and former addict

773
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,080
Christina Wanzel is back, as well as

774
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,320
Melissa, who's currently drinking three

775
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,080
to four glasses of wine a night to

776
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,520
unwind. So, Christina, how do you know

777
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,360
when the drinking of the wine has become

778
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,440
a bigger problem than you think than you

779
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,320
anticipated? I think the greatest thing

780
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,640
to do if anyone out there is questioning

781
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,679
their relationship with alcohol is to

782
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,360
cut it out for say 90 days. I know it

783
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,960
sounds like a long time, but it's the

784
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,120
best way to learn about your

785
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,679
relationship with alcohol. It's a great

786
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,120
social experiment. You get to see the

787
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,120
world that we live in. You know, we live

788
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,799
in this culture where alcohol is just

789
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,399
part of it. Honestly, I pick up my kids

790
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,960
from school and women are talking about

791
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,200
going home and having their wine. It's

792
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,240
acceptable. It's part of it. And it

793
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,120
takes the exception, right? I haven't

794
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,880
had a drink for 21 years. And it t it's

795
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,440
the ex Thank you.

796
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,679
I only share that because it's a gift,

797
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,520
you know, when when we when we learn how

798
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,120
to take care of ourselves without a

799
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,520
substance. And that's the culture we

800
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,840
live in. If you hurt or something's

801
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,360
happening, take something for it. So,

802
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,039
we're going to go into this plan and

803
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,880
just to focus on this issue. We're going

804
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,159
to get people to unwind without having

805
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,200
to use a substance. We're going to focus

806
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,720
on wine because it's one of the ones

807
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,880
we're using a lot more. Food we used to

808
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,279
be in this category. Wine's quickly

809
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,120
catching up. So, like a lot of folks, I

810
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,039
think you're drinking your feelings. You

811
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,480
think I'm accurate when I say that? Yes.

812
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,000
Right. So, when we drink our feelings,

813
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,159
we don't allow those feelings to become

814
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,520
a weapon for us to allow us to be who we

815
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,120
can be. So, the first step of this plan

816
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,000
for everybody out there is to keep a

817
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,600
drinking diary to uncover your trigger

818
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,799
emotions. So, please, Christina, walk us

819
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
through what this is and why it's so

820
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,720
important. You're not just writing down

821
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,000
that you're drinking, you're writing

822
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,559
down the emotions with it. So, this is a

823
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,559
great thing to do. It's about before you

824
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,559
take the drink or the second drink or

825
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,440
the third drink to sit down for a moment

826
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,840
and consider why you're drinking it,

827
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,080
what you're feeling, what you want to

828
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,320
not feel maybe more importantly. And

829
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,399
even if look, even if you have the drink

830
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,320
after you do the entry, fair enough. All

831
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,440
right, so we're going to put this very

832
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,720
easily downloadable drinking diary on

833
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,919
dr.com. I think it's a good first step

834
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,760
again to connect with why you're

835
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,240
drinking. Second big issue is to replace

836
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,640
one glass of wine every night with a

837
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,159
social interaction. If it's truly social

838
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,480
drinking, you should be able to make

839
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,320
that reality occur. So, Christina, walk

840
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,520
us through this. Send an email to a

841
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,559
friend or uh call your dad who I know

842
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,799
that you're close to. Or go visit a

843
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,480
neighbor. What would you do to replace

844
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,480
one glass of wine? What social

845
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,480
interaction?

846
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,200
Well, my favorite person to talk to is

847
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,279
my best friend in Pennsylvania. Fine.

848
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,520
Call call Pennsylvania. That becomes

849
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,360
Listen, these are small steps. Don't

850
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,960
cost anything that you can do every day

851
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,559
because you drink wine every day. So,

852
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,520
we're not looking for magical solutions

853
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,720
here. We're looking for practical

854
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,799
everyday solutions for you and everybody

855
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,240
at home. Whereas, again, whether you're

856
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,679
social or more of a drinker. All right.

857
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,080
Come on over here. I've got another step

858
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,640
for you. Okay. You can actually replace

859
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,840
the ritual completely. So, you actually

860
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,480
like to take the wine you say because

861
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,159
you like to get to sleep. Yes. It's a

862
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,480
big deal for you. Yes. To get you there.

863
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,960
Yeah. So instead of wine, I recommend

864
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,039
tart cherry juice. Let me explain. You

865
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,200
like the tannins of wine, the tartness

866
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,440
of it. Yes. Right. This has tannins in

867
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,679
it. This actually also has melatonin in

868
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,960
it, which is a natural substance that's

869
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,720
going to let your brain realize it's

870
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,080
night time, time to go to bed. These

871
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,960
type of replacements might get that

872
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,960
iconic feel of

873
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,440
this without the impact of the wine.

874
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,919
Yes. Okay. These are small things done,

875
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,919
right? And it'll get you to sleep. So,

876
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,080
you seem skeptical to me, which I'm

877
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,039
happy you are because a lot of folks

878
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,919
watching at home are probably thinking

879
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,480
it's too easy to do it this way. What do

880
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,600
you think will work for you? I got to

881
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,919
I'm going to take it slow. I want to

882
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,960
take it a step at a time. I, you know, I

883
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,120
want to adjust to changes. It's a change

884
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,360
for me cuz I'm used to doing this every

885
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,600
night, you know. Is this scary for you?

886
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,279
It's very scary because it's a change

887
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,640
again.

888
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,799
Is the change scaring you? the

889
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,399
possibility that you're slipping into a

890
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,039
darker place with the alcohol than you

891
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,159
thought.

892
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,039
I don't know. I don't know. I I think I

893
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,440
can do this. So maybe I'm not falling

894
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,360
into that darker place. I don't want to.

895
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,279
That's the whole thing. Yeah. I know you

896
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,440
can do this. I don't just think I know

897
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,880
you can. And there are millions of folks

898
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,279
just like you are wondering how they can

899
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,480
put their life together without all this

900
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,240
happening, whether it's food or alcohol

901
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,559

924
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:40,640
[Applause]

925
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,600
right? Sometimes the first step towards

926
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,919
healing is to ask what if. So today I'm

927
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,240
asking all of you, what if, for example,

928
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,440
what if you didn't have back pain? How

929
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,880
would your life be different? What would

930
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,880
you be able to do? And that's exactly

931
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,480
what I asked our studio audience before

932
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,799
the show. They went out there and they

933
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,320
pinned their answers to the place where

934
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,559
it hurts the most. Notice the lower

935
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,440
back. A lot of little uh posters here.

936
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,200
These are a couple of them, by the way.

937
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,039
Kristen said that she would take dance

938
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,760
lessons or she actually start dancing

939
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,200
again. Kyifira over here said that she

940
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,079
wanted to play with her daughter with

941
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,599
her kids. And Tanya, look at that one.

942
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,000
sex with exclamation points. She says,

943
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,359
"You want have more sex." Today, I'm

944
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,240
gonna have all of you make all these

945
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,079
things happen. I'm gonna start with

946
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,440
Tanya because of that provocative post.

947
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,639
I want to help her get back in action

948
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,159
right away. Hi, how are you? Thank you

949
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,520
for putting up here what most people

950
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,159
don't. Some people, you know, present

951
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,639
marathons, walk the dogs, but sex was

952
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,320
Definitely. Definitely. I hear that

953
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,320
excuse a lot. The back pain. I can't

954
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,079
have sex. It's really not an excuse. My

955
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,280
back really does hurt, Dr. Well, I'm

956
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,800
sure your back hurts, but would it

957
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,399
change how intimate you are if you

958
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,919
didn't have the pain? Absolutely. I

959
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,079
think I could do a little more. And what

960
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,159
have you done for it? Well, rest, you

961
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,079
know, sit and try to just keep

962
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,320
everything, you know, lay down and

963
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,760
relax, but it's not working. All right.

964
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,240
So, the rule of thumb, everybody, when

965
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,599
you hurt your back, don't delay getting

966
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,760
back into action because it will delay

967
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,359
your recovery. Oh, okay. So, one day you

968
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,480
get to take off and of course, don't go

969
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,680
out and run marathons when you come

970
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,680
back. Just do things that are rational,

971
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,200
but get back to daily activities. is

972
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,640
more quickly you can do that your body

973
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,640
will compensate and take you through it

974
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,839
and help you cope. So just don't lie

975
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,119
there. Okay, you're right. I probably

976
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,320
should I probably shouldn't say just

977
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,640
don't lie there. I should use different

978
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,240
phrases, but yes,

979
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,160
maybe with your post. Thank you very

980
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,920
much. No problem. Thanks. All right,

981
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,599
let's go back to the what if wall. Let's

982
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,599
go back to Ky. She talked about wanting

983
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,830
to play with her kids. Where's Kyira?

984
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,480
Come on down.

985
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:34,320
[Music]

986
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,560
It's a great pleasure to How How old are

987
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,560
the kids? My daughter, she's eight years

988
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,640
old. You have an eight-year-old? Yes.

989
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,839
That's a good time to play. Very active.

990
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,839
You have to wrestle them down at that

991
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,079
age. Yes. The daughter's a little easier

992
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,359
in boys, by the way. Yes. All right. So,

993
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,880
what games would you play with them if

994
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,720
you didn't have the back pain? Oh, she's

995
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,720
on the track team. So, and I used to run

996
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,440
track. So, I would run track with her. I

997
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,240
would love to take her ice skating,

998
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,359
rollerblading, you know, just do those

999
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,079
active things with her. Come on over.

1000
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,079
I'm going to show something with you.

1001
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,440
It's called myofascial release. It's one

1002
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,200
of the most effective ways to get rid of

1003
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,720
the pain at home. See these little

1004
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,240
rollers here? You've probably seen them

1005
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,079
in stores. This is how you use them.

1006
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,720
They cost almost nothing. By the way,

1007
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,240
you have membranes around the muscles,

1008
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,520
the casing around the sausage. Think of

1009
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,599
it that way. That little plasticky kind

1010
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,280
of thing. You need to loosen that up and

1011
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,880
allow that restricted motion to

1012
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,079
therefore open and it'll take care of

1013
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,079
your discomfort. So, I'll show you how

1014
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,480
to do it. So, sit down on top of this

1015
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,480
with your buttocks. Okay. Okay. And then

1016
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,240
you can use your feet to balance you and

1017
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,520
you're going to slide this roll behind

1018
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,079
your back.

1019
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,359
there. And then depending on how much

1020
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,240
discomfort you have, you're going to

1021
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,480
roll like this with your elbows. Yep.

1022
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,160
You keep your elbows on the roll and

1023
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,160
move your back back and forth on there.

1024
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,520
Now, as you get better at this, you can

1025
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,520
actually stretch your legs out and put

1026
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,800
more weight on your back. You do this

1027
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,800
with your daughter, by the way. She'll

1028
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,200
love it, too. She wants to do this all

1029
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,320
the time. That's the problem.

1030
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,079
Well, now you'll be able to keep up with

1031
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,160
her. I love it. Thank you. Take it with

1032
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,800
you. It's all yours. Thanks, guys.

1033
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,079
And finally, let me get the one last one

1034
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,839
we had over there in the wall. Kristen,

1035
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,760
where's Kristen? She's here. Come, come

1036
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,359
on over. How are you? Now, you wrote

1037
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,960
that you wanted to take dance lessons.

1038
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,560
Yes, I actually used to dance. Tap,

1039
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,640
jazz, ballet, even have my undergraduate

1040
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,480
degree in dance. Is that you dancing?

1041
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,160
Uh, yes, that is me dancing. One heck of

1042
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,760
a get up. Yes. What were you dancing in?

1043
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,000
Uh, actually, I was competing for Miss

1044
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Ohio America. Congratulations. Thank

1045
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,839
you. So, do you have a partner you dance

1046
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,960
with? No. I was hoping you would be my

1047
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,160
partner. Well, if we can deal with your

1048
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,119
back pain, we'll dance away off the set.

1049
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,560
How's that? All right, sounds good. All

1050
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,839
right, so the solution number three, one

1051
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,680
that I really like a lot, probably my

1052
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,680
favorite, is called the TENS therapy.

1053
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,760
So, can I do it with you? Sure. The TENS

1054
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,280
stands for transcutaneous electrical

1055
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,960
nerve stimulation. There's no quiz on

1056
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,400
this. It's a very simple concept, but

1057
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,480
it's incredibly powerful. It blocks the

1058
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,240
pain with waves of relaxing pulses that

1059
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,920
penetrate into your skin. So, our

1060
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,240
trusted sponsorship partner, Icy Hot,

1061
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,000
makes a smart relief TENS therapy

1062
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,440
device, which I'm allowed to try on you

1063
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,760
if you're up for it. Yes. All right. So,

1064
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,280
get comfortable. Pretend you fell while

1065
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,359
dancing. You're on your That's happened

1066
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,960
before. So, get comfortable and just,

1067
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,240
you know, you can sort of relax your

1068
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,599
back a little bit there. Okay. So, I'm

1069
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,320
going to expose your back if you don't

1070
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,480
mind. So, you obviously we all have

1071
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,160
spines. So, these are the pads you'll

1072
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,480
place on one side of the spine or the

1073
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,160
other. They they look like this when you

1074
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,320
take them out of the package. And they

1075
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,320
have a plastic that they're adhered to.

1076
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,920
You pull them off. And they got on the

1077
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,119
back of them have sticking material. You

1078
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,280
can sort of feel my finger sticking to

1079
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,280
it or see it. All right. And then in the

1080
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,320
middle, it'll instruct you where to

1081
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,680
place them. You don't want to place it

1082
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,400
over the spine. You place it on one side

1083
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,359
of the spine. So, for example, in your

1084
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:33,359
case, I place it like

1085
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:35,359
that. Do you feel it there? Mhm. Okay.

1086
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,880
And then once it's on there, expose that

1087
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,520
if you don't mind. Uh, I'm going to turn

1088
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,720
this

1089
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,079
on. As it turns on, you're going to

1090
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,760
start feeling there's a little green

1091
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,720
light that went on. Now, you can

1092
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,640
actually turn it on and then increase or

1093
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,680
decrease the amplitude. So, I'm going to

1094
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,680
increase it a little bit. Do you feel

1095
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,359
the little electricity going in there?

1096
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,720
Yes, a little bit. So, this is

1097
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,359
technology. Is it enough or you want

1098
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,880
some more? You can do more. Okay. So,

1099
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,400
doctors use this technology. Physical

1100
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,640
therapists use it quite a bit. How's

1101
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,320
that about right? Great. Okay. So, the

1102
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,400
nice thing is you can just change the

1103
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,079
intensity as you desire and they've done

1104
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,680
all kinds of cool experiments looking at

1105
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,280
how to randomize the pulses so your body

1106
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,440
doesn't get used to it. You don't need a

1107
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,800
prescription. It's 100% drug free. It's

1108
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,480
portable. You can use it at home. You

1109
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,160
can use it on the go. Describe it to

1110
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,760
everybody what it feels like. Um, it's

1111
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,880
just like a nice little tingly massage.

1112
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,720
It doesn't hurt. It actually feels

1113
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,560
pretty good. The interesting thing about

1114
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,880
this technology is you should get pain

1115
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,000
relief almost

1116
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,160
instantaneously. And it can last hours

1117
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,520
after you've used it. So, it's sort of a

1118
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,720
nice little trick to try in the morning

1119
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,760
before you go to work or if you're going

1120
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,040
to go out in the evening and then you

1121
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,320
don't have to wear it all night long.

1122
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,960
You can if you want, but you don't have

1123
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,800
to. Great. You want another one? Yes,

1124
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,240
please. But that one that one will turn

1125
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,520
off in half an hour and you can turn it

1126
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
back on again, but that's for tomorrow.

1127
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,760
Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you very

1128
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,079
much. Now, let me give you a little some

[Applause]

1141

Next, Dr. Oz, the one. We watch you

1142
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,720
today. The only I'm still a work in

1143
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,599
progress. Barbara Stryen. I want women

1144
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,240
to be powerful. Her passion to fight the

1145
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,320
number one killer in women. One out of

1146
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,560
three of you will die of it. And the

1147
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,079
moment she never expected. Have you ever

1148
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:44,530
held a heart? No, but I'd like to. Oh my

1149
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:47,330
god. Next, Dr. Oz. That's coming up

1150
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:49,240
[Music]

1151
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:51,599
[Applause]

1152
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,440
tomorrow. I've been seeing this quote

1153
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,119
show up on a lot of your Instagram and

1154
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,680
Facebook pages. She believed she could,

1155
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,720
so she did. Think about that. I really

1156
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,480
love how you're embracing this

1157
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,720
philosophy. Makes me think of my wife,

1158
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,920
daughters, even my granddaughter Felo,

1159
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,119
and how they're going to accomplish lots

1160
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,880
of things in their lives. Thinking about

1161
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,960
that mantra. Remember, whether you're

1162
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,880
dealing with an extra 5 lbs or really

1163
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,480
big obstacle, you have the power and

1164
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,480
only you have the power to transform

1165
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,480
thought into action. It all starts with

1166
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,880
believing in yourself. And I'm putting

1167
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,880
this inspirational code up on dr.com.

1168
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,560
Log on and share what you believe you

1169
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,560
could accomplish and what you have done

1170
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,560
and plan to do in the future. Now, it's

1171
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,400
time for in case you missed it. Today, a

1172
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,480
big reality check for those of you who

1173
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,160
lean on wine as a crutch. Many of us

1174
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,240
drink the occasional glass with a nice

1175
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,079
meal when socializing with friends. But

1176
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,680
when you start to need it for stress

1177
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,760
relief and comfort, then things could

1178
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,440
get out of control. So today, we gave

1179
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,119
you a plan to cut back on social

1180
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,880
drinking before it becomes a problem.

1181
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,160
This is unlike any other plan because

1182
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,160
it's going to help you assess your

1183
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,000
relationship with drinking. And a great

1184
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,160
way to gauge that is to keep a drinking

1185
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,359
diary. You can download it on dr.com

1186
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,400
right now. And here's how you're going

1187
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,839
to do it. You're going to write down the

1188
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,079
number of drinks you have every day.

1189
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,920
Next to each one, write down the feeling

1190
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,440
you were having, experiencing. Were you

1191
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,119
sad, happy, stressed? What were you

1192
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,880
feeling when you had the wine? It's

1193
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,079
going to help you identify why using

1194
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,839
this as a crush. Remember, social

1195
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,119
drinking is supposed to be social. So,

1196
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,560
we also gave you the insight that you

1197
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,240
should try to be more social instead of

1198
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,599
drinking. Maybe you can replace one for

1199
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,880
the other. Finally, please be careful of

1200
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,920
dubious people online that make it seem

1201
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,280
like I'm endorsing their products

1202
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,720
because they don't. To see a full list
