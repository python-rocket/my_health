6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,039
Good morning, America. As Robin Roberts

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,279
wakes us up every morning with the

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,840
latest headlines. Well, sometimes a

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,920
story stays with her long after the news

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,399
has been read. And today, Robin is

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,800
revealing one of those true crime ripped

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,160
from the headline stories about a baby

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,320
girl, Kamaya, who was abducted from her

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,239
mother's arms only hours after her

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,800
birth, only to find out 18 years later,

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,199
the woman who raised her isn't really

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,120
her mother at all. Robin exclusively

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,360
interviewed Kamaya and helped turn her

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,600
story into an emotional Lifetime movie.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,600
Please welcome back my good friend Robin

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Roberts.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,759
I still say good morning. Good morning.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,280
How are you? Oh, I love seeing you. Oh,

25
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,600
bless you. Thank you. Look better than

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,759
ever. Hello everyone.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Great to see you.

28
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840
They adore you and so do I. Oh, right

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,880
back at them. There's so many things you

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,759
could talk about. There's so many things

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,240
you do talk about. Get the stories stuck

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,240
for you. What was it? You know, it was

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,479
one of those stories I remember when it

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,240
happened three years ago. And I knew

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,560
that I wanted to know more. So I'm like,

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,720
if I want to know more, do other people

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,960
want to know more? And I knew there was

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,720
more to the story. Let's get into it a

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,320
tiny bit because as I learned about it,

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,240
I was progressively stunned. This, by

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,920
the way, it's like unwrapping an onion.

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,280
I feel like I'm Shrek here talking about

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,719
this. First off, 18 years ago, how how

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
could someone walk into a hospital, take

45
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,399
a baby, and walk out? I don't How did

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,399
that happen? You tell me. You tell me,

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
doctor. It seems impossible to me. I

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,920
know. It does seem impossible. So, it

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,599
was it was 1998, and Gloria Williams was

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,319
a nurse in South Carolina. She drives to

51
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,480
Jacksonville. She's dressed as a nurse.

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,280
She knows what a nurse does. She goes

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,000
into the maternity ward, sees this young

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,720
teenage mother. M the baby was just

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,640
hours old. But this really made national

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,160
news because just as you said, how can

57
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,239
anybody walk into a hospital and walk

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,599
out with a baby? And that's why I was

59
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,120
hearing from mothers who say they put

60
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,560
like little stains on their baby and

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,720
things like that, little things, little

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
markers, so when the baby they know that

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,680
that is their baby. Now it's like Fort

64
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,440
Knox. Babies are locked up. Multiple arm

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,440
wrist. But that's because this was able

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,360
to occur. So in the film, here's how

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,959
you're able to depict how easily this

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,080
could happen. And I was stunned. No,

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,480
what's so different? It says, "You've

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,879
heard of babies getting mixed up, but a

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,879
baby being stolen is something

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,599
different." And when you steal a baby,

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,080
there's often evil intent, a desire to

74
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,720
harm the child for whatever crazy

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,319
reason. What was the excuse for Kamaya

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,200
being taken? Gloria Williams, her

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,680
abductor, was in a relationship with a

78
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,519
man named Charles Mano. It was a bad

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,800
relationship, and she thought having a

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,640
baby would save their relationship. She

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,159
was actually pregnant. She had a

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,840
miscarriage. And so she panicked because

83
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,680
she felt again that she needed a baby.

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,760
Now she claims that she just happened to

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
get in a car, just happened to drive

86
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,239
down to Jacksonville, happened to walk

87
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,480
into that she had no intent. That's that

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,400
what that's what she claimed. But then

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,080
she she did she did come clean and go

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
that was wrong. There's there's no sugar

91
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,360
coating it. Even though she did a

92
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,200
wonderful job in raising Kamaya, who she

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,239
called Alexis, that you you cannot do

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,640
something like this. How is it possible

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,120
that she would go back to her life in

96
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,040
South Carolina with Kamaya and nobody?

97
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
Yeah. And no one knew she was not the

98
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,599
biological child. Because there was

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,519
nothing that this woman had ever done

100
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,879
for people to think that she was capable

101
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,480
of something like this. And you know

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,640
what? She kept a baby bag packed. the

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
first few months because she just knew

104
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,519
I'm going to get found out. Someone's

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,680
going to come and and going to take the

106
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,800
baby. And then years go by and years go

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
by and then it was 16 years in. What

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
does What does What does the kid want to

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,919
do? Wants a job. Right. Yes. Someone the

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
kid wants a job. What do you need?

111
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,720
Social Security card. Thank goodness. I

112
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,720
know. Exactly. Right. And so when she

113
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,000
said she wanted a job, her mother

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,720
panicked and said and came clean. So

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,240
Kamaya actually knew for almost two

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,639
years before authorities were alerted.

117
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,520
Now Kamaya wanted to find out more about

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,840
herself. So she went online. She

119
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,840
actually called her birth mother, hung

120
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,479
up. Now her birthother, we should also

121
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,520
say every single year had a birthday

122
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,680
party. Every single year cut a piece of

123
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,120
birthday cake, put it in the freezer. Oh

124
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,639
my goodness. Believe that she was going

125
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
to see this child again. And that's

126
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,360
what's been so hard

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,000
is that Kamaya has this relationship

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,520
still with her abductor and it's very

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,520
hard for her mother Shinara. Very hard

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,000
uh for her. But can I just say that Ni

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,840
Nash uh Raven Fel um beautiful job

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,080
who play the three principal members

133
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,160
they really bring this story story to

134
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,160
life. C can you share what happens to

135
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,120
the mom the abductor 18 years in prison

136
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,560
she was sentenced 18 years one year for

137
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,400
every year she abducted Kamaya

138
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,199
one year for every year she abducted

139
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,720
her. So she is in jail in Florida and

140
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,479
Kamaya went to see her in December. This

141
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,479
past December for the first time in

142
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,479
three years she went there to the jail.

143
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,520
And so that is very difficult for the

144
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,759
biological mother. She can't wrap her

145
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,919
mind around why her daughter would still

146
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,240
want to have a relationship with this

147
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,000
woman. She's juggling two families, two

148
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,080
families who love her. It's the ultimate

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,800
dilemma in life. And the fact that she

150
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,280
has an abductor and a mother and she's

151
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,120
being torn to not ignore the abductor

152
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,639
who was there for her even though she

153
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,080
should never been in her life for many

154
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,360
years. And there's a part in the in it's

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,600
very emotional clip of the movie, maybe

156
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,440
the most. I mean, it's biblical almost.

157
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,840
You couldn't make up these kinds of

158
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,600
emotional tensions where good and evil

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,680
gets twisted and roped around each

160
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
other. You actually had an opportunity

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,520
to interview Kamaya. What was your

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
takeaway during that? What was very

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,080
important to me after the movie to have

164
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,000
the documentary and the way this

165
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
beautiful young woman is able to share

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,039
her story and I believe there's

167
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,400
something that will resonate with a lot

168
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,240
of people. I love how you elevate all

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
the stories you cover. So be sure to

170
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,560
tune in. Robin Roberts presents Stolen

171
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,479
by My Mother. The Kamaya Moy story

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,160
premieres on Lifetime January the 18th.

173
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,759
And stick around after the feature for

174
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,280
Robin's exclusive interview with Kamaya.

175
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,639
That's the part I really want to see as

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,080
she opens up about her life since her

177
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,360
true identity was exposed. Now, when we

178
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,800
come back, Robin Roberts can talk about

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
a lot of things, but she's going to

180
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,319
share how she's reclaiming her life

181
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,319
after battling health challenges. Stick

182
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,319
around.

183
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,240

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,000
it easy. From the way you eat to how

190
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,720
well you sleep and how you manage your

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,720
stress every day. System 20 for 2020.

192
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:52,240
Yes. Yes, honey. Oh, I feel I feel like

193
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:56,360
Oprah all of a sudden. Like a hug.

194
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,360
Thank you. Thank y'all.

195
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,639
All right. If you want to know who the

196
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,160
real Robin Roberts is, that's her

197
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,680
inspiring the audience during the break

198
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,280
when no one's watching. She didn't have

199
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,440
to do that. But that's what I love about

200
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,360
you. Now, they say sometimes superheroes

201
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,919
don't wear capes. And that phrase may

202
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,440
actually well may be true about Robin

203
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,000
Roberts. You've done so much with so

204
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,039
many ways. I think you deserve Cape

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,960
status. I nominate you for it.

206
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,039
And Robin is here to share her own keys

207
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,639
to resilience after experiencing two

208
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,120
life-threatening illnesses. We've had

209
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,599
many conversations or my wonderful life

210
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,039
with you. Uh but in 2007 when you're

211
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,719
diagnosed with cancer and subsequently

212
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,039
with my plastic syndrome, you went

213
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,800
through a couple combo punches that

214
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,240
would have leveled a lot of folks.

215
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,919
Update everyone. How are you feeling?

216
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,279
How you doing? Oh, uh, praise God. I'm

217
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,440
doing as as well as I am. I am so

218
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,360
incredibly grateful to the doctors, the

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,160
nurses, the technicians who still to

220
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,399
this day keep an eye on me. I do my due

221
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,360
diligence. I go for my regular checkups.

222
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,839
I have started meditating. Um, I watch

223
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,240
what I eat more so than I did before.

224
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,360
Um, all those things that I I I need to

225
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,360
do. But I I just I want to be a symbol

226
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,680
to people that this too shall pass. Uh,

227
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,399
everybody's got really

228
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,120
But but can I tell y'all something? When

229
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,040
I was first diagnosed in 2007 and I'm

230
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,120
seeing the doctors here in New York and

231
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,279
everything, my aunt Foya, may she rest

232
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,800
in peace. She said, "Have you talked to

233
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,480
Dr. Oz yet?" True story. True story. I

234
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
like

235
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,560
I'll get to him. All right. I know him.

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,480
But well, you got to talk to Dr. Oz.

237
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Lived in Akran, Ohio. Yes. Well, as you

238
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,080
often say, everyone's got something and

239
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,519
we forget that we're all in this

240
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,959
together. That's the ultimate safety net

241
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,640
to humanity is being here for each

242
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,959
other. And there's something that you've

243
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,720
been saying that just really touched me.

244
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,320
You said being vulnerable is

245
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,839
therapeutic.

246
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,000
How has that philosophy helped you on

247
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,279
your health journey? Vulnerability. Why

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,200
do we shy away from that? Why do we uh

249
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,080
do that? I I know that when uh Hurricane

250
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,320
Katrina hit and devastated my hometown,

251
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,720
wiped out my hometown of Pastor Shan,

252
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,640
Mississippi, and I was live the next day

253
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,160
from the Gulf Coast, and I had just

254
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,000
joined GMA as a full-time uh host, and

255
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,040
I'm there on the Gulf Coast. Katrina has

256
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,640
blown through, and I cried. I actually

257
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,399
on live television, I couldn't I

258
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,040
couldn't hold it in. I had just found my

259
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,480
mother uh an hour before getting on the

260
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,000
air. I hadn't even known up until that

261
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,120
time. Oh my goodness. If she was alive

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,040
and I wasn't going to go on the air

263
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,320
until I did, but the fact that I cried

264
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,200
and I thought that I was going to lose

265
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,800
my job and just the opposite happened.

266
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
People were like, "Thank you. Thank you

267
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,040
for just being genuine." And it's not

268
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,480
weakness to be vulnerable. That is not a

269
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,079
weakness. Vulnerability. It's so funny

270
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,360
you had that experience. Not funny,

271
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,839
ironic because I was in in Miss in New

272
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,519
Orleans. Oprah had set me down and I got

273
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,600
Oh, look how he dropped that name. No,

274
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
you know, you you saw that. I know. and

275
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,959
I she wanted me to tape for her show and

276
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,240
she went, as you know, to a different

277
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,519
part of the in the uh the aftermath and

278
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,440
I I wasn't as doctory as I was supposed

279
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,959
to be because you couldn't look at at

280
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
what had happened to that beautiful city

281
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,079
that I had visited many times, dead

282
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,399
bodies in the street, floods, you know,

283
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,320
above the bars you'd had parties in

284
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,680
without really feeling it. and not

285
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,680
holding that in actually in many ways

286
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
opened my eyes to the reality that as

287
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,040
doctors we sometimes need to be

288
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,760
vulnerable because our patients are

289
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,600
comfortable telling the truth and it it

290
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,839
goes through and I'm glad you said that.

291
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,320
I mean it's it doesn't matter if you're

292
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,720
a journalist, if you're a doctor, what

293
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,120
walk of life that vulnerability is

294
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,839
something that we all should understand,

295
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,880
respect and embrace. We're hardwired for

296
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,279
it. Yes. Actually speaking of that to

297
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,240
quote

298
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,160
the wonderful philosopher your mom. Oh

299
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,920
who would say make your mess your

300
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,760
message. Make your mess your message.

301
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,680
What is the messenger? Tell us about the

302
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,839
message. Oh my gosh. I remember my mom

303
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,839
first told me that when I was uh

304
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,839
diagnosed with cancer and I was like I

305
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,680
don't what what is the message here? And

306
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,160
it was about early detection because I

307
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,560
found I was triple negative. Um but

308
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,360
because I had through self-detection

309
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,279
found the lump and I just told people

310
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,600
that that um that um early detection it

311
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,079
is not a guarantee um but it just it

312
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,079
increases your chances and so I I got

313
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,160
the message out there but my message has

314
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,680
been and what I've always made my me my

315
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,120
me my message is resiliency to be

316
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,600
resilient to to uh I have this wonderful

317
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,519
little placard in my dressing room I you

318
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
know I often say this too shall pass. It

319
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,000
says this too shall pass dot dot dot.

320
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,920
Now would be good, you know. I guess so.

321
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,839
What do you have in you talked to

322
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,440
everyone who's making news? What's big

323
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,240
for you and GMA over the next couple? Oh

324
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,160
my gosh. We've got the Super Bowl, baby.

325

we're investigating one of the biggest

360
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,720
and most controversial claims. Can CBD

361
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,839
help treat or prevent Alzheimer's? Are

362
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,839
there any real brain benefits?

363
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,440
Can CBD help my chronic CBD make me

364
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,760
skinny? Can CBD help my arthritis, my

365
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,760
indigestion, can my skin problems,

366
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,839
autism, epilepsy, boost my energy? and

367
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,839
CBD help me finally get a good night's

368
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,839
sleep.

369
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,920
All January long, we're investigating

370
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,680
one of the buzziest health topics of

371
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,600
2020, CBD. We've been tracking the trend

372
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,600
from the beginning and answering the 99

373
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,360
CBD questions you're just too afraid to

374
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,079
ask. Today, some of the most

375
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,560
controversial claims about CBD. For

376
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,399
example, can CBD boost your brain health

377
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,800
and improve your memory? and an even

378
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,279
bigger claim. Can it really help prevent

379
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,440
Alzheimer's and dementia? It caught my

380
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,279
attention when I saw the headlines and

381
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,959
the promises made me really skeptical.

382
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,560
So, I wanted to investigate further.

383
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,720
Could it really help someone like my

384
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,959
mom? Could it slow down her progression

385
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,199
of dementia? Or could it help me prevent

386
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,800
it? Here to help uncover the truth is

387
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,959
director of the Alzheimer's Prevention

388
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,560
Clinic in Wild Cornell Medicine, Dr.

389
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,680
Richard Isacson. Good friend.

390
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,440
CBD and Alzheimer's. Is it legit as a

391
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,880
world expert in the space or is it is it

392
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
hype? What does the research say? Well,

393
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,160
we're all here to find out. And I have

394
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,279
no idea. Um, we don't know. The science

395
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,760
doesn't know. I'm not pro CBD. I'm not

396
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,199
anti-CBD. I'm pro- evidence. And right

397
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,199
now, unfortunately, we just don't have

398
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,279
enough evidence to really understand

399
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,959
whether CBD can be helpful for the

400
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,639
treatment of Alzheimer's, for the

401
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,959
treatment of symptoms related to

402
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,639
Alzheimer's, like sleep disturbances and

403
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,480
behavioral complaints, or even in

404
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,320
prevention. We just don't know. The hype

405
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,399
has been so loud that the FDA has

406
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,480
already been warning about CBD products

407
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,639
claiming to treat Alzheimer's. So, I've

408
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
seen headlines about CBD oil and what it

409
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,040
can do for people who already have

410
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,320
dementia. What's been your experience?

411
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,759
What could it do for patients? Right.

412
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
So, I've had several patients that have

413
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,279
decided to try it on their own and they

414
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,720
come back after several months and

415
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,480
honestly, I guess I've seen mixed

416
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,959
results. Um, I don't think I've seen any

417
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,399
harmful um outcomes, but I've seen some

418
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,320
people that subjectively feel better.

419
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,920
Um, I had one patient several weeks ago

420
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,360
that said, you know, I I think he's

421
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,399
sleeping better and and he wakes up in

422
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,000
the morning and maybe he's more

423
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,519
refreshed. I've had other patients that

424
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
have taken, you know, different types of

425
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,199
CBD and, you know, they said, he's

426
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,639
sleeping all the time. So, what I would

427
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,800
say is, you know, from from my personal

428
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,240
experience, it's it's just mixed

429
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,399
results. So, Aby's like you a viewer who

430
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,199
says she's been using CBD oil to help

431
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,920
her mom. Take a look. I am especially

432
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,240
interested in the CBD oil for my

433
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,880
mother's severe anxiety. she is

434
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,199
experiencing due to her dementia. Mom

435
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,600
has been on CBD oil for about four

436
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,560
months and we have seen a slight change

437
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,079
in her anxiety and sleep patterns but we

438
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,639
have not seen an improvement in her

439
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,240
dementia. I hear stories like that all

440
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,839
the time. This there's some things that

441
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,279
got better but not the basic dementia

442
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,399
issues. So when it comes to CBD

443
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,399
products, things that we can actually

444
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,680
buy and give to our loved ones for

445
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,240
dementia or Alzheimer's, where are we

446
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,919
with the data? Right. So I I like that

447
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,400
story because it's a very realistic

448
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,160
story. We tried it. It's a relatively

449
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,079
safe intervention as long as they talked

450
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,839
to the doctor and the doctor approved.

451
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,520
You know, the side effects may be

452
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,360
limited, but is there going to be

453
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,280
benefit? In that case, maybe some of the

454
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,640
symptoms associated with Alzheimer's got

455
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,400
a little bit better. You know, there's

456
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,319
interesting data with with CBD for

457
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,559
sleep, and there's interesting data for

458
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,640
other aspects of brain health, anxiety,

459
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,320
um, even seizures. There's even an FDA

460
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,320
approved drug version of CBD for

461
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,080
seizures. But when it comes to treating

462
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,440
the dementia, the memory, I'm a little

463
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,880
more skeptical. When it comes to

464
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,120
treating the symptoms, I would say

465
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,200
maybe. All right. Another big claim

466
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,720
about CBD is that it can help improve

467
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,000
memory or mental performance. Let's

468
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,240
bring in investigative reporter Mars

469
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
Gavakmpo who's been investigating this.

470
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,520
What kind of products did you find?

471
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,360
Yeah, you know, I went online and in

472
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,320
stores and found a wide variety of

473
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,559
products from CBD capsules to powders

474
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,679
that have other herbs mixed in to oil

475
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,200
tinsters, even bottled drinks. And you

476
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,799
know, these products will make a variety

477
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,120
of claims. They have a lot of buzzwords.

478
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,720
They'll say things like stay sharp,

479
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,960
boost your brain function. They'll even

480
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,720
make really broad claims like optimize

481
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,880
brain health. Those are the things that

482
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
we're seeing. So, you made some calls uh

483
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,480
talked to people who were selling these

484
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,000
CBD products. You're the best at this

485
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
investigative game. So, what do they

486
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,280
yield to you? What do they reveal to

487
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,600
you? Yeah. Six out of the seven stores

488
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,840
that we called said that CBD can help

489
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,480
you with memory function. Some went as

490
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,720
far to recommend specific dosages to

491
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,120
take. And what's most alarming is that

492
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,960
some of them told us that CBD can help

493
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,640
with the early signs and symptoms of

494
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,280
dementia.

495
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,559
See that? This was happening. I think I

496
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,919
and I'm hearing it from my viewers over

497
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,600
and over again. And I don't want to even

498
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,280
call people liars because who the heck

499
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,559
knows? Maybe the right kind at the right

500
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,600
time might make a difference, but we

501
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,039
don't know enough to make those claims.

502
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,640
And that's alarming at six out of seven

503
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,760
shops, you know, bricks and mortar

504
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,160
facilities. Imagine what's going on

505
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,919
online. So, up next, can these products

506
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,480
help you really stay sharper? Or are

507
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,640
they just hype? Well, we tried them to

508
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,640
find out.

509
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:11,039
[Applause]

510
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,280
Jeffrey Epstein. Was it suicide or

511
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,000
murder? The medical examiner that was

512
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,160
inside his autopsy. Plus, the photos

513
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,070
that question how he died. All new OS.

514
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,010
That's coming up tomorrow.

515
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,760
[Applause]

516
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,840
[Music]

517
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,440
We're back investigating 99 questions

518
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,799
about CBD. Can CBD help boost your brain

519
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,880
and improve your memory? One of the

520
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,360
biggest questions I get. Mars Gavakmpo

521
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,000
is here with her 3-day experiment trying

522
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,679
CBD brain products. Yeah, Dr. Oza, I

523
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,840
really wanted to know if these products,

524
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,840
which vary widely in dosages and

525
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,120
ingredients, would help me focus so I

526
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,200
could get through more of my to-do list

527
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,880
and my tasks, especially in the

528
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,679
afternoon when my concentration

529
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,679
generally starts to wne.

530
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,679
I'm going to test three CBD products to

531
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,720
see how they help with things like

532
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,640
memory, sharpness, and focus overall.

533
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,840
The first is a drink. So, you just drink

534
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,799
it up. These are capsules. I'll take

535
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,440
them throughout the day. And lastly,

536
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,799
sublingual drops.

537
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,400
The first product that I'm going to try

538
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,400
are these sublingual drops.

539
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,360
It reminds me of stuff my mom used to

540
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,360
give me as a kid to help me go to the

541
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,360
bathroom.

542
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,640
I've been working now for about 2 hours

543
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,559
straight. This is normally the time of

544
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,880
day where I would want some coffee. I'd

545
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,679
have a little bit of dip in energy. But

546
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,120
I have to say I do feel like I have been

547
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,520
very very focused and very calm. I just

548
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,200
feel at ease. I don't feel frantic, not

549
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,080
jittery.

550
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,760
So, I'm not sure if that is the reason,

551
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,640
but I've had a very productive

552
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,240
afternoon. It's day two, and today I'm

553
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,840
going to drink this before I start my

554
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,440
afternoon busy work.

555
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,520
Well, it definitely tastes a lot better

556
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,919
than that oil. It would be hard to taste

557
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,000
worse than the oil. Um, it really just

558
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,720
tastes like kind of a watered down apple

559
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,200
juice.

560
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,039
So, I've done nothing but procrastinate

561
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
all afternoon

562
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,960
and now I'm backed up because there are

563
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,799
certain things that I have to finish.

564
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,240
So, I'm going to have to kind of plow

565
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:28,000
through them. But, I will say I was not

566
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,440
focused at all this afternoon.

567
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,640
It's day three. Last up,

568
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,960
capsules. Uh, the instructions say take

569
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,960
one to three daily. I'm going to take

570
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,120
three. Again,

571
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,039
I'm taking it before doing the same

572
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,120
tasks, computer work, emails, the boring

573
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,000
stuff.

574
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:55,600
Those capsules absolutely have had a

575
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,640
calming effect on me and they I actually

576
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,679
realized that I'm rushing to do a lot of

577
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,640
things that don't need to be done today.

578
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm not facing any hard deadlines today.

579
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,799
So, I just cut my to-do list in half.

580
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,840
Now, that may not be the most productive

581
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,410
thing, but it does feel really good for

582
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,440
me.

583
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,400
[Music]

584
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,840
Dr. Ro is joining us as well. Mara,

585
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,280
great three-day experiment. What

586
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,440
surprised you the most when you're

587
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,919
looking at CBD? Yeah, what surprises me

588
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,840
is that I really do feel an effect. I've

589
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,480
now tested several products over the

590
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,640
years and I really do believe that they

591
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,280
work, but for me the overwhelming effect

592
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,280
has been to be relaxed, but it doesn't

593
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,679
help me be more productive. I really

594
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,200
felt like I wasn't getting as much done.

595
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,679
Uh Dr. Isacson, you know, we you

596
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,120
discussed dementia, Alzheimer's,

597
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,400
not so sure about that in CBD, but what

598
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,159
about this issue of focus and

599
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,919
concentration, right? So, there's been a

600
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,159
variety of studies that have looked at

601
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,080
um CBD and and mental focus and and

602
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,320
mental clarity. And I think just like

603
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,840
your experiment, different types of CBD,

604
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,000
different ways to drink it, different

605
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,760
doses may really yield different

606
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,280
effects. It also may depend on whether

607
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,120
you take it during the morning or during

608
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,480
the evening. So, I think the data is a

609
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,240
little bit unclear, but I think there's

610
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,480
some promise for it. You've had personal

611
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,159
experience, Dr. Isacson. Yeah. So, I I

612
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,520
um not for prevention of Alzheimer's

613
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,600
disease. I do have family members that

614
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,440
have it. Um but I've actually used CBD

615
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,679
myself for headaches. Um, I have pretty

616
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,679
severe headaches and I actually am on

617
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,039
specific FDA approved drugs and other

618
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,240
treatments, but I talked to my doctor

619
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,000
and I said, "Hey, what do you think

620
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,159
about CBD?" And I decided to try it

621
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,760
myself. Um, just like you, I tried the

622
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,440
drink and I tried the pills and I tried

623
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,520
the gummies and I I literally tried one

624
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,360
of each. And honestly, it took about 10

625
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,840
or 12 different tries until I found one

626
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,520
type that I can take right before bed so

627
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,440
I don't have any of the woozy or or

628
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,799
seditive side effects. And I wake up in

629
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,320
the morning and the next day I'm a

630
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,679
little bit less likely to have a

631
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,600
headache. But if I do have a headache,

632
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,000
maybe the pain is a little bit lower.

633
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,520
But what you just articulated is so

634
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,760
critical for all of us to understand

635
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,520
that it might work for you if you find

636
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,600
the right one. You had a question, an

637
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,039
important question that links CBD and

638
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,960
marijuana maybe. Yeah. You know, Dr.

639
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,880
Isacson, some studies suggest that

640
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,960
marijuana could have a negative effect

641
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,880
on long and short-term memory. Should we

642
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,400
worry about this with CBD? This is a

643
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,039
great question and it's important that

644
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,720
when we ingest CBD oftentimes in the

645
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,120
products that you tested there may be

646
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,799
CBD but there may be other compounds. Um

647
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,200
for example there may be low levels of

648
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,039
THC or tetrahydroinabonol.

649
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,039
THC is the stuff that makes the

650
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,880
psychoactive effects and makes you feel

651
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,520
different in marijuana. In marijuana

652
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,880
exactly so depending on the product um I

653
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,799
think the devil is in the details like

654
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,159
Dr. Ros said some people may need a

655
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,919
little bit of this a little bit of that.

656
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,600
It's the combination, the dose, the

657
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,919
timing, and some people, it's probably

658
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,600
not going to work at all. Bottom line,

659
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,440
there's no good evidence right now for

660
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,200
CBD and brain health. But I do see

661
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,640
opportunities on the horizon, whether

662
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,240
it's for treating Alzheimer's, dementia,

663
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,840
improving memory. We're going to track

664
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
the latest research for you, and we'll

665
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,919
continue to bring you updates. Next week

666
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,760
in our CBD series, can CBD help melt

667
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,960
away stress and anxiety? That is

668
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,320
probably the single biggest question I'm

669
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,840
getting these days. We're revealing what

670
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,679
we've uncovered from a coast to coast

671
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,880
survey, and test results are going to be

672
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,480
there that, well, they might surprise

673
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,720
you. Tune in next Wednesday. If you have

674
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,700
a burning CBD question, go to my website

675
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,849
and submit it. We'll be right back.

676
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,849
[Applause]

677
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,240
Coming up on the Dish on us, I've got

678
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,120
these two chefs to confess to get this.

679
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,880
Use this microwave. Okay, wait a second.

680
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,799
Just because I'm a food expert does not

681
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,080
mean I'm always fancy. That's right.

682
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,080
We're going to reveal the secret way

683
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,919
chefs use microwaves to make our cooking

684
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,919
easier, but just as yummy.

685
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,480
If there's one thing that brings us all

686
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,720
together, it's food. So, we're calling

687
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,720
everyone to the table to dish on

688
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,120
everything from the latest food hacks

689
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,840
and trends to everyday recipes you can

690
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,840
make for dinner tonight. It's simple.

691
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,039
It's celebratory. And most of all, it's

692
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,440
about having a great time in the

693
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:55,480
kitchen. What is going on? I'm trying to

694
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,480
help. Let's dish.

695
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,200
Welcome back. The dish on Oscar is here

696
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,200
today and I asked Gail and Daphne a big

697
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,120
challenge. Here's the deal. Could they

698
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,240
tap their amazing culinary skills and

699
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,080
think inside the box? Like the microwave

700
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,679
box, right? So, what are you dishing up,

701
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,360
Daffhne?

702
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,279
Well, today you guys, we are making sure

703
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,600
that the microwave is not just for dorm

704
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,120
rooms or reheating leftovers anymore.

705
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,039
Gail and I have put our collective

706
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,480
culinary wisdom together, and today we

707
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,400
are sharing the chef's secrets to

708
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,640
microwave your way to quick and easy

709
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,120
meals. I'm going to hold on tight.

710
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,559
Cheers to that. Cheers to that. We are

711
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,520
making, get this, you guys, a lightened

712
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,559
up spaghetti carbonara with bacon. Not

713
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,480
skimping on the bacon. And to go with

714
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,880
that, we are going to make some yummy

715
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,360
roasted garlic bread. And by the way,

716
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,360
shaving literal hours off of your cook

717
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,840
time here. And then a chocolate brownie

718
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,919
mug cake. You are going to love.

719
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,919
Hallelujah. My favorite little magic

720
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,440
trick. I love this cake. It's a magic

721
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,200
trick in the kitchen. And it's really

722
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,640
fun for kids to watch. just if you want

723
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,000
to if you have a doctor in the house who

724
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,200
wants to then explain the science of how

725
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,799
it all works. It's really cool. But

726
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,240
anyway, my kids I think it's really fun,

727
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,360
too. Um, let's start with the main

728
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,520
course. I'm going to show you guys how

729
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,360
to make a spaghetti squash dinner with a

730
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,360
lightened up carbonara sauce. It's all

731
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,559
made in the microwave and um and it's

732
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,159
just something fun. I use a lot of

733
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,080
spaghetti squash in my cooking at home

734
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,520
because a you know, the sauce is what

735
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,360
counts and spaghetti squash is an

736
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,039
incredible standin if you're looking to

737
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,640
cut carbs or you want to swap out um

738
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,320
your pasta. So, spaghetti squash

739
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,159
obviously shows up at the grocery store

740
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,080
looking like this. You just slice it in

741
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,000
half. And then I'm going to scoop out

742
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,520
the seeds here. So, I'm just going to

743
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,960
add a little olive oil here. Gail, if

744
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,240
you'll grab this guy and just rub them

745
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,720
down with that olive oil and a little

746
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,039
salt. Thank you very much. And then I'm

747
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,200
just going to put it um cut side down

748
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,559
into a dish like so. We can do one at a

749
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,080
time or we can squeeze them into the hot

750
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,159
tub. Come on, guys. Share the hot tub.

751
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,640
Okay. And all you want to do is put

752
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,559
about an inch of water, tap water, up uh

753
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,080
on top of the uh squash so that you

754
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,320
actually are going to help steam it from

755
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,159
the microwave. Um, so I have about that

756
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,559
inch of water in there. It really is.

757
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,799
It's a squash spa. A squash spa. And by

758
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,600
the way, guys, 15 minutes in your

759
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:07,039
microwave and out it comes. Show me what

760
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,080
you're working with, Gail. Oh, yeah.

761
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,600
There you go. Check this out. And it

762
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,440
comes out. So, you can tell it's done.

763
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,039
Look, it's nice and it's nice and um,

764
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,960
you know, resist. It doesn't resist your

765
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,640
touch like that. Comes out looking like

766
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,840
so. And we each have one on our plates

767
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,919
that I'm going to show you how to come

768
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,919
how to uh, scrape and pull apart. But

769
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,000
obviously the carbonara sauce needs to

770
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,360
happen next. I've got four egg yolks

771
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,880
here. And this is, you know, you can see

772
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,880
it's sort of the traditional sauce here.

773
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,039
I've got a nice amount of pecorino or

774
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,120
parmesan, whichever you'd like. Then

775
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,760
I've got a little pinch of pepper. And

776
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,600
then because I promised you guys bacon

777
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,000
in this dish, I saved a little bacon fat

778
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,080
for you. Right there. You're good to us.

779
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,360
Just a little bit to give it some of

780
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,000
that fatty. I thought that was olive

781
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,760
oil. How mistaken I was. Smell it. No,

782
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,120
it's bacon. It's for sure bacon. Okay, I

783
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,520
gave you guys each some here. Now,

784
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,360
here's how fun this is to give everyone

785
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,880
their own portion. Okay, so grab some

786
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,480
Oh, we do it first. Yeah. Grab about

787
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,760
half of this sauce. And that's just what

788
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,440
I made right there. That egg yolk

789
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,440
mixture with the cheese. And then use

790
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,520
your fork and just pull up those strands

791
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,760
down from the skin. Okay. Give that a

792
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,120
little toss around right onto your

793
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,760
plate. And of course, grab some crispy

794
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,720
bacon. Give that a little topping here.

795
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,159
What are you doing? What are you? You

796
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,799
don't even need the bacon. You get the

797
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,039
bacon arguably. We always need the

798
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,320
bacon. You don't even need it. And give

799
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,559
that a quick taste. Let's see. Let's

800
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,399
season if we need to. Let's grab a

801
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,559
little bit. It actually the texture is

802
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,279
so reminiscent of real pasta, but of

803
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,880
course it's low carb, low glycemic. You

804
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,320
can do this on keto. You can have a

805
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,279
fantastic time. All right. So, it's time

806
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,559
to tally up how much we saved in time

807
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,640
with the microwave, right? Are you ready

808
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,799
for this recipe? The dish took 15

809
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,799
minutes to cook using the microwave. In

810
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,679
the oven, it would have taken 40

811
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,080
minutes. Time zap. 25 minutes.

812
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,440
Absolutely. Um, now here's the thing.

813
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,799
That's not the only time we're saving.

814
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,880
You're not going to believe this next

815
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,279
chef microwave secret. You can roast

816
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,840
garlic in the microwave. Gail, give us

817
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,840
the details on how to roast garlic. So,

818
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,440
everyone knows you can roast garlic in

819
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,600
the oven. You just roast it. You slice

820
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,960
it in half. Roast it in foil if you

821
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,679
want. I'm going to do the most amazing

822
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,000
microwave trick. So, you take a full

823
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,320
head of garlic and you just slice it in

824
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,480
half. Sort of 2/3 of the way up the

825
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,799
garlic head. So, it looks like this. Put

826
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,960
it in a bowl. I'm going to drizzle just

827
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,880
a little bit of olive oil on it. A

828
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,039
little bit of pepper

829
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,720
as well, some salt, and just a little

830
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,919
bit of water in the bottom. That little

831
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,600
bit of water is actually critical in

832
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,880
both of these recipes cuz that's part of

833
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,640
how the steam that's the cooking.

834
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,559
Exactly. I'm going to cover it. I'm

835
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,960
using another plate. I don't want to use

836
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,760
a plastic if I can help it. And then I'm

837
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,600
going to put it in the microwave right

838
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,840
here. And I'm going to take out the one

839
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,440
that I've cooked for eight or nine

840
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,520
minutes. Now, keep in mind, everybody's

841
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,120
microwave is a little bit different. So,

842
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,640
you have to watch it. I would look at it

843
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,320
halfway through. Make sure nothing's

844
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,960
exploding. Microwaves can be a bit

845
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,840
unruly. They get very hot. So,

846
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
everyone's going to be a little

847
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,440
different. This is about eight or nine

848
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,159
minutes in the microwave. And look how

849
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,760
brown and roasted and beautiful that is.

850
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,159
They keep you pinch them out. Yeah.

851
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,720
Well, here you go. Exactly.

852
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,320
Okay. So, to make perfect roasted garlic

853
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,559
bread, this is the greatest trick, too.

854
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,960
You have it and it you know that it has

855
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,159
pulled itself away from the skin. So all

856
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,760
you have to do is squeeze and all those

857
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,600
beautiful Does this actually work? It's

858
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,520
exactly the same as it was. It really

859
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,600
looked roasted, right? Make sure I don't

860
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,080
get that piece of ste, as you said, they

861
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,320
pulled away. Yep. Get all those pieces

862
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,039
out. And I'm just going to squeeze it

863
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,600
into a bowl with some parsley, some soft

864
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,440
like room temperature butter, and then

865
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,000
some chili flakes, a little salt and

866
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,480
pepper. Mash it all up, and you have

867
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,519
ready to go roasted garlic bread. So, as

868
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,720
you get ready to taste this, we're going

869
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,640
to talk about how much time we have

870
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,240
saved roasting garlic in the microwave

871
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,919
because it looks exactly the same as if

872
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,440
you had actually taken it to an oven.

873
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,559
Eight minutes, as you mentioned, Gail,

874
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,880
normally you have to to take it roughly

875
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,279
about an hour cooking an oven. That's 52

876
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,480
minutes. We have zapped off this recipe

877
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,600
with our microwave. How's it taste?

878
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,600
Great. Would you like to have a little

879
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,159
bite? And you can just serve this like

880
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,480
this kind of rustic and beautiful on the

881
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,120
table as a perfect side dish to your

882
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,120
carbonara spaghetti squash or you know

883
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,440
as an appetizer before the meal and

884
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,120
garlic fresh. Why waste 52 minutes when

885
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,799
it tastes exactly the same in the

886
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,399
microwave. I'll toast never going back.

887
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,320
You know what? I'll take this app.

888
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,600
Cheers. I'll raise you a main course

889
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,919
which you made also. But when we come

890
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,120
back we have a microwavable dessert you

891
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,200
can reach for whatever you want.

892
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,600
Something indulgent in just seconds.

893
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,600
Stay with us.

894
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,840
Jeffrey Epstein. Was it suicide or

895
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,559
murder? The medical examiner that was

896
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,720
inside his autopsy. Plus, the photos

897
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,740
that question how he died. All new Oz.

898
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,130
That's coming up tomorrow.

899
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,130
[Music]

900
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,640
We're back with a dish on Oz. And

901
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,399
microwaves have taken over that kitchen.

902
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,480
But here's the question. Can you really

903
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,159
microwave dessert and make it taste

904
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,919
great? Dish the details on this

905
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,000
concoction you come up with. Let me tell

906
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,480
you, the first time I saw this trick, I

907
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,240
thought it was magic. The fact that you

908
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,919
can make an ooey gooey delicious brownie

909
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,840
lava mug cake that is rich. It's poetry.

910
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,120
Delicious.

911
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,200
It takes 90 seconds. 90 seconds. On the

912
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,279
clock. So, here's what you do. The

913
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,559
simplest thing you'll ever make and your

914
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,640
friends and family will think you're a

915
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:39,039
genius. You can thank me later. Flour in

916
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,679
a bowl. I'm gonna mix in some sugar,

917
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,000
cocoa powder, a little bit of baking

918
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,000
powder, and just a pinch of salt. Okay.

919
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,320
All your dry ingredients into a bowl.

920
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,919
Give it a bit of a whisk. So, basically

921
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,240
homemade cake mix. Just really easy.

922
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,640
Exactly. Cake mix. Very simple. I mean,

923
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,159
no actual tricks here. It's just the

924
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,799
magic of the microwave. I'm going to

925
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,480
pour in some milk.

926
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,200
cup of milk. And you want to just pour

927
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,360
in that vanilla. Oh yeah, you gotoop.

928
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,039
There you go.

929
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,839
Look how clean we are. This is ready to

930
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,679
go. I love that part of this. Makes it

931
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,560
easy. This is the whole thing. Then I

932
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,560
literally just divide this cake mix into

933
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,599
four mugs. Microwavable mugs, microwave

934
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,320
safe mugs. Divide them in. And then the

935
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,079
most beautiful part, take a little

936
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,800
square of chocolate. I prefer dark

937
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,919
chocolate, of course. Stick it in the

938
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,280
center.

939
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,960
of each of the mugs in the cake mix.

940
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,440
This is the molten situation. Going to

941
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,800
be very satisfying later. Okay, so these

942
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,000
are going to go in the microwave. If you

943
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,320
want to grab me the finished one, 90

944
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,480
seconds. You want to cook for 30 second

945
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,679
intervals three times until it's done.

946
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,760
You'll know they're done when they have

947
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,449
a slight jiggle, but they look like

948
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,159
baked cake.

949
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:54,560
[Applause]

950
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,000
Oh, wow. Dad, look at that. They're

951
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,680
They're jiggling in the middle, but not

952
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,160
on the sides. This is it. They're done.

953
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,200
They're warm. Wow. I'm going to top them

954
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:07,359
with a little bit of vanilla ice cream,

955
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,760
right? Why stop with chocolate? Exactly.

956
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,839
It looks like um hot cocoa kind of but

957
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,280
better version.

958
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,800
Thank you very much. Have a bite, guys.

959
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,320
Cheers, guys. Cheers. Mhm. Cheers, Dad.

960
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,160
Okay, give us a little taste here. Oh,

961
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,040
it is. It's ooey gooey as described.

962
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,280
Full molten. Are you kidding? chocolatey

963
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,839
gooey cake and it's fully cooked. Oh my

964
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,079
goodness.

965
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,680
And I I actually one of my all-time

966
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,040
favorite desserts is brownies alam mode

967
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,640
because you get that warm brownie that

968
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,400
starts to melt the ice cream on top of

969
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,320
it and it just it the whole thing is

970
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,160
it's a race. You have to eat it fast.

971
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,760
This is what's happening. My favorite.

972
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,560
Okay, you guys. Speaking of microwaving

973
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,200
chocolate, everyone is freaking out over

974
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,200
Kim Kardashian's Snapchat video of she

975
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,400
and her sister Courtney. Of her and her

976
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,160
sister Courtney eating microwaved M&M's.

977
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,640
We didn't believe. We had to try for

978
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,720
ourselves. I put it in for 20 seconds.

979
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,440
We got ourselves a hefty portion of

980
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,680
M&M's, you guys. Wow. Okay, let's see if

981
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,760
this really works. Give it a try. I'm

982
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,440
going I mean, I will eat an I will eat

983
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,240
an M&M kind of anyway you give it to me.

984
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,040
But she did a good sell on it. I mean,

985
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,960
it is just that nice little warm soft

986
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,480
center. It takes advantage of that candy

987
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,560
coating so it doesn't melt everywhere.

988
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,280
Stays warm on the inside. Personally,

989
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,040
I'll go with a lava cake here. Uh-huh.

990
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,839
But when we come back, we have the food

991
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,000
that rivals my love of Greek yogurt.

992
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,480
He's still in my heart. Do I have a new

993
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,480
love? Stay tuned. It's all happening,

994
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,480
guys.

995
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,520
We're back with a dish. And I was

996
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,920
asking, could anything replace my

997
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,599
beloved my beloved Greek yogurt? Right.

998
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,560
Well, there's a delicious creamy

999
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,560
contender that has, get this, just as

1000
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,800
much protein as Greek yogurt and even

1001
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,520
more protein than two eggs. Daffy, it

1002
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,200
is. Mhm. It is our food find of the day,

1003
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,839
you guys. Daisy cottage cheese. Cottage

1004
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,320
cheese is making a comeback as America's

1005
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,320
go-to snack or meal because it's packed

1006
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,320
with protein, like you just said, and

1007
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,800
also because it's delicious. Can I stop

1008
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,560
for a second? I got through college on

1009
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,160
cottage cheese and I grew up as a little

1010
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,320
boy. My mom would put cottage cheese and

1011
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,839
and peaches together. I don't know what

1012
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,839
happened to it. It disappeared for a

1013
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,040
Didn't this seem to go away? So, today

1014
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,720
we're going to make cottage cheese

1015
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,560
breakfast bowls, giving you a kind of a

1016
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,920
new spin on how to use that cottage

1017
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,280
cheese. Dad, you're going to start

1018
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,560
making one over there. Then, I'm going

1019
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,480
to show you a couple others that would

1020
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,079
work. And what I really love about Daisy

1021
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,000
cottage cheese is made with simple

1022
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,200
ingredients like cultured skim milk,

1023
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,400
cream, and salt, plus no added sugar. I

1024
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,320
love this. I love when you turn the

1025
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,520
label around and you can see exactly you

1026
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,359
recognize the ingredients and there's

1027
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,040
only three of them here. It comes in two

1028
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,320
varieties, 2% lowfat or 4% regular. So,

1029
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,160
it can be a great way to get some

1030
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,079
healthy fats into your day, too. And

1031
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,680
what I really love about Daisy Cottage

1032
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,520
cheese is how versatile it is. So, you

1033
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,320
can add it to any recipe that needs some

1034
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,720
creamy protein boost like some pancakes

1035
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,400
or even pasta sauces in some cases. But

1036
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,320
today, I want to show you two different

1037
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,000
bowls that I'm making with 4% Daisy

1038
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,000
cottage cheese because they're just so

1039
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,280
pretty and they're also so delicious.

1040
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,560
So, here I'm going to show you a savory

1041
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,000
breakfast bowl. This one's kind of cool

1042
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,280
because people think cottage cheese,

1043
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,599
sometimes they think sweet. This one

1044
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,079
actually uses roasted broccoli. I added

1045
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,520
a layer of um smoked or or toasted

1046
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,200
almonds there as well. I love that bit

1047
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,760
of crunch. Then, I'm going to take a

1048
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,680
wedge of lemon just to kick it up a

1049
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,520
notch with that little bit of that tangy

1050
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,200
kick. And I also added a little bit of

1051
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,200
chili pepper flake because I do like

1052
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,599
that bit of zing to it. This is a really

1053
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,599
fun lunch or dinner or snack or a savory

1054
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,760
breakfast if you like that. My dad is

1055
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,280
making a sweet one. This one I think is

1056
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,079
such a clever idea. Dad, tell us about

1057
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,920
this dish. This is cottage cheese base.

1058
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,839
Yeah. Some pears, some figs, toasted

1059
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,079
walnuts. Omega threes in there. Guys,

1060
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,359
look at how Instagrammable this is. Come

1061
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,200
on. Give it a little drizzle. Little

1062
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,359
drizzle. Like this. This could be you.

1063
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,000
This could be you. Okay. Give it a

1064
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,000
taste, too. Let's see. I I already know,

1065
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,920
you know, I got to say I think this year

1066
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,240
this year cottage cheese makes its big

1067
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,240
