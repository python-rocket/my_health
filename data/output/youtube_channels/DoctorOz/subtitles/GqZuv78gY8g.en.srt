00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,759
A warning. The photos you're about to

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:10,240
see are graphic. These are scars, scabs,

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,559
and open wounds that are often hidden by

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,599
closed ribbon makeup. And they're caused

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:19,119
by people who compulsively pick away at

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,760
their own skin. Today, the secret life

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,080
of skin pickers. We're going behind

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,080
closed doors to uncover how this secret

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:33,970
obsession can control lives.

[Music]

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,040
I just woke up about to get ready to go

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,200
to work. Um, the first thing I thought

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,160
about when I woke up this morning was

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
how the scabs that I picked out

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,079
yesterday have probably healed over so I

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
can pick up them again. I never account

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,440
for the amount of time in the morning

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,440
it's going to take me to pick and

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,300
sometimes I end up being late to places,

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:04,909
too. Um, but it's uncontrollable.

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,909
[Music]

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,680
The urge to pick has been in the back of

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,680
my mind all day. Um, I was thinking at

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
work, like, am I going to be able to

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,400
pick this one? Um, am I going to be able

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
to pick the ones on my legs? It's just

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
something that's constantly there. My

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,000
fingers are constantly scanning. I'm

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,600
just constantly doing it. And sometimes

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,600
I even pick until I bleed. And

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,640
I just don't know how to stop or how to

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,640
resist that urge.

34
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,360
[Music]

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,119
I just got home from work. I was picking

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,560
a lot at work and I just got out of the

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,960
shower and that stung because the some

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,560
of the wounds were still open. Um

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,880
I still have the urge to pick. I'm

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,479
literally skinning my body as I'm like

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,960
doing this right now.

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,520
>> Katherine is here. Thank you for coming.

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,799
>> Thank you.

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,040
>> This is sensitive.

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,800
>> A lot of us pop pimples. We pick at

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,920
skin.

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,160
But in your case, at around age five, it

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
became much more significant than most

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,120
kids experience. What happened?

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,879
>> Uh so when I was five, I had really,

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
really sensitive skin. So it would be

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,440
down to sitting in the grass. I would

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
start to itch. Chlorine from pools,

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,239
scented lotions, perfumes. And so I

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,120
developed eczema around age eight. And

56
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,200
then eventually that went from just

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,200
scratching at my skin to starting to

58
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,720
pick and to pick and to pick. And

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,480
it was just something where it was just

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,519
I was constantly doing it, but I didn't

61
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
really think that there was anything

62
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,319
that was wrong with it. It was just

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,599
something that I was doing.

64
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,200
>> And notice how you're dressed now.

65
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,120
You've you've covered up your skin.

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,120
>> Yeah. How does it affect you when your

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,040
skin's not covered and people see the

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
scabs in your legs or your arms and and

69
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,000
comment?

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,680
>> It's It's definitely a little bit

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,879
embarrassing. Um, at first when I first

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
started picking, I didn't think that

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,560
anything was wrong. And then once I

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,640
started going out and I had like the

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
scabs and the scars all over my leg,

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,440
that was when people would be like,

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,560
"What's wrong with you?" Like, "What

78
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,159
happened to you? What happened to your

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,760
legs?" Or they'd be like, "Who beat you

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,920
up?" or something like that. And then

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,200
that was when I started to think, "Maybe

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,560
there is something wrong with me like

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,239
maybe this isn't something that other

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
people are doing as well. Do

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,879
>> you plan your day around whether people

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,440
see your scabs or not?

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,200
>> Yeah. So, I would wear like long pants

88
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,200
even in like the dead of summer when

89
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,920
it's like a million degrees outside. And

90
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,599
then I switched. I figured, okay, I want

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,440
to wear shorts, so let me put on makeup

92
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,560
now. So, I'd start to put makeup all

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,040
over my legs, all over my arms. And I

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,640
remember very specifically I was like on

95
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,799
the bus and the makeup was not the same

96
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,000
color as my legs at all. So people they

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,519
knew like they could tell that I was

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,120
wearing makeup and it was raining that

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,040
day and I remember the kids on the bus

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,400
were like oh well if you are like they'd

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,599
be trying to like rub at the makeup on

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
my legs and stuff like that and they'd

103
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,799
be like well if you are wearing makeup

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
when you go out into the rain we're

105
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
going to see it. It's going to run. And

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,040
I remember it was like a two-minute walk

107
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,280
from the bus to my house, but it felt

108
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,920
like I was walking for miles just to get

109
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,440
back to my house, trying to walk fast,

110
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,160
but not too fast so they wouldn't say

111
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,800
anything. And so then I tried to switch

112
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,199
to covering up with a bandage. And so I

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,919
would wrap like my entire shin with like

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,600
an ace bandage and I told people that I

115
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,840
sprained my shin. It was just

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
strategically planning the things that I

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,680
wore, trying to find different ways to

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
hide all of the scars. Is there ever a

119
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,360
moment of the day where you're not

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,400
thinking about picking at your skin?

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,800
>> No.

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,720
>> I'm just thinking about you and how

123
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,080
you're navigating life with these these

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,120
scabs.

125
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,680
>> What's your biggest fear?

126
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,080
>> My biggest fear would be that I wouldn't

127
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,919
that I can't stop it. Cuz when I was

128
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,840
young, I'd be like, "Okay, well, when

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,479
I'm in my 20s, that's it's going to go

130
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,120
away." And then I'm like, well, I'm 24

131
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,199
now and it's still it's still going on.

132
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,720
And so I worry that it's something that

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,840
I'm always going to have and it's not

134
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
going to go away.

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,320
>> So I did a little homework after I heard

136
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,919
of your story and there are many many

137
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,840
women like you and it's the shame as you

138
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,320
mentioned that hold so many back from

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,560
moving forward. So I'm going to

140
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,039
challenge you. How hard would it be for

141
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,520
you to show your scabs right now to all

142
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,919
of America?

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,400
It all started when I was a teen and I

144
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,400
endured some bullying and some abuse. It

145
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,360
started as a bad habit and a little bit

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,520
of an addiction. And then in my 20s, I

147
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,639
experienced some trauma where I ended up

148
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,360
in the bathroom for about 6 hours a day

149
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,720
kind of disassociating and in a zone. At

150
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,120
that point, I entered a partial

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,759
hospitalization program that really

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,600
helped me find what my triggers were.

153
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,759
Start surrounding myself with people

154
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,479
that loved and supported me instead of

155
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,160
toxic relationships. And then finally,

156
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,600
forgiving myself. There will be

157
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,840
relapses, but there is hope and you can

158
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,520
get there.

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,919
We're back uncovering a secret skin

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,000
obsession that women are hiding behind

161
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,000
closed doors. They need to constantly

162
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,160
pick at their own skin. Whether it's

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,639
pimples or bumps on their face or scabs

164
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,880
on their legs, they're consumed by this

165
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,560
urge to pick. Catherine is back. Ever

166
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,800
since she started picking her skin at

167
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,479
the age of five, she has not been able

168
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,479
to stop. And I know that you don't like

169
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,919
to show your skin. What do you think?

170
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,280
>> It's a little nerve-wracking.

171
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,280
>> Oh, I can imagine.

172
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,440
>> But I don't know of a better example of

173
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,880
how we face our fears than to show

174
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,360
people what you really look like.

175
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,120
>> Yeah.

176
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,880
>> And the skin is the most visible thing.

177
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,520
So, if you can do this, you can do

178
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,080
anything.

179
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,560
>> Okay.

180
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,960
>> All right.

181
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,360
>> All right.

182
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,360
>> I'll let you lead you pace it.

183
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,360
>> Okay.

184
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,520
So, what parts of your skin

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,599
were you the most are the parts that you

186
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,400
would regret us seeing?

187
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,440
>> Um,

188
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,360
>> I see you have some

189
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,120
>> definitely. Yeah.

190
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,120
on my left arm.

191
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,479
>> When you think look at these, what do

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,160
you feel?

193
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,680
>> Um,

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240
it's a little bit embarrassing to look

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,639
at them, to see my skin like this and

196
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,319
know that I did that to myself.

197
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,639
>> Now, how about the judgment that I

198
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,280
suspect you feel when people see this

199
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,960
and wonder what's what's she doing?

200
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,680
>> Yeah, I've I've had some crazy

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,840
questions. Um people have asked me if

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,520
it's a cigarette burn, if it's um like

203
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,039
addictions to drugs, like different

204
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,960
things like that. And um so I think just

205
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,560
like the perception that people have of

206
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,199
what it is is

207
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,280
Yeah.

208
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,479
>> Do you feel it's an addiction?

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,160
Yeah, it could be an an addiction

210
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,680
because,

211
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,440
you know, it's something that I do every

212
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,759
single day and I know that it's harming

213
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,960
me and I know that it's harming my skin

214
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,199
and I just continue to do it. And since

215
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,560
it's also providing me that relief at

216
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,560
the same time, it's like

217
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,400
I don't know. I just it's just something

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
I keep doing.

219
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,440
>> Come over here. I want to show you what

220
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,199
I'm most worried about. Obviously the

221
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,199
emotional aspects of this are important

222
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,000
but I made a little simple illustration

223
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,440
right very rudimentary of the body right

224
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
skin is your largest organ you know that

225
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,560
already and if you look at the skin take

226
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,599
one step back so you can see you'll be

227
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,320
able to see it better if you turn back

228
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,000
here

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,000
>> so I just outlined the fact that you've

230
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
got a lot of surface area it's a it's a

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,200
great line of defense right protects you

232
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,599
against germs it makes sure everything

233
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440
stays inside like it's supposed to right

234
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,800
however when you start to itch at it a

235
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,240
bunch of things happen first of all you

236
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,480
chip away at your body's own defense

237
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,080
system so each of these scabs

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,279
You're worried about the scars and what

239
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,279
people say about you. I'm worried about

240
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,880
these open wounds where you no longer

241
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,880
have a natural body's defense against

242
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,959
viruses and germs getting into you. And

243
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,880
those infections can be problematic. But

244
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,880
even a bigger problem is the infection

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,959
go deep into there and actually get into

246
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,959
your blood vessels and that can lead to

247
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,880
a bad problem called sepsis. It's a much

248
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,640
deeper infection or you could actually

249
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,640
literally burrow infections into veins

250
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,920
and arteries which can be catastrophic,

251
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,600
life-threatening even. And when I see

252
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,080
someone who's got everything actually on

253
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,640
the surface going for them threatening

254
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,600
their own well-being in addition to to

255
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,240
torturing themselves emotionally, it

256
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,080
hurts me. Obviously hurts you.

257
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,000
>> So I brought a world expert in to help

258
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,320
us if you're willing to get the help.

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
>> Yeah,

260
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,080
>> you are. Okay, come on over here. Let me

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
introduce you to psychologist, a

262
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,720
psychologist who specializes in picking

263
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,160
and they're not that many, but they're

264
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
out there. Dr. Kristen Banke, thank you

265
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,480
for joining us, Kristen.

266
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,680
>> Thank you for having me. So she she's

267
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,959
from the center of anxiety and

268
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,720
behavioral health and

269
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,320
just help me understand in the audience

270
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,240
as well what's going on. What what is

271
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,640
this compulsive repetitive behavior?

272
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,519
>> Sure. So it's called excoriation

273
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,519
disorder and the behaviors associated

274
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,080
with it. Picking scabs, squeezing pores,

275
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,040
popping pimples are what are known as

276
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,279
body focused repetitive behaviors. What

277
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,800
we know is that the most common triggers

278
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,120
that we see are stress,

279
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
boredom, anxiety.

280
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,440
>> So what's the first step? How do you get

281
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,959
started?

282
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,680
>> So the first thing that we would

283
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,320
recommend is to keep a behavior tracking

284
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,760
diary. And then lastly, we want them to

285
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,160
pay very careful attention to the

286
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,640
purpose that the behaviors serve. How do

287
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,560
they feel immediately afterwards? Do

288
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,560
they feel relieved? Does it provide a

289
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,320
sense of satisfaction or gratification?

290
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,519
Does their anxiety reduce?

291
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,519
>> All right. So, the big question is

292
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,760
actually for you.

293
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,399
>> You spent most of your life struggling

294
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
with this, embarrassed by, you use the

295
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,800
word ashamed.

296
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,600
>> Are you willing to make a change today?

297
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,000
>> Yeah.

298
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,120
>> Good.

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,399
>> Yeah.

300
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,680
>> You'll make it happen.

301
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,279
>> I want to make it happen.

302
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,440
>> Dr. Bianke wants to help you.

303
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,519
and you have a center that focuses on

304
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,880
this. What What do you want Katherine to

305
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,279
know about the next steps?

306
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,160
>> Um, so we use cognitive behavior therapy

307
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,680
and that is the scientifically supported

308
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,680
therapy for this disorder. What we're

309
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,279
going to be doing is hard work. I I want

310
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,320
to be honest about that. I want to be

311
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,040
upfront, but we're going to work

312
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,959
together as a team. And I can commit to

313
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,360
you that I will work as hard as I

314
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,640
possibly can for you. And in return, I

315
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
need that commitment that you will work

316
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,279
as hard as you can for me. Okay,

317
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
>> I can do it.

318
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,399
>> Yeah. Yeah.

319
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,399
>> Okay.

320
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,399
>> Yeah.

321
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,120
>> In that spirit, I'd love for us to work

322
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,160
together as a team so that we can help

323
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,399
you beat this.

324
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,320
>> Okay.

325
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,079
>> And I hope that you accept my offer.

326
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
>> Yeah.

327
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,000
>> So, she's going to take you under her

328
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,560
wing.

329
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,560
>> Okay.

330
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,760
>> She has all these cool little ideas.

331
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,839
Many of them I've never thought of.

332
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,440
never even heard of that I I think will

333
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,040
be successful for you and want to keep

334
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,279
following you to make sure you do well.

335
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,480
Okay.

336
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
>> But it starts with you and it'll end

337
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
with you.

338
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,959
>> All right.

339
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,519
>> God bless you.

340
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,120
