1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,839
He was subjected to one of the most

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,240
famous murder trials of our time and

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,240
known as part of the West Memphis 3

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,960
after being sentenced to die from lethal

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,759
injection. Damen Eckles was set free

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,400
after serving 18 years on death row for

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,560
murder. And today he is here speaking

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,880
out on life after being sentenced to

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,119
die. His story is being compared to a

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,359
real life witch hunt. And although Damen

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,679
is out from behind bars, will his past

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,000
hold him prisoner forever? Our affiliate

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,440
in Little Rock, Arkansas, KEV, covered

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,760
the story extensively.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,480
May 5th, 1993,

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,719
three 8-year-old boys, Stevie Branch,

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,879
Christopher Buyers, and Michael Moore,

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,680
went for a bike ride in their hometown

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,719
of West Memphis, Arkansas. They never

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,280
returned home for dinner. The next day,

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,399
their bodies were found naked, tied with

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,800
shoelaces, and mutilated in a dish. With

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,079
very little evidence, police focused on

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,360
three local teens, Damen Eckles, Jesse

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,600
Miss Kelly Jr., and Jason Baldwin. The

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,920
teen stood out in the Bible belt,

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,400
especially Damian Eckles, with his

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,680
interests in heavy metal music, gothic

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,680
dress, and fascination with occultism.

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,439
The young men, nicknamed the West

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,400
Memphis 3, were arrested in 1994.

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,720
Jesse Miss Kelly had a very low IQ and

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,520
was interrogated for a high pressure 12

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,000
hours leading to a confession. I saw

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,400
Damian hit this one hit this homeboy

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,240
real bad. Then the Jason turn around and

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,720
hit

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,040
Steve Branch Michael Mo took off

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,400
running. So I chased him and grabbed him

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,640
and held him.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,520
Jesse and Jason were sentenced to life

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,840
in prison. Damen was sentenced to death.

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,560
While on death row, Eckles met his

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,399
biggest advocate, Lorie Davis, who

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,520
started writing him letters determined

46
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,640
to set him free. After 3 years, they

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,520
wed. Lorie started a movement and

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,599
created a media firestorm. Celebrities

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,400
and musicians rallied around the West

50
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,959
Memphis 3. Johnny Depp, Pearl Jam's

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,800
Eddie Veter, and director Peter Jackson

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,840
used their voices to speak out about

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,920
what many felt to be the injust and lack

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,280
evidence tying these men to the murders.

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,760
August 19th, 2011, the West Memphis

56
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,840
three were released from prison, but

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,800
their story of freedom is far from over.

58
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,040
Damian Eckles joins me now. You know,

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
you watch that old footage of the

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,519
interviews you did, the trials. What's

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,760
it like sitting here,

62
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,959
a free man after having been in that

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,920
situation? Has that been imaginable?

64
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,440
It's It's hard to articulate it to

65
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
someone who's never experienced

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,480
something like that just because the

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,720
average person doesn't have anything in

68
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,800
their frame of reference to allow them,

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,560
I think, to comprehend like that level

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:10,080
of trauma. Um, some days it seems like

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,040
That entire 20 years was just a really

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,120
short bad dream. Other days it seems

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,080
like being out here is the dream that

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,519
surely I cannot be out of that prison

75
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
cell. You know, I was sitting there

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,640
waiting to die for so long uh that it

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
seems like

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,040
there's no way that I could have

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,959
possibly survived that. Um it it's one

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,000
it's

81
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,920
really really hard to describe. What was

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,280
your life like before this all started?

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,440
Before the arrest, before the

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,920
accusations, before the time on death

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
row,

86
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,840
you know, growing up in Arkansas, my

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,519
family was, and not just my family, our

88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,920
entire world, the world that we lived in

89
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,280
was dirt poor. You know, I dropped out

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,879
of school when I was in ninth grade. And

91
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,200
that's more education than anyone in my

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,640
family has. You know, everyone in the

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,400
world that we came from is pretty much

94
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,840
just working to survive another day in

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
the trailer park.

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,200
So, in the midst of all this, you get

97
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,040
accused

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,640
you know you're innocent, you go to

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,400
trial and then there's that moment when

100
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,400
the judge sentences you to death

101
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,160
hit you to hear those words. People

102
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,720
whenever they see the the documentaries

103
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,120
or or trial footage, they always say,

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
"You seem so calm." And what I try to

105
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,720
describe to people is what you're seeing

106
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,800
is not calm. What you're seeing is shock

107
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,639
and trauma.

108
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,400
Even now, you know, I'll I'll see people

109
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,919
sometimes who will say, you know, I

110
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,040
wouldn't have acted that way if it would

111
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,560
have been me. You know, if it would have

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,800
been me, I would have been screaming in

113
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,560
the courtroom. You know, I didn't do it.

114
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,639
And I think one of the greatest quotes

115
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
for that is something I heard Mike Tyson

116
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,840
say one time. He said, "Everybody's got

117
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
a plan until they get punched in the

118
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,800
face."

119
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Yeah.

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,280
That's what it's like. It's like you

121
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,360
don't know what you would do in a

122
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,440
situation where you're experiencing that

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,600
much trauma until you've actually been

124
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,280
in it. So after your sentence, they put

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,560
you in solitary confinement. It's a

126
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,800
space, if I understand correctly, it's

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,120
12 feet by 9 ft. That's how big the cell

128
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,919
is,

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,040
right?

130
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,000
What what does that do to you

131
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,479
physically?

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
It destroys you in every way a human

133
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,360
being can be destroyed psychologically,

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,039
emotionally, health-wise. Uh you know,

135
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,039
just things like there's almost no

136
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,240
medical care, no dental care. They're

137
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,600
not going to spend a lot of time and

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
money and energy taking care of someone

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,919
they plan on killing. So you're not

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,160
getting any fresh air, any sunlight,

141
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,080
you're eating garbage. It starts it

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
started destroying my eyesight. Uh at

143
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,600
one point

144
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,680
that why you're wearing the glasses.

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
Exactly. I I can see maybe two or three

146
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,240
inches in front of my face without these

147
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,479
glasses. Uh you know, I was in

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,720
horrendous pain a lot of times just

149
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,000
because uh like I said, they're not

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
trying to take care of you. They're

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
trying to kill you.

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,840
And I understand there are nights that

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,000
you went to sleep and you didn't think

154
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,360
you'd ever wake up. Why was it that

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,280
degree of risk?

156
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
Just, you know, when I first got to the

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,199
prison, and this wasn't even anything

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,039
personal. This was just the guards doing

159
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
what the guards do. Uh they took me to a

160
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,680
part of the prison they called the hole.

161
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,440
And for the next 18 days, they beat the

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,840
living hell out of me. They they beat me

163
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,840
so bad that I started to urinate blood

164
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,319
at one point. And there were times when

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
I laid down at night and I thought, I'm

166
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
not going to be able to get back up.

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
This is it. And it's it's not like

168
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,880
you're giving up. It's just like you

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,400
can't do it anymore.

170
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,560
You're exhausted. Finished

171
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,400
in every way that you can be exhausted.

172
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
There was no DNA evidence, just to be

173
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,919
clear with everybody. No DNA evidence.

174
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,759
There's no witnesses to connect Damian

175
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,400
to the crime. Many have called this a

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,160
real life witch hunt.

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,680
Why, if you were targeted, why do you

178
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
think they targeted you? Why pick on

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,120
you, Damen Eckles? You're apparently

180
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,759
minding your own business.

181
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,840
I think a lot of it was due to this was

182
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
during a time when um you know, people

183
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
are starting to forget it now, but

184
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,319
during the late 80s, early 90s, you had

185
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,720
a phenomenon in the United States called

186
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,960
satanic panic. But then when you start

187
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,880
talking about things like, you know, my

188
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,759
practices like ceremonial magic, when

189
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,160
you start talking about things like

190
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,160
that, then you're out and out blatantly

191
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,319
obviously a Satanist. So that kind of

192
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,120
put a bull's eye on my back in and of

193
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,479
itself.

194
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,440
Ceremonial magic.

195
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,759
Mhm.

196
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,400
Is that meditation? Is it incense?

197
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,400
It it's uh really what it comes down to.

198
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,960
It's like the yoga of the west. It is

199
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,000
the western path to the state of

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
consciousness that we call

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,400
enlightenment. So, as you as you look

202
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
back on the 20 years that you said seem

203
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,479
like a dream, maybe,

204
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,080
are you angry?

205
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,599
Honestly, no. Um, I I was for a while.

206
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,199
For probably the first two to three

207
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,639
years that I was on death row, I would

208
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,360
wake up in the morning angry. You know,

209
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,240
from the second your eyes open, you're

210
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,639
angry. I realized if I didn't do

211
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,400
something to overcome that, let go of

212
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,520
that, however you want to phrase it,

213
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,280
then I was doubling my suffering. You

214
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,720
know, I I I decided, like I said, I had

215
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,720
a ninth grade education. So, I decided

216
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,560
at one point that I wanted to educate

217
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,479
myself to just have the same frame of

218
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
reference that everybody else has. So, I

219
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,160
started not only doing, you know,

220
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,840
ceremonial magic, but I also tried to

221
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,000
read everything I could get my hands on.

222
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,599
you know, everything from Dorstoki and

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,919
and Toltoy and Kimu and Dickens to um

224
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,280
you know, the works of Freud or uh

225
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,120
Vietnam uh military history, anything I

226
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,960
could get my hands on just because I

227
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,120
wanted to keep developing as a person.

228
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,199
This is fascinating. You're not at all

229
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,199
at all what I expected. Coming up, meet

230
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,280
the woman who fought to save Damian's

231
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,000
life and married him when he was still

232
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,639
behind bars. That's next.

233
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,560
After more than 18 years of fighting for

234
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,560
freedom from prison, the men known

235
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,000
around the world as the West Memphis 3

236
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,800
are free tonight.

237
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,240
Very much in shock, still overwhelmed.

238
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,080
You know, you kind of have to take into

239
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,399
consideration that I've spent almost the

240
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
past decade in absolute solitary

241
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,839
confinement.

242
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,920
That was former West Memphis 3 inmate

243
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,959
Damen Eckles being released from prison

244
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,720
after spending 18 years on death row for

245
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,120
three counts of murder he says he did

246
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,600
not commit. that Damian is back and

247
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,920
we're also joined with his wife Lori who

248
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,120
fought for years for Damian's release.

249
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,120
So Lori, this whole story is so outside

250
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
the norm. I just started. How did you

251
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,600
even hear about Damian's story?

252
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,560
I was living here in New York and

253
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,920
there's a film series uh at MoMA called

254
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,240
New Directors New Films. And I'm a film

255
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,880
fanatic. And so I ended up going to see

256
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,519
the documentary Paradise Lost, which was

257
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,320
screened in 1996.

258
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,640
And being from the south originally and

259
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,839
growing up in a fundamentalist Baptist

260
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,839
home, I understood what was at least

261
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,040
what the community was doing. And I just

262
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,959
really felt for Damian and decided to

263
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,000
reach out to him just to see if I could

264
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,200
help in some way.

265
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,959
So Lori, just from hearing the story,

266
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,959
you had to make a decision that you

267
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,240
believe this man was innocent. What made

268
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,240
you so confident and steal your desire

269
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,680
to get him out of prison?

270
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,680
After seeing the film, my instincts told

271
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,480
me that something horrible had gone

272
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,440
wrong during the trial, but just knowing

273
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,279
him and getting to know him as a person,

274
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,200
I didn't doubt him.

275
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,800
So, Lori rallied behind Damian and

276
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,720
brought some famous supporters in like

277
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,399
Peter Jackson, Eddie Veter from Pearl

278
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,440
Jam. Larry, these are bigname guys.

279
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,040
Yeah.

280
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
How did Damian's story resonate with

281
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,839
them? Why did they get involved?

282
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,279
Same thing as far as seeing the film.

283
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,399
They saw Paradise Lost. And most of

284
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,680
these guys saw themselves as when they

285
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,440
were teenagers as rebels and they saw

286
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,880
themselves and Damian and thought it

287
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,320
could have been them.

288
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,959
And with Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh,

289
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,920
they just hated bullies. And when they

290
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,279
saw the film, they they contacted me and

291
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,040
just asked what they could do. They

292
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,680
ended up actually even coming on the

293
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,920
legal team, helping with investigation,

294
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,120
funding, forensic scientists, but

295
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,680
everybody once they got involved stayed

296
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,279
with us for the for the whole duration.

297
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,560
Damian, how important was that do you

298
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,839
think having this celebrity involvement?

299
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,120
And I'm just curious what what how did

300
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,440
you react when this woman's calling you

301
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,480
from New York saying, you know, let's

302
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,839
let's talk about this. I knew from the

303
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,519
second she found me that I was okay. You

304
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,880
know, I knew that other bad things may

305
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,640
happen while I was in there. I may be

306
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,240
beat. I may be starved, whatever. But I

307
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,800
knew from that point on that these

308
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,480
people could not kill me. And I don't

309
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,200
know how to describe that any more than

310
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,800
just that I felt safe. I felt like we

311
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
had clicked into place and what was

312
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,399
supposed to be happening was supposed to

313
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,399
be happening. The celebrity stuff, I I

314
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,160
really I think it was I would be dead

315
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,120
right now without it. I would be six

316
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,320
feet underground. and they would have

317
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,079
executed me years ago.

318
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,240
So, while you're Damian's in prison,

319
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,560
Laura, you get married in a Buddhist

320
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,120
ceremony. He's still on death row.

321
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,640
Yeah.

322
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,800
I mean, how'd your family and your

323
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
friends react to that?

324
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,959
I didn't tell my family that I was

325
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,800
involved with Damian for four years.

326
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,079
You didn't tell them.

327
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,360
How can you not tell your parents that

328
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,519
you're dating and getting married to a

329
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,640
guy on death row? It does tend to come

330
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,720
up in conversation. Um, well, my

331
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,320
family's from West Virginia and and I

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,399
love my family and I'm very close with

333
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:14,639
them, but I just felt it necessary to

334
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,480
for for them and for me and Damian, I

335
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,880
needed to know what I was doing. I had

336
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,800
to I had to have a plan in place and

337
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,279
before I just went off spouting, I'm

338
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,519
marrying this guy on death row. I didn't

339
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,560
It's It could It was devastating for

340
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,560
them to hear that even four years later.

341
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,560
But at least I was able to emotionally

342
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,079
handle myself.

343
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
Did you really think he would get out of

344
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,200
jail?

345
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
I did.

346
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,320
But how why would you think that he's on

347
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,959
death row? I mean, maybe commuted to

348
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,440
life in prison or 40 years later he gets

349
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,959
free. It's almost biblical in scope, but

350
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,760
what what would make you think he'd get

351
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,399
completely free?

352
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,399
I have great faith.

353
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,240
And Damian, outside of Lori and and your

354
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,360
own, you know, who supported you? Who

355
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,079
was there for you?

356
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,760
Mostly it was Lori and and people that,

357
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,079
you know, we became friends with over

358
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,360
the years like Johnny Depp, Eddie Veter,

359
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,519
Peter Jackson, you know, people that

360
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,600
kind of became like family to us. My own

361
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,440
family, they weren't really capable of

362
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,639
of offering any kind of support or

363
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
anything else. You know, when I was

364
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,320
born, my mother was like 15, my father

365
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,079
was 16, so they're barely more than

366
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,639
children themselves, living these lives

367
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,079
of absolute grinding poverty. They

368
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
couldn't even afford to come see me at

369
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,760
the prison. You know, the prison is

370
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,519
several hours away from the town where

371
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,399
they lived and they had no way of even

372
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,639
getting there.

373
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,160
So, against all odds, you're freed. What

374
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,800
was that moment like when you stepped

375
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,279
outside the prison walls after having

376
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,160
been in a 9 by12 confined cell for many

377
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,920
of the years?

378
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,160
This is another thing that is almost

379
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,959
impossible for me to make people

380
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,200
understand. I can barely remember the

381
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,120
first two years I was out of prison. In

382
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,120
hindsight, I was probably suffering from

383
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,720
what people call a nervous breakdown and

384
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,240
didn't realize it at the time.

385
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,120
And how are you doing now being out of

386
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,519
prison?

387
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,199
I think my I am probably happier now

388
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,079
than I've ever been in my life. You

389
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,079
know, it's Thank you.

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,440
Why

391
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,760
I part of what happened whenever I got

392
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,600
out um like I said, I was

393
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,160
psychologically shattered. I could not

394
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,519
read like I would I lost all ability to

395
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,360
read. I would read the same page of a

396
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,720
book over and over and could not retain

397
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,040
what I had read when I got to the bottom

398
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,959
of the page. I would reintroduce myself

399
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,399
to the same person over and over because

400
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,600
I could not even remember having dinner

401
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,959
with them the night before. Um, and you

402
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,199
know, my spiritual practice was the core

403
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,560
of my life when I was in prison. You

404
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,480
know, I was I was doing some of these

405
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,920
techniques, these meditations, these

406
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,680
visualizations for like eight hours a

407
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,360
day. When I walked out of prison, I was

408
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,480
so destroyed that I could not even do it

409
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,880
for eight minutes. That was part of of

410
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,959
what made life out here so hard. I had

411
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,639
to work my way gradually back up to

412
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,800
being able to do the same things I was

413
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,360
doing in prison. And that's a huge part

414
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,360
of what made my life more stable again.

415
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,720
This is a fascinating conversation. I

416
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,880
the fact that you were behind prison is

417
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,720
tragic, but the recovery itself from a

418
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,880
physician's perspective, I mean, it's

419
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,199
life-changing. Up next, a shocking truth

420
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,880
behind why Damian will never truly be a

421
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,600
free man. Why not? Why? When we come

422
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,440
back. We're back with former West

423
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Memphis 3 inmate Damen Eckles and his

424
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,920
wife Lori. Now Damian spent 18 years on

425
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,079
death row waiting to be executed by

426
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,639
lethal injection while his wife fought

427
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,959
to set him free. Damian, do you ever any

428
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,880
flashbacks to the time in prison? Times

429
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,320
when you when you had a lot of

430
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,560
difficulty. It was very dark. How have

431
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,959
you learned to cope with that drama?

432
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,279
You know, really I I I wouldn't call

433
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,279
them flashbacks, but I still have

434
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,000
nightmares sometimes. That that's the

435
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,320
main thing. I I have dreams. Uh, and and

436
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,399
in my dreams, it's not only so much that

437
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,839
I'm back in prison, but you know, like I

438
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,120
said, it was my spiritual practice that

439
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,199
allowed me to survive that. In my

440
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,720
dreams, I don't have that to rely on.

441
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,639
It's like I've forgotten everything and

442
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,959
I'm just a victim of all the forces

443
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,360
going on around me. So, it's like doubly

444
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,600
traumatic. Um, I did have other things

445
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,519
whenever I first got out like, uh, any

446
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,079
little thing that would startle me would

447
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,680
trigger PTSD like symptoms. Like it

448
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,360
could be anything from, you know, I

449
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,680
would almost there were there was a time

450
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,519
I almost punched a car because a guy

451
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,959
clicked his alarm and it scared me so

452
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
bad. You know, just the sudden noise of

453
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,839
it. Just Exactly. Things like that. As

454
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,600
time has went on, I've been out almost

455
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,160
eight years now and as time has went on

456
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,639
that grows less and less and less.

457
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,120
You have some insights into what happens

458
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,959
in the prison that we all need to hear.

459
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,800
which gave me a whole new way of

460
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,279
thinking about what we're doing. The

461
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
folks who are behind bars,

462
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,320
you know, the the one thing that I

463
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,320
always try to get across to people is in

464
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,160
the almost 20 years that I was in there,

465
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,399
I never saw I I did not see one single

466
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,199
shred of anything that could be even

467
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,320
remotely considered uh any sort of

468
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,399
rehabilitative program. Um and and

469
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,480
that's pretty much life in there.

470
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,799
My goodness. So, you're no longer behind

471
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,400
bars, but I don't want people to sit

472
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,919
here and think Damian is an innocent man

473
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,799
because you're not considered to be a

474
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,760
free man.

475
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,039
That's That's correct.

476
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,640
Please explain why you have not been

477
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,319
exonerated, even though that does seem

478
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,319
to be what everyone thinks.

479
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,919
We what happened in our case, I had

480
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,919
never heard of this thing before our

481
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,760
case. It was completely new to me. We

482
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,600
were uh given what's called an Alfred

483
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,120
plea. In our case, what happened is

484
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,280
they, you know, when I was arrested in

485
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,120
1993, they could not do the same kind of

486
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,960
DNA testing back then that they can do

487
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,720
now. So whenever they finally started

488
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
doing DNA testing and found that it

489
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,160
didn't match me or the other two guys

490
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,720
they convicted. We had new eyewitnesses

491
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,320
come forth and put the person that the

492
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,840
DNA did match with all three of the

493
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
victims within an hour of the time they

494
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,440
were murdered. The state still did not

495
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,880
want to let us go. To this day, no one's

496
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,880
ever been exonerated from death row in

497
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,120
the state of Arkansas ever.

498
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720
They wanted to maintain that record. We

499
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,919
were given what's called an Alfred plea.

500
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,480
An Alfred plea means you are

501
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,480
accepting a guilty plea while still

502
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,720
being legally allowed to maintain your

503
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,720
innocence. It makes no sense whatsoever.

504
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,400
And the entire reason that this thing

505
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,160
exists is so that the state can't be

506
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,120
held responsible and doesn't have to pay

507
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,720
you any sort of compensation.

508
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,799
I mean, we got a problem here. I you

509
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,559
can't vote, right? You can't get a job.

510
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,000
Hard to travel. You don't get

511
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,039
compensation, which I frankly think

512
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,400
you're deserving of that. But

513
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,840
independence, you can't even earn for

514
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,120
yourself, which is a bigger problem.

515
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,559
Exactly. So the offer plea was

516
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,120
originally designed so you could take

517
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,960
people who should have gone to death row

518
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,039
and give them life in prison for copying

519
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,799
a plea. You save everyone time, money,

520
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,080
and it sort of made sense. It wasn't

521
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,480
designed to be used for someone like

522
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,520
you.

523
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,799
Exactly.

524
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,559
There's someone else who was pivotal in

525
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,840
getting you out of prison. And we had a

526
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,760
chance to talk to him very recently. His

527
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,000
name is John Douglas. He's considered

528
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,400
the original mind hunter and he created

529
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,919
the original criminal profile and helped

530
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,280
you with your release. Now when I heard

531
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,559
the story, I was stunned. But he

532
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,200
recently was here and he had a few

533
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,919
things to say to you. Take a look.

534
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,760
Damian is a survivor. He's he he was a

535
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,919
victim of this crime. Wrongfully

536
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,320
convicted. I'm really proud proud of

537
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,120
him. He's just a wonderful uh

538
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,840
individual. Extremely bright bright uh

539
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,360
and and what a waste of talent for these

540
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,960
past 18 years when he was incarcerated.

541
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,120
What's it like hearing that? I mean, the

542
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,000
guy's a world famous worldass

543
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,919
individual.

544
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,840
He is. But not only is he that, he is

545
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,200
also kind. He's one of the kindest

546
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,799
people you'll come across, which was

547
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,120
something that meant a lot to me because

548
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,360
after everything I'd been through, I

549
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,919
started to look at anyone who was

550
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,840
remotely involved in the field of law

551
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,200
enforcement as the enemy. These were the

552
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,120
people who tried to murder me. These

553
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,520
were the people who tried to cover up

554
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,120
evidence to make sure that I was killed.

555
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,080
So, whenever you meet someone like John

556
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,000
Douglas, you realize not everyone in

557
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,720
that community is a bad guy. Some of

558
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,400
these people do actually want to see

559
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,240
justice. some of these people do

560
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,440
actually care about you as a human

561
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,960
being. So he John Douglas is is at least

562
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,360
partly responsible for restoring some of

563
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,400
my faith in the American judicial

564
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,240
system.

565
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,840
So Damian Jason Jesse the three men

566
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,360
arrested were victims of a broken

567
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,440
system. That's what it seems like to me

568
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,919
anyway and folks have investigated this.

569
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,240
Whoever killed those kids, what happened

570
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,080
to them? We don't know. They didn't go

571
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,919
to jail. So they could have killed

572
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,679
again. And we can't forget the three

573
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,840
boys that lost their lives. They still

574
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,600
have not gotten justice. What would that

575
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,039
word justice mean to you, Damian?

576
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
You know, whenever people ask me that,

577
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,480
the the only thing I can say is that

578
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,320
there there can be no justice in this

579
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,240
case. You know, you there may be a sense

580
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,000
of closure. You know, if they arrest the

581
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,120
right person, if they exonerate me and

582
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,280
the other two guys, that would be a

583
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,600
sense of closure, but it's not justice.

584
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,840
Justice is not going to give me back 20

585
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,840
years of my life or undo all of the

586
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,600
trauma that I experienced. Justice is

587
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,640
not going to bring those three children

588
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,799
back. You know, even there there's all

589
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,880
the ramifications and the ripples that

590
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,200
were created by the devastation that

591
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,720
this case brought. I now have a

592
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,480
grandson. I never even got a chance to

593
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,720
know my son or my grandson. He grew up

594
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,400
without a father. Nothing is ever going

595
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,600
to give us that opportunity again.

596
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,559
Nothing is ever going to bring that

597
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,000
back. There can be no justice in this

598
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,200
case.

599
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
But closure is there.

600
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,880
Closure.

601
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,720
At least that was something we can seek.

602
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,400
