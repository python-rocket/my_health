00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,720
[Applause]

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,160
It's the latest health trend that

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,919
everybody is talking about, CBD oil.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,519
Now, it comes from the cannabis plant,

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,599
and many believe it can help with

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,320
everything from anxiety and chronic pain

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,440
to diabetes, even cancer. We're in the

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,680
midst of a CBD oil boom with products

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,600
popping up everywhere. Today, Dr. Sanjay

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,640
Gupta is here to investigate what

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,400
exactly is CBD oil and does it live up

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,960
to the hype. But first, I asked

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,800
correspondent Marsh Evocmpo to find out

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,520
how big CBD has truly become.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,239
CBD, if you haven't heard of it yet, you

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,800
probably will soon. The natural herb is

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,879
taking the health world by storm with

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,120
sales of the new supplement expected to

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,120
grow 700% in the next 2 years. Wow. You

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,200
just see great review after great

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,480
review. I mean, people seem to love this

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,000
stuff. 4,000 reviews, four and a half

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,559
stars. Short for canidiol, CBD is a

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,920
component of the cannabis plant. Yep,

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,880
cannabis. But unlike marijuana, CBD does

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,320
not contain any THC, the psychoactive

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,479
part of the plant, so it doesn't get you

28
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,479
high. Over the last few years, CBD has

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,439
started popping up in everything from

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,280
gummies to face cream to toothpaste.

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,920
There are even CBD treats for your pet.

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,640
So, what does it do? Research has been

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,640
limited, but proponents say CBD has all

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,040
the benefits of medical marijuana

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,439
without the intoxicating effects,

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,520
helping with insomnia, pain management,

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,680
and anxiety. There's a revolution, a

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,640
whole movement happening now with

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,040
plant-based wellness, which is our

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,159
primary interest, celebrating the power

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,320
of all plants, which have not been

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,560
properly represented. And the question

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,640
everyone asks is, is it legal?

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,439
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's medical

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,799
correspondent, the chief

46
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,960
one and as reporter on the latest

47
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
research behind CBD. So, you know what?

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,719
Break this down for everybody. I'd like

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,160
to take your thoughts on what it really

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
is so people can get this into their

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
heads. Well, you think about the

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
cannabis plant, marijuana. It's called

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
cannabis. Um, it really has lots of

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,599
different ingredients, but two primary

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,440
ones. One is THC. That's the stuff

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,840
that's the recreational drug. It's what

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,879
gets people high, gives them that

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,000
euphoria. And their CBD, which is

59
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,920
cannibidol, it's it's something that

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,920
doesn't cause a psychoactive component.

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,319
It's believed to be a medicine. It's

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
been used as a medicine in decades past,

63
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,319
and it's getting this resurgence, as you

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,840
just heard. So, just to be clear, we've

65
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,400
talked about medical marijuana in the

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,560
past. This is not that, right? CBD oil

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,239
is being sold all over the place. You

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
you you take the plant and you can pull

69
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,440
out certain components of it. So you're

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,760
just pull in this case, you're pulling

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,840
out the CBD component and you're just

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,519
using that and and therefore you're not

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,040
getting all those other effects that

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,800
people often associate with marijuana,

75
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,800
which is why I think 47 states so far

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,040
have said we're okay with it. How is the

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
medical community using CBD oil? This is

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
fascinating to me. I mean, if you would

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,519
asked this question 5 years ago, it

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
would have basically been crickets.

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,239
Nobody was really talking about it.

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,159
Within the last 5 years, uh you you had

83
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,000
a medication that was sort of known

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,720
colloially as Charlotte's Web. It was

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,319
for this little girl who had seizures uh

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,000
that just could not be treated by all

87
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,080
these different medicines she took. Her

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,560
mom essentially started taking CBD

89
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,879
herself in her kitchen sink and giving

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,640
it to her daughter. That is what was

91
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,799
known as Charlotte's Web. Within 5

92
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,640
years, it's gone from being that idea to

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,560
now an FDA approved drug in this

94
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,599
country. That that's fast. That's never

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,599
really happened that quick. The

96
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,519
government has approved a ver a one CBD

97
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,440
oil for one indication. Yes. And this is

98
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,760
from the plant. This isn't synthesized

99
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,959
in some lab. This is CBD that's actually

100
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,040
coming from the plant, from the

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,720
botanical. So that that that's a big

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,400
deal. You actually now have something

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,959
that's been considered illegal at the

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
federal level, also part of an FDA

105
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,080
approved drug. That's that's that's what

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
we're dealing with in this country. Can

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,799
you guys wrap your heads around this?

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,159
It's this is part of the disconnect,

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,200
right? The the federal government says

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,840
it's not legal. 47 states say it is.

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,040
Kids with seizures are being treated. I

112
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,040
mean, FDA says yes, we'll approve it.

113
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
But but still at the federal level, it's

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,280
illegal. What is starting to gain more

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,040
traction, I think, really is what's

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
happening with opioids in this country.

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,160
What they found, uh, Dr. Oz, was that in

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,199
several states that had approved CBD

119
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,199
legislation, they saw their opioid

120
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
prescriptions start to go down. So,

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,960
that's that's an area the medical

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,040
community is really really focused on.

123
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,120
As as a neurosurgeon, you you're good at

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
this stuff. Explain to me how CBD

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
actually affects the body. Well, we have

126
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,360
all these different receptors in our

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,919
bodies uh to to basically attract and to

128
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,280
have these these components activate,

129
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,199
but because those receptors are

130
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,720
everywhere in the body, you could get an

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,919
impact just about anywhere. Actually,

132
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,199
let's show this to everybody because I

133
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,479
made a little model to demonstrate what

134
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,320
Sanjay is saying. CBD produces so many

135
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,759
effects throughout the body based on the

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,199
fact it can bind to receptors in so many

137
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,880
of our different organs, right? Places

138
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
as far away as the intestinal tract and

139
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
your arm and your spinal column up up

140
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,600
into your brain. And that's why people

141
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,520
say it helps them alleviate pain, right?

142
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,520
Maybe help with seizures. It's a pretty

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,759
serious problem for a lot of folks.

144
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,120
Anxiety, pretty common problem that we

145
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,960
don't want to treat if we don't have to.

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,560
Even withdrawal from medications, maybe

147
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,240
even the opiates as San Andre mentioned,

148
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,320
but think about that. People think it

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,240
can do so many things because of the CBD

150
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,080
oil that is in there is touching so many

151
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,960
parts of our body. And I love your

152
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,560
thought that we evolved as as species

153
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,080
because we had access to these natural

154
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
plants and they understandably can

155
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,440
affect us. That's right. And we and the

156
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,759
receptors started to evolve in our body

157
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,960
as well. We even started making our own

158
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,320
form of CBD in our body. But sometimes

159
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,000
it's not enough just like other things

160
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,080
aren't enough in our body and that's why

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,919
some people seem to get benefit. So the

162
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,919
question then becomes do they work? So

163
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,360
there are products of CBD oil which

164
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,199
again you saw the theoretical argument

165
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,000
you just made but these products are

166
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,160
popping up everywhere and some of these

167
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,520
are everyday items that you can buy. I

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
have a bunch in front of him. Yeah, we

169
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
don't Sanjay and I don't sell anything

170
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
in the space, but they're shampoos,

171
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,080
their supplements, their gummies, their

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,680
muscle soothing creams, they're even

173
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,840
products with your pets, as you saw from

174
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,080
Mara's report. So, when you look at

175
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,759
this, Sanjay, and you realize as a as a

176
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,199
clinician how complicated CBD could be,

177
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,639
how do you decide which of these might

178
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,840
work? Well, you know, you know, it's

179
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,440
interesting. I'll tell you this, I think

180
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,960
in part uh from a physician's

181
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
perspective. First of all, I think that

182
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,319
there's a a legitimate medicine in here.

183
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,240
I think we're talking about something

184
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,840
that could actually really help people.

185
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,680
And I worry a little bit when you start

186
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,680
to see products like this that it could

187
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
minimize the importance of what CBD

188
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
could do for people because I don't know

189
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
what these products are. I don't know

190
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,240
what's in them. I don't know how much of

191
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
anything is in them. I don't know if

192
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,280
they they would actually do anything. I

193
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,120
mean, this is CBD shampoo. If I could

194
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,960
get shampoo like Dr. Oz, I'd probably

195
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,639
use it. But, you know, other than that,

196
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,800
uh, I'm not I coveret your hair. You

197
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,400
should go. I'm not sure, though. I I I

198
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,680
would have a hard time if somebody came

199
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,840
to me and said, "Hey, should I take this

200
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,440
CBD product?" as much reporting as I've

201
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,199
done on it, I would still have a hard

202
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,240
time, you know, saying that it's a good

203
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,000
idea. So the FDA is in charge, in fact,

204
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,120
it's charged by our nation to tell us

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
the answer to that question. What's

206
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,479
safe? What's not? Where are they with

207
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,720
all these things? They they So this is

208
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,360
an illegal substance at the national

209
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
level. This is illegal. Illegal. At the

210
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,880
same time, as you as we talked about

211
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,400
earlier, the FDA has said, you know

212
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,599
what, we think there's enough of a

213
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
benefit here that we're willing to

214
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,560
approve a drug specifically for epilepsy

215
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,000
that's based on CBD. And part of what

216
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
reason I wanted to cover this topic is

217
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
you can buy these products anywhere

218
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,759
really. You can go down your local, you

219
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,199
know, store in 47 out of 50 states, buy

220
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
it online pretty much anywhere you want.

221
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,479
And the government's not going to come

222
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
in and kick your door down. So whatever

223
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,160
they say in the, you know, at the

224
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,520
highest levels, we're still not actually

225
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,800
doing anything to stop people from using

226
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,039
these, which is a concern to me because

227
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,479
it's the wild wild west. It's completely

228
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,680
unregulated. That's right. So if it does

229
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,880
have all the potential that we're

230
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
talking about today, I want to

231
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,560
understand what could be in your best

232
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,400
interest with CBD oil. Up next, we're

233
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,039
going to continue our investigation. How

234
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,039
much CBD is actually in these products

235
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,080
and can it really work for you? We have

236
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,680
the test results and they might surprise

237
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,080
you. I'm back with Dr. Sanjay Gupta

238
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,560
investigating the CBD oil boom that's

239
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,560
now a 1 billion with a B billion dollar

240
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,599
industry and CBD sales are expected to

241
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,759
grow 700% in the next two years. I mean,

242
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,960
that's shocking. Proponents say CBD can

243
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,440
be used to treat everything from

244
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,440
anxiety, chronic pain to epileptic

245
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,400
seizures, even cancer. products like

246
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
these, the ones in front of us here,

247
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
they're widely available stores and

248
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,440
online, but are you getting what you're

249
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,039
paying for? So, where's the research?

250
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,960
You know, I I hear it talked about so

251
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,840
much, but whenever I, you know, get

252
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,279
called by somebody, I want to know

253
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,800
what's the actual data that shows that

254
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,240
it work. And you can't find that much.

255
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,479
It's it's very hard to find the data. I

256
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,919
think on epilepsy, seizures,

257
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,919
particularly ones that have not been

258
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,200
treatable by existing medications,

259
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,040
there's there's pretty good data. That's

260
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,160
why the FDA approved the drug. But just

261
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,920
about any of those other things you

262
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,040
mentioned, the anxiety, the sleep, even

263
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,360
pain, the CBD only research is pretty

264
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,800
limited. Let let me say though, part of

265
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,240
that doesn't you shouldn't immediately

266
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,080
say, well, it doesn't work because of

267
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,839
that. Uh part of it is that the research

268
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,480
is hard to do. If you have a substance

269
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,160
that is illegal at the federal level,

270
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,360
how do you get research done on it? It's

271
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,120
very hard to get people to actually

272
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,959
invest in that research. That's part of

273
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,040
the problem here. And rarely have I been

274
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,320
called by as many people saying it's

275
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,760
helped them. Yeah, these are folks who

276
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,279
don't have a vested interest. So it

277
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,640
makes me really curious and as a

278
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,160
physician I feel frustrated that we

279
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,160
haven't done more right to help them

280
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,680
out. Yeah. Absolutely. No, I mean we

281
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,880
need we need to get that research done.

282
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
Absolutely. So let me introduce you to

283
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,240
Dr. Todd Cuberman's founder of

284
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,920
consumerlab.com.

285
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,000
They do all the work so you don't have

286
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,760
to. And they've tested the most popular

287
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,880
CBD products on the market. Well, first

288
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
of all, you have a lot of things you

289
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,399
could be testing. Why did you decide to

290
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,480
look at CBD oil? Uh as you were saying,

291
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,080
CBD has become super popular. So, the

292
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
readers of Consumer Lab have been asking

293
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,160
us really what's in these products

294
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,800
because, you know, as you mentioned,

295
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,800
since it's illegal, um, if a product

296
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,519
actually says CBD and the amount on it,

297
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,200
the FDA will go after them as calling it

298
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,560
an unapproved drug. All right, let's

299
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,080
break it down. We have all the data

300
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,760
here. I'm fascinated to see what you

301
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,640
got. First, we wanted to actually figure

302
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,560
out how much CBD is in the CBD oil

303
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,200
product, right? So, how how much

304
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,279
consistency was there? Right. So, uh, we

305
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,360
found over over a 10-fold difference

306
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,080
between products. We found 10fold. Yeah.

307
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,800
As little as 2 milligs to up to 22

308
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,880
milligs in a suggested serving. So, some

309
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,600
of them had this much. Some of them had

310
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,760
that much. Right. It's stunning to me.

311
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,519
Are you surprised by this? I I'm I'm

312
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,120
pretty surprised. I I think the the idea

313
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
that you have no idea what you're

314
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,839
getting, if you're even getting it at

315
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,920
all. I mean, that's that's not even a

316
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,000
real probable dose. If you need hundreds

317
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,600
of milligrams for it to do anything, 2

318
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,800
milligrams not going to do anything. And

319
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
yet people are paying a lot of money for

320
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,279
it. What about the cost? Yeah, so on the

321
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,160
cost, we found that the price uh for a

322
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,880
10 milligram dose um ranged from as

323
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,040
little as 80ents to up to 400, sorry,

324
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,040
not 400,

325
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,440
$4.50 for the same amount of CBD. So

326
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,800
again, you know, you can if you if you

327
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,279
know what to look for, you can get it

328
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,839
for a lot less than than the 450. I can

329
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,399
give a 10 times difference in price for

330
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,959
the same is it different CBD? Um, you

331
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,959
know, it it it's really this it's the

332
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,040
amount of CBD. It's same amount of 10

333
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,880
milligrams of CBD in each product. Some

334
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,279
can have a little bit of CBDA, which is

335
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,279
kind of a precursor, but that's really

336
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,720
for amount of C same amount of CBD. And

337
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,279
what about this issue of toxins,

338
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,440
contaminants, heavy metals, right? Well,

339
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,720
good news. Um, none of the nine products

340
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,600
that we tested, and these are products

341
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,760
for people and and animals, um, taken

342
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,079
orally as pills or liquids, none of them

343
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
had any uh heavy metal contamination.

344
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,519
None of them had any any significant

345
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,800
amount of THC. So when you look at all

346
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,839
these products, you do you find that

347
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,440
they're adequately labeled? No, not no.

348
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,000
I mean, very few products are actually

349
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,560
labeled appropriately um in terms of the

350
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,079
amount of CBD. U most you won't know.

351
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,839
And and when you look at the labels,

352
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,160
they often won't say the amount of CBD,

353
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,079
so they'll use other terms like hemp

354
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,399
extract. That typically means they are

355
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,920
extracting some some CBD from from the

356
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,720
plant and you're getting some. If it

357
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,680
says just hemp oil, you're getting none.

358
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,680
Hemp oil has no CBD in it. Um, they will

359
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,440
often put it in hemp oil. So, you'll

360
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,360
have hemp extract with hemp oil. Oh my

361
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,360
goodness. It gets kind of confusing.

362
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,560
Folks, if you don't understand something

363
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,320
these days, it's because they don't want

364
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,240
you to understand it. It's not an

365
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,360
accident, which is a problem because I

366
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
really deep in my heart agree with

367
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,639
Sanjay that there's a medicinal benefit.

368
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,959
This stuff's been around since the dawn

369
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,399
of humanity and I don't appreciate the

370
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,959
fact that we can't even figure out the

371
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,120
basic rules to give you advice with. So,

372
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,560
give me your bottom line here. CBD oils.

373
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,079
What would you do right now if you if

374
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
you had a problem? The one of the ones

375
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,920
we listed. I I think that other than the

376
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,839
things that have actually been tested,

377
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,600
um you you're really probably better off

378
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,800
saving your money. I think ultimately

379
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,920
we're going to we're going to get more

380
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,680
information about this. It's going to

381
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,519
have to happen. There's too much sort of

382
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,279
anecdotal evidence of how this might

383
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,880
work. Right now, you're not even sure if

384
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,560
you're getting CBD, how much you're

385
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,920
getting of it. In these cases, the

386
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160
products were safe, but sometimes they

387
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,079
may be contaminated with heavy metals.

388
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,200
People say regulation is a bad thing. I

389
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,720
think when it comes to this, it's

390
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,560
probably a good thing because if there's

391
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,160
regulation, it's going to force these

392
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,639
these these people who are making these

393
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,160
products to list it to to stand by it

394
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,680
and to make sure that they're safe. It

395
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,880
rewards the good guys. People who are

396
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,079
making high quality products will

397
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,680
benefit, I think, from having them have

398
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,200
scoundrels pushed out. Here's my

399
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,480
thought. They could work. I'm hearing

400
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,839
from too many of you right now that

401
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,959
they're getting benefits, but their

402
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,560
problem with how we access it. So, what

403
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,320
do you ought to do? Talk to your doc

404
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,519
about it. Get them to sit down with for

405
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,639
a second. Help them figure because

406
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,920
they'll help you. They understand this

407
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,680
stuff. They'll figure out which of these

408
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,120
CBD oils might make sense from you.

409
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,399
There are some reputable companies, I

410
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,160
suspect, that are beginning to get into

411
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,279
the medical community. But we've got to

412
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
make this happen. And it's not going to

413
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,079
happen from someone else doing it for

414
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,920
you. You got to step up in your own life

415
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,680
and do the investigation. For more

416
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,120
