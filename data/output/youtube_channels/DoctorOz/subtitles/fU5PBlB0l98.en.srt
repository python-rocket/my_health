body and help you start to lose the

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,720
weight. And we are so lucky today

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,439
because our go-to tester, the taste

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,840
tester galore, Natha, is here as always.

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,320
I trust her. But here's the thing. She

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,920
is stubborn. You know, she is she wants

40
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,119
to do the tetox, but she's a little bit

41
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,520
nervous. What worries you about

42
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,880
detoxing? Well, yeah, exactly. You see

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,479
my face? Mhm. No. Okay. First of all, I

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,479
hear tea. Like, what's what's going to

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,200
be happening? Am I drinking tea all day

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,720
for three days? Am I going to be hungry?

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,399
Is my stomach going to be bumbling? Is

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,680
my head going to be start hurting? You

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,439
know how sometimes you get hunger

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,320
headaches. Okay, I get the hunger

51
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,360
headaches out. So, you know, I'm a

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
little skeptical about this here

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,960
three-day tea. I But you know what? I'll

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,720
try anything for you, sugar. For me,

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,720
I'll give it a try. All right. Over here

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,480
on the plan. This is a plan for all of

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,000
you who are skeptical, celebrity

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,239
fitness, and nutrition expert, and

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,080
author of the sugar impact diet. DJ

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,959
Virgin helped create the plan for us.

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,200
Welcome to Gay. What makes Tox, the one

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,959
we've designed, safer than the packaged

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,800
pre kinds that people are buying online?

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,640
Yes. Well, those prepackaged ones, a lot

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,239
of them have senna in them, which

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
irritates your gut and gives you that

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,920
laxative effect and then you get

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,239
trapped. You have to use it all the

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,840
time. So, what we did instead, and don't

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,280
look at so skeptical, you're going to

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,599
love this. We took all of the best teas

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,080
and we combined them with food. So,

73
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,080
you're going to get comfort detox food.

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,959
Yes, you get to eat. You're not going to

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,720
be hungry. Okay, this this is detox

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,000
without the deprivation, okay? All

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,959
right, we don't want to starve you up.

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,480
That's the promise. We're not going to

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,160
starve you. But I don't want to clean

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,720
the pipes out in a healthy way. And so

81
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,400
the food pairings with the tea makes a

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,000
difference. All right. Three-day detox

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,879
plan approved by Oz begins with

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,840
dandelion and milk thistle, blended tea.

85
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,440
But you got to do this when you first

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,599
wake up. Jig, explain why you put them

87
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,239
together. All right. So, you got to have

88
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,440
good liver support when you're detoxing.

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,959
And that is why milk thistle and

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,200
dandelion are so great. Now, if you're

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,239
going to wake up, have this hour or two

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,760
later. So, we're going to start with

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
breakfast. And this breakfast is very

94
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,400
special just for you. Bone broth,

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
oatmeal. Okay. Now, the foundation is

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
still cut oats and bone broth, but you

97
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,200
can add all the other things here,

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,959
right? Yes. Yes. So, this makes it This

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,159
is like your canvas to create. But

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
what's so important here is the

101
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,200
oatmeal's got beta glucan soluble fiber.

102
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,280
It's like sponges. Okay. And I love it

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,680
with the walnuts for a little crunch.

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,319
The chia that makes a great texture. Can

105
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,000
I add bacon bits for crunch? No.

106
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,920
after after the tea talks. So, I have to

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,640
stick to the three days. Anything for

108
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,879
three days. Okay. All right. Next, we

109
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,360
have an Oz approved three-day tea with

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,120
fennel seed ginger tea at lunchtime.

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,959
Again, we have a pairing, right? We have

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,159
a breakfast tea. 2 hours later, you have

113
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,519
a breakfast bone broth and oatmeal,

114
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,360
which I like. Actually, you do too.

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,120
Really, no bacon. And then you have the

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,360
fennel ginger. Okay. All right. Because

117
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,640
lunch is your biggest meal of the day

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,920
and we want to make sure, you know,

119
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,440
we're adding some veggies. We're adding

120
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,959
some fiber. So, we've got to support

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,880
your digestion. We don't want you

122
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,600
bloated. So, that's why ginger and

123
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,600
fennel are so important here. Oh, this

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,280
is almost gone. Yeah. There's no boost

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,199
away. There's no alcohol in that. All

126
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,360
right. Now, the perfect lunch for this

127
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,960
detox is a low calorie, low carb soup.

128
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,400
Soups are good in general on a detox

129
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,919
because take the chewing out of it,

130
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,440
right? They rest your gut. Take a look

131
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,040
at JJ's. This is one of her favorite

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,160
creations. I love it. Roasted

133
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,160
cauliflower detox soup.

134
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:29,280
[Music]

135
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,919
Next on the oz approved 3day tea docs,

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,039
sip on green tea. cucumber detox water

137
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,039
all afternoon long. This is critical,

138
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,479
vital because this is your fail safe if

139
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
you're starting to pass. Yes. All right.

140
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,400
So, this is amazing because the green

141
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
tea of course boosts your metabolism

142
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,320
again, but it's also calming. So, we're

143
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,320
going to add in a cup of cucumbers. Then

144
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,240
some lemons and then some mints

145
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,120
naturally sweet. And then if you are

146
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,800
daring enough, and I sense you might be,

147
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,880
a little dash of cayenne pepper. Again,

148
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,880
that helps boost your metabolism. Right.

149
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,880
All day long. I put a lot of cayenne in

150
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,120
yours.

151
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,160
Fix your dish. I can taste it. Fix your

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,600
great, right? A little sweet from the

153
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,160
mint. This is great. This is great. See,

154
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,240
now of course I have to have my my water

155
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,680
all day, but this is like spotted water.

156
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,400
You put this in the fridge. You can

157
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,280
drink it all day long, right? Yes. And I

158
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,280
wouldn't mind doing this all day long. I

159
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,039
can take a big jug of this just I can

160
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,639
make it in the morning, pour it in a

161
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,240
nice little water bottle jug, and just

162
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,199
carry it. Right. We win. We won this

163
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,280
round. The hero. The hero of the detox.

164
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
But we're not done yet, cuz up next,

165
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,720
dinner time's the hardest time to stay

166
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,639
strong in any detox. But guess what? We

167
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,650

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,599
looking for a jump start on weight loss

182
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,199
to stay motivated. So celebrity

183
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,599
nutritionist JJ Virgin came up with a

184
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,120
full meal plan for the TE's that you can

185
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,759
use to lose weight without feeling

186
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,280
hungry. The TTX plan. Let's talk dinner.

187
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,720
JJ, you got three letters to remember.

188
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,400
Three letters. That's easy to remember

189
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,440
when you're picking your dinner to match

190
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,960
up on the TTOX diet. They are FFP. All

191
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,120
right. So, this is super important

192
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,400
because you don't want to be hungry

193
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,520
after dinner. So, it's FFP for fat,

194
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,440
fiber, and protein. This is the magic

195
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,840
formula. This is the trifecta both for

196
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,560
blood sugar balance, but also to help

197
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,960
keep you full so you shut that kitchen.

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,120
Look at me. Shut the kitchen after

199
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,639
dinner. All right. All right. All right.

200
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,479
So, it looks like this. Fat for example,

201
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,560
could be olives, fiber, broccoli. Your

202
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,160
protein is your key issue of salmon. You

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,560
put them together. sheep pen dinner.

204
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,400
Easy, fast, simple. And again, this is

205
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,800
pretty comfortable for your body to deal

206
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,319
with. So, you're detoxing away and you

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,599
can get a little bit more rambunctious

208
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,120
at dinner time, but then again, the

209
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,479
kitchen closes. Okay. After that, you

210
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,599
have a after the dinner detox, you've

211
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,160
got tea. What do you recommend? Yes.

212
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,400
Now, this is super important because we

213
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,280
got to get you to go to sleep. Right.

214
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,840
Right. So, we are going to give you

215
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,879
Valyan tea. Have you ever tried Valyan

216
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,039
tea? Because it's a key part of the

217
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,479
three-day detox. Now, I've tried it,

218
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,319
right? But I've also tried um chamomile

219
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,160
um which is supposed to put me asleep

220
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,960
but it's just kind of just makes me

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,560
cozy. But this one right here, baby.

222
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,959
Okay. This one knock you out. Okay.

223
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,880
Knock you out. Okay. For centuries, this

224
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,800
has been used to help people get into

225
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,080
deep sleep faster and have better

226
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,839
quality sleep. So that's why it knocked

227
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,800
you out. Okay. All right. You got one

228
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,720
last question. I understand you're

229
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,000
always full of questions. So, you know,

230
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,760
I know I gave you a hard time all day

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,399
about the tetox. I'm But I'm getting

232
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,480
into it, Dr. Oz. But one thing you

233
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,560
didn't help me with is my sugar

234
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
cravings. I got a bag of candy in my bag

235
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
right now in the in the back. What What

236
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,040
I'm going to do about my sugar cravings.

237
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's do that cuz that'll destroy the

238
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,760
whole detox. All right. Well, I'm going

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,480
to go get your purse in a second. But

240
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,880
besides that, you get I'm taking the

241
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,839
candy. I call the police.

242
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,399
So So a lot of times sugar cravings come

243
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,080
because of stress. So, licorice tea is

244
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,720
awesome here because it actually takes

245
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,320
the pressure off your adrenal glands,

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,360
but you're also going to pair it with

247
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,480
some almond butter.

248
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,920
Oh, now almond butter is great because

249
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,080
it actually has a compound so you don't

250
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,920
even absorb as much of the fat. Oh, he's

251
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
warming up the I'm trying to. But in the

252
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,600
meantime, the key thing about this is

253
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
licorice is naturally sweet enough that

254
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,080
without adding a lot of extra stuff to

255
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,760
it, it'll give it just that little bit

256
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,880
of a reminder of what sweet is without

257
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,800
calories, without messing up your

258
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,839
program. Because the detox works if you

259
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,000
don't have sugar. That's the key

260
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,160
fundamental Okay. Right. Thank you very

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,920
much. Good luck to you my Tigers. Thank

262
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,920
you all. We're gonna put the entire plan

263
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,480
on dr.com so you can try it at home.

264
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,480
I'll be right back.

265
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,680
DNA, your genetic code. It'll tell me

266
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,920
what eye color they should have, hair

267
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,760
color, shape, face. Now, breakthrough

268
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,000
technology. Does it blow your mind?

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,080
She's tracking down cold case killers.

270
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,560
We know she's the mother of the suspect.

271
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,600
I love how bad guys get caught using

272
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,760
science. Plus, can low blood sugar

273
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,320
really lead to murder? They're actually

274
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:26,320
in an altered mental state. I don't buy

275
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,320
it. All new Oas. That's coming up

276
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,200
[Music]

277
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,959
[Applause]

278
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,519
tomorrow. We just introduced you to the

279
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,279
2019 Tea Talks to start off your new

280
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,839
year the right way. And now get ready to

281
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,920
take tea to the next level. Chefs all

282
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,760
around the world are using tea in new

283
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,480
ways to flavor foods without adding

284
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,079
loads of calories. Should you be cooking

285
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,839
with tea leaves? That's the big

286
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,800
question. Chef and tea lover Will

287
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,800
Gillson is here. He

288
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,640
knows. Explain why tea has so much

289
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,320
untapped potential for our viewers.

290
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,760
Well, Dr. Oz, I grew up on an herb farm,

291
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,720
so cooking with dried and aromatic

292
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,800
ingredients has been sort of the

293
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
backbone of my cuisine for most of my

294
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,320
life. But, you know, I think that

295
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
adding, you know, herbs into food, tea

296
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,680
is actually a way to enhance the flavor

297
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,040
even so much more. And I think, you

298
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
know, you probably have some tea at

299
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
home. Today, we're going to show you

300
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,800
that it's more than just a coffee

301
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,800
alternative. Yeah. If we use herbs,

302
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
which are dried thingamajigs, we should

303
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
use tea, which are dried thingamajigs.

304
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,200
We're going to show you the easiest ways

305
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,880
to start cooking with tea today and they

306
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,839
are all Oz approved. The first is to use

307
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,839
a tea broth to make pasta, rice, grains,

308
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,880
even oatmeal. So, what kind of tees do

309
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,399
you use? How do you actually make these

310
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,920
things? So with like a black tea, I

311
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,920
would use that to make, you know, into

312
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,959
sort of the infusion of making a rice

313
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,880
dish, something like that. Give that

314
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,120
nice toasty flavor. You know, the ulong

315
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,279
tea I actually infuse into milk to make

316
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,519
oatmeal with. Uh it's actually wonderful

317
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,519
background flavor. Uh and then green tea

318
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,800
I actually like to infuse into uh

319
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,480
broths. You know, basically making like

320
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,079
a chicken broth and you can use that to

321
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,440
make a soup, which is what you did here

322
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,120
today. Describe how you made this

323
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,040
specifically. So, we actually start with

324
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,399
a broth, lots of herbs, chicken stock,

325
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
and then we just infuse in a little

326
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,800
satchel of the green tea. Take it in

327
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,360
there for just about 5 10 minutes, take

328
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,839
it out. I heard you like soup. It's got

329
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,360
tons of body to it. It's a very fresh

330
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,839
flavor, and I tell you, it's very

331
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,440
exotic. I've never expected an herb to

332
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,800
taste like this. If you tell me it's

333
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,079
tea, I'll figure it out. But I wouldn't

334
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,480
have otherwise. I think this is what's

335
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,920
going to be in your tea in 2019. Hot.

336
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,519
Remember the the highlights here. This

337
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,920
one's going to be what? Okay. But it's

338
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,519
basically chicken noodle soup with broth

339
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,800
made from tea. Yeah. I mean I I would

340
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,240
look at it this way. I mean like it's

341
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,800
basically like bone broth was the thing

342
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,800
that everybody was into in 2018, 2017,

343
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,240
2019. It's tea broth. The new bone

344
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
broth. The new bone broth. Tea broth.

345
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,680
Yes. Next.

346
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,000
While you got the tea in the house, we

347
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,360
want you to infuse your oil with tea.

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,639
And this adds a whole new dimension to

349
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
cooking at home. Yeah. Yeah. So, you

350
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
know, maybe you know this past holiday

351
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,279
season you got some tea as a gift. It's

352
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,480
sitting in your cupboard. You don't

353
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,760
really know what to do with it. You

354
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,360
know, this is actually, I think, the

355
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,320
most approachable and easy way to start

356
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
learning how to cook with tea. All

357
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,639
right. So, specifically, how do you do

358
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,160
you just add it to the oil? Do you have

359
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,360
to do anything else? Uh, you actually

360
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,800
just take the, you know, I like

361
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,399
extravirgin olive oil, as you know, it's

362
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,399
really great, very healthy. I just

363
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,000
lightly warm it, whisk the tea leaves

364
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,120
into that, let it steep for about 20

365
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,880
minutes, and then you're ready to go.

366
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,720
You can drizzle it on top of feta cheese

367
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,160
or even finish off a roast lamb with it.

368
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,639
How many of you guys a little uncertain

369
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,600
about tea leaves in your olive oil? Come

370
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,120
on, be honest. I thought so.

371
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,959
I'm gonna let you guys be the judges.

372
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,040
Take some of these toast here. Trust me

373
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,720
on this. Yes. Trust trust the chef here.

374
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,600
Pass that down. See what you guys think.

375
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,680
Now, I want some honest opinions

376
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,760
here. What's your first name? Nina.

377
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,839
Nina. And Lorraine. Lorraine. So, what

378
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,160
do you look for when you're trying to

379
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,760
use new techniques in your cooking? If I

380
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,320
was going to try to get you to use tea,

381
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,320
what would it take? Well, it's the idea

382
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,240
of it's something a little different, a

383
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,360
little different flavor, something

384
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,880
infused. Love the idea. So, I think that

385
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,920
would be something I would try. The

386
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,000
taste. What do you think of that?

387
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,079
Delicious. You like it? Yeah. You agree?

388
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
So surprising, isn't it? Absolutely. Who

389
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,560
would have thought? Chef, if you can

390
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,399
impress my audience, you can impress

391
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,279
anybody. See, they're on board. Nice

392
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,519
job. All right. Last up, we want you to

393
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,600
use tea in marinating your meats and

394
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,959
fish. Use it as a rub. Yeah. You know, I

395
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,560
think that one of the things that, you

396
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,160
know, you can find in rubs most of the

397
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,839
time is that, you know, you need to

398
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,320
enhance not just the flavor, but also

399
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,000
the texture. This is spectacular, right?

400
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,839
It's got a little tartness to it. How do

401
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,680
you make it? So, you know, I think you

402
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,839
know, a standard rub, you start with

403
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,519
usually salt, brown sugar, some dried

404
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,040
garlic, and then you can add in your

405
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,079
favorite tea. You can add in the mint

406
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,839
tea. You can add in a little bit of

407
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,360
jasmine tea. But this this is smoky a

408
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,440
little bit. Or you can use my favorite

409
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,760
tea, which is lapsang such tea. What?

410
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,480
Say again. Say again. Lapsang such tea.

411
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,639
Lapsang such tea. Yeah. Is that why it's

412
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,560
smoky? So, it's actually a black tea

413
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,160
that's dried over burning pine resin.

414
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,760
So, it gets this kind of cedar quality

415
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,880
to it. You can put it on there. I bet

416
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,399
that tastes like it's been grilled,

417
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,600
doesn't it? It does. It's fantastic.

418
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
Never hit the grill. Just right in the

419
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,920
oven. What? Here's what I'm taking away

420
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,160
from this. You take these basic tea in

421
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,839
plant. You can process it in different

422
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,480
ways. We can avoid having to add that

423
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,959
liquid smoky flavor now by using the

424
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,040
lapsang shang tea. Plus, people are so

425
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,279
impressed you can say it. Exactly. Who

426
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,639
wants some laps? Everybody, right?

427
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,959
Everybody. You're all going home with

428
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,560
some chef. Thank you very much. You can

433
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,920
[Applause]

434
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,000
up a little bit? I love getting to talk

435
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,160
with you on my show every single day,

436
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,560
but when the cameras stop rolling, the

437
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,320
conversation is not over. I still have a

438
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,720
lot that I want to talk about. So

439
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,460
download the Dr. Oz podcast on Apple

440
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,700
Podcast or wherever you get your

441
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,950
[Applause]

442
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,279
[Music]

443
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,279
[Applause]

444
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,639
podcast. Wrinkles. I know how much you

445
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,880
hate them and how you wish they would

446
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,680
just vanish. But I was surprised to hear

447
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,480
what so many of you refer to them as,

448
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,600
the accordion cheek. Yes, I've heard

449
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,920
this. Then there's the angry 11. Boom.

450
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,120
Right between the eyes. And of course,

451
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,320
the smiling staircase where your ey

452
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,079
lines start to slide down your face. So

453
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,560
regardless of what you may call your

454
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,320
wrinkles, there may be hope. Our new

455
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,399
non-invasive wrinkle fighters, the

456
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,240
future of skincare. My trusted

457
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,000
sponsorship partner, Number Seven, says

458
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,920
yes. And here to tell us more is

459
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,320
dermatologist Dr. Doris Day, who's here

460
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,759
on behalf of Number Seven. You're a

461
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,680
dermatologist. Why are these

462
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,279
non-invasive treatments becoming so

463
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,759
popular? Well, they can offer a lot of

464
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,600
agedefying beauty benefits to treat some

465
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,360
of those wrinkles that we're so upset

466
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,120
about. And a lot of patients who come in

467
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,120
to see me really want to avoid

468
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,720
injectables if they can or delay them.

469
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,240
And of course, any in-office treatment I

470
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,920
do, I want it to last as long as

471
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,519
possible. So, these non-invasive

472
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,079
solutions that are still backed by

473
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,240
science are a great option. So, there's

474
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,519
a brand new non-invasive product. It's

475
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,600
on the market right now that had you

476
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,199
very excited, right? It's from Number

477
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,720
Seven Laboratories and it's called

478
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,639
Number Seven Laboratories Line

479
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,399
Correcting Booster Serum. And it's

480
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,720
clinically proven to help you look up to

481
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,639
5 years younger in 12 weeks. And in

482
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,839
fact, when it first launched in the UK,

483
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,519
they had a 17,000 person weight list.

484
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,839
And it's beauty brand number seven's

485
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,760
most concentrated agedefying serum. And

486
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,839
it's clinically designed to be applied

487
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,919
right over those deeper wrinkles that

488
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,760
most women are bothered by. And it

489
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,240
rivals professional grade results. In

490
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,480
fact, 76% of women who were considering

491
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,039
Injectables said they could now wait.

492
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,520
They can wait. You can do it at home.

493
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,600
That's right. Let's step in to your

494
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,880
wrinkles. Write into them and take a

495
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,199
closer look at how number seven

496
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,360
scientists believe their line correcting

497
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,520
booster serum works. So, here we are in

498
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,160
the skin. And if you don't mind, let's

499
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,559
just orient people. I'm the before and

500
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,080
you're 12 weeks after application. I

501
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,360
like being the after. Yes. Well, let's

502
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,280
see how the before is doing. So, first

503
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,880
of all, I'll point something out on my

504
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,400
side. I've got wrinkles so deep I could

505
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,160
twist my ankle in them. See how deep

506
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,840
these wrinkles are? And what's going on

507
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,679
after 12 weeks of number seven? Well,

508
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,679
you can barely see the wrinkles here.

509
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,840
They're much softer and much finer

510
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,840
looking. And that's really powerful.

511
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,200
It's like glass water over on your side.

512
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,559
That's right. Got the Sahara Desert

513
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,760
here. All right. But let's go a little

514
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,360
deeper because we're both physicians.

515
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,679
That's right. Let's look under the skin

516
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,760
to what might be going on. And here, if

517
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,679
you look at my side, the darkness is the

518
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,000
scaffolding. So, I'll get down and I'll

519
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,280
look and up here, I don't have a lot of

520
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,960
scaffolding. That I guess it's

521
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,559
fibrillin. Fibbrillain. Yeah. I don't

522
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,240
have much on my side, but after 12 weeks

523
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,240
on your side. That's right. You can see

524
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,799
that the fibbrillain is restored. And

525
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,720
this is all thanks to number seven's key

526
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,960
ingredient, which is matricxel 3000

527
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,640
plus, which helps with fibrillin repair.

528
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,640
And that fibbrillin repair is that

529
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,480
scaffolding is now restored and it's

530
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,240
back. And that's what helps plump up the

531
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,720
skin and make those li wrinkles look

532
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
much softer and finer. All right, so

533
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,240
we're going to try to see if this line

534
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,919
correcting booster works in action.

535
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,960
Michelle and Jen are both here. We both

536
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,039
gave them correcting booster serums to

537
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,120
try. They've been using for 3 weeks. So

538
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,720
Jen, before we get to your after, what

539
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,400
was bothering you about your skin the

540
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
most before you started? Well, I'm not

541
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,720
quite 40 yet, so it really annoyed me

542
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
that I have the not the 11, but the

543
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,760
other way. I have the horizontal

544
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,000
forehead lines and every picture that's

545
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,400
all I could see is those lines. So, I

546
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,880
was constantly editing out my forehead

547
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,960
lines and I'm a realtor so my head shot

548
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,840
I accidentally edited off half of my

549
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,039
eyebrow the first time. Oh no. So, um I

550
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,080
thought this is ridiculous. That's

551
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,520
actually a tellt tell sign if you're

552
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,280
using some of those software packages

553
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,360
instead of actually looking that way.

554
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
It's a call to action. So, show us how

555
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,880
number seven line correcting booster

556
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,280
serum works. Dr. Day. Yeah. So the first

557
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,760
thing you do is you wash your face and

558
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,559
pat your skin dry and then you apply the

559
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,640
line correcting booster serum right on

560
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,240
top of those deeper wrinkles. So in her

561
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,760
we do it right across her forehead,

562
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,919
right across those deeper wrinkles that

563
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,280
are bothering her the most. And after 12

564
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,039
weeks you'll see that those lines start

565
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,880
to soften. But I would start out by

566
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,480
saying that she's quite beautiful. She

567
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,960
has gorgeous cheekbones and beautiful

568
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,720
eyes. And we want these lines to not be

569
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,720
what distracts her from seeing her own

570
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,840
beauty. So applying it right over those

571
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,039
wrinkles. It's not a whole face

572
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,320
treatment. It's really designed for

573
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,000
those deeper wrinkles that bother you

574
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,919
the most. How How does it feel now you

575
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,679
haven't used it for a few weeks? To be

576
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,840
honest, I was a little weary of

577
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,160
something that was going to make a

578
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,440
difference in that amount of time and I

579
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,880
was so pleasantly surprised that I went

580
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,600
out and bought a couple more number

581
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:16,559
seven products and um it doesn't feel

582
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,520
tight or flaky, which some of those do.

583
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:22,240
It just feels very light and airy and

584
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,080
put my makeup on. her regular uh serum

585
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,360
and moisturizer right on top. And in the

586
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,520
daytime, of course, she's going to apply

587
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
her sunscreen every day, all year round.

588
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,320
And you've been using it for three weeks

589
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,320
as well. How did it work for you? It

590
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,600
worked wonderful. I'm a little north of

591
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,640
the 50. I'm not quite 40 anymore. So, I

592
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,840
noticed a lot in my forehead and the the

593
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,840
11s. It was my issue. And I did notice a

594
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,679
lot of softening in that small amount of

595
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,520
time. So, I definitely will be using the

596
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,360
product more. I can see a big difference

597
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,919
in you. I love that. Yeah. Yeah. The

598
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,520
before was kind of frightening. No, but

599
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,880
you're happy now. I'm very happy with

600
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,559
it. Good for you. I'm very happy for

601
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
both of you. Dr. D, break it down for

make for dinner tonight. Singing is my

619
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,120
first love, but my other passion is

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,679
baking.

621
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,280
I'm an iron chef, but mostly the

622
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,280
executive chef of Butter Restaurant and

623
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,880
mother to an 11-year-old. This is the

624
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,080
first recipe I ever made in a

625
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,320
professional kitchen. They were

626
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,559
terrible. My cooking is like me. A mix

627
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,200
of Caribbean heat meet southern sweet.

628
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,120
This is like my girlfriend in the

629
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,919
kitchen. I am as a chef first and

630
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,840
foremost about flavor. It's simple. It's

631
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,679
celebratory. And most of all, it's about

632
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,260
having a great time in the kitchen. What

633
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:11,840
is going I'm trying to help. Let's dish.

634
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:15,840

Yes. So much champagne is already

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,799
which one holds up to the ultimate

662
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,200
Italian cheesy pasta. I love

663
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,880
competitions. I know, Jenny. Hello. So

664
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,280
nice to be here. Look at me sandwich

665
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,520
between all you lovely people. I mean,

666
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,840
doctor, how lucky are we? The luckiest.

667
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,840
Absolut. And that's toast the pasta back

668
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,039
on the menu.

669
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,880
J, you're a pasta fanatic. That you're

670
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,720
such a fanatic. You one up Jamie. You

671
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,559
take selfies everywhere you go. I mean,

672
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,159
pasta is so indulgent for me. So, I just

673
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,440
kind of do it every now and again, but I

674
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,880
take selfies with them because it's kind

675
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,240
of like taking a picture with with your

676
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,080
boo, your bae. You know what I'm saying?

677
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,240
It's like, "Hey, pasta, I love you. I

678
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,760
like you." So, yes, I'm not the only one

679
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,679
that takes pictures with my boo. Now,

680
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,120
here's my question. Do you then go back

681
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,880
through your camera roll like late at

682
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,720
night and take a look at your pasta porn

683
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,159
and just like relive the moment? It's

684
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,840
kind of a fetish. I do have a moment

685
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,600
like, "Oh, wow. always happen to you

686
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,039
Americans.

687
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,880
Not in England. Not in England. No, no,

688
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,280
we don't have pasta porn in England. We

689
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,080
just we just eat pasta and we enjoy it.

690
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,600
Came here. Well, listen. Look, pasta is

691
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,559
a beautiful thing. It's a fantastic

692
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,320
carrier of flavors. And this one, guys,

693
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,279
this is the craziest, most delicious

694
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,320
thing ever. Can I start, please? Okay.

695
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,679
So, look, if we've got Cavalon Nero

696
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,000
here. This is the black the black

697
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,000
cabbage, but any green leaf, kale,

698
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,080
seavoy cabbage. We've got Swiss chard

699
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,159
here, spinach. Right, go with me on this

700
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,159
one, guys. Um, now we're going to we're

701
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,760
going to prep the stalks off of our

702
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,840
greens. And you can use, like I said,

703
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,559
any greens you want. And then we will

704
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,960
blanch these greens. Um, and that means

705
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,760
sort of cook it for like 3 or 4 minutes.

706
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,679
And what we'll do is we'll take greens

707
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,279
like this, right, which are nice and

708
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,120
hot. Um, and these are just been

709
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,720
blanched because we're doing it on TV,

710
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,880
right? And we'll simply put it in a

711
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,720
liquidizer with a bit of cooking water.

712
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,240
Easy, right? Anyone can do that. Then

713
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,919
get me the garlic in there as well.

714
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,760
Easy, right? Chef. And then we're going

715
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,440
to balance with a little Parmesan or

716
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,120
Parmesan as we call it. Love that. A

717
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,480
little umami. All right. Then um then

718
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,200
we're going to go in with some olive

719
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,279
oil. Now olive oil, as all of you clever

720
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,760
people here will know, is a fantastic

721
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,000
hearthealthy oil. uh the polyphenols

722
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,240
which are the antioxidants you know the

723
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
these are these are doctor tell me these

724
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,240
are things that kind of attack free

725
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,600
radicals right anti-inflammatory you

726
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,440
need it to for your cells to function

727
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,640
normally and you mentioned genevese

728
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,000
earlier Italians eat pasta like this and

729
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,440
they don't gain weight so obviously

730
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,360
there's a way of doing this so we don't

731
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,880
suffer and the other thing is guys is we

732
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,400
don't in Italy they don't have main

733
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,240
course portions of pasta it doesn't

734
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,159
exist they're all starter size they're

735
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,320
all small so whatever you have good or

736
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,159
bad in life portion control is an issue

737
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,159
Wind it up, baby. Wind it up. Would

738
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,559
either. So, yes. Now, um we were talking

739
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,559
about five ingredients. Yes. Um my

740
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,240
latest book is um Quick and Easy

741
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,080
Fiveingredient Ingredient Food. Excuse

742
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,360
me. I've got the pasta going in. Uh

743
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,159
normally this will be in from the start,

744
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,080
but we're cheating cuz it's TV. Um so,

745
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,200
um what we have guys here is we'll end

746
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,240
up with this. I don't know if the camera

747
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,799
can show you this, but basically we've

748
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,360
liquidized the greens. Can

749
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,760
I? It's just greens, garlic, oil,

750
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,600
parmesan, and then we'll toss it with

751
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,760
the pasta. And we'll just coat it. And

752
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,799
more cheese. Well, we might taste it and

753
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,039
see. But let's have a little look. Alex,

754
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,039
what a sick fence you are. A little

755
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,240
cheese, please. A little cheese. So,

756
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,919
look. Look at the color. Guys, wait. Let

757
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,760
my dad try that. I want to try my

758
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,760
dad. Have a

759
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,760
little

760
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:35,039
medical in school. t-shirt. Oh, and

761
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,799
you'll notice I I dress like the doctor

762
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,559
today, so I came in a white outfit just

763
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,080
so you know. So, we're going to we're

764
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,679
going to taste this now and balance it.

765
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,240
Now, also for look for this is ricotta.

766
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,400
Have a look for it. This is This is It

767
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,480
means ricotta means recooked. It's a

768
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,600
really good lowfat cheese which is

769
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,440
supposed to be low fat. You don't want

770
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,240
to put too much cheese. Absolutely. Are

771
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,720
you ricott?

772
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,080
She she just keeps going. Look, it's

773
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,360
kale. Dr. Oz, look.

774
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,240
you. But I swear just just have a look

775
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,440
at this is the most extraordinary pasta.

776
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,880
But what happened to the ricotta here?

777
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,240
What happened to this? Well, you are

778
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,840
going to erotically put it pasta. You

779
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000
are going to erotically put it over the

780
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,919
top of this pasta. Don't be cheap. Don't

781
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,760
be cheap. Get your camera ready, Jimmy.

782
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,080
Get your camera ready. That's enough. I

783
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,080
know what you're thinking.

784
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,440
Let's use our

785
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,559
hand. Okay, that's she's she's got it.

786
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,880
So, what we have here is a beautiful

787
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,320
kale green pasta. It is delicious. You

788
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,000
have to try it to believe it. It's five

789
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,600
ingredients. Have a try. Please enjoy.

790
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,799
Take us over here. Oh, that's enough

791
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,080
cheese. Come on. Come on. Come over

792
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,919
here. Jamie, come over here. You keep

793
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,760
moving the target. What the [ __ ]

794
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,279
Cheese.

795
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,480
Well, why? You got to start tasting

796
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,919
that. I got to say Daffhne is in the

797
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,320
midst of trying to get her kids, my

798
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,200
grandkids to eat green foods. I'm going

799
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,039
to show you what happened when my

800
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
grandkids were first exposed to this

801
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,880
pesto pasta. This is Yeah, I I witnessed

802
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,960
this from behind the scenes. This is

803
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,320
Dy's version of green spaghetti. Take a

804
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,679
look. John Boy, can you taste it? No. I

805
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,960
would like you just to have one bite and

806
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,960
tell me what you think of that green

807
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:19,200
monster pasta. It It's gooey. It's not

808
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,720
good for kids. Sorry if you No, it's

809
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,399
definitely good for kids, guys. I used

810
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,399
to love this when I was your age. It's

811
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,480
Mommy made it. It's super delicious. It

812
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,440
tastes it tastes even better with salt

813
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,799
on one. One saw one says it's not good

814
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,399
for kids. You were passionate about

815
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,840
children and healthy foods. Why does

816
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,679
this message work for you? Well, the

817
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,360
thing is this actual recipe is not a

818
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,120
trendy new thing. This is like hundreds

819
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,120
of years in Tuscanyany, right? Hundreds

820
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,039
of years. Um I've gone to Italy in the

821
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,720
mountains and I've seen armies of kids

822
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,240
eat stuff like this and you go, "Really?

823
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Really? British kids, American kids?

824
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Really?" Yeah. Because it's normal. My

825
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,520
kids used to eat this like a dream. I

826
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,000
would make pesto all the time and now

827
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,279
they're four and they're a green.

828
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,120
Do do you think there should be some

829
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,919
life balance though? I mean, like we go

830
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,799
to a market, we see the peaches of

831
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,399
Tuscany, you know, that are the best

832
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,000
ever, and then we go to like a pastry

833
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,120
market and see all the cakes. Do you

834
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,880
think there should be some balance?

835
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,200
Here's the thing. I I think I think I I

836
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,600
think a fair and good life is about

837
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,520
choice. I mean, I'm a food lover, so I

838
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,760
love cake. I love burger. I love pizza.

839
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,399
But like, it's it's your stomach doesn't

840
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,640
see food. It's it sees molecules and

841
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,039
nutrients, right? My stomach's like a

842
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,159
six-pack ab of eyes.

843
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,320
No, I see everything. So, I'm hydra. I

844
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,320
admire so much of what you do and in

845
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,320
particularly your gift for creating

846
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,039
books. Five ingredients. This wonderful

847
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,559
book makes sense for adults, their kids

848
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,919
and everyone in between whether you know

849
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,080
a lot or not. Explain a little bit about

850
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,840
the principle. So, uh it it took 20

851
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
years I'm a slow learner to work out

852
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,039
that it's actually the length of

853
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,880
ingredients that is one of the first

854
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,039
kind of edits of people cooking or not

855
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,640
cooking. And then the second one is have

856
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,080
I got the ingredients? So, if you flick

857
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,760
through that book, you've probably got

858
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,039
three ingredients in your house already,

859
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,960
and then you've only got to pick up one

860
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,440
or two things on the way home from work.

861
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,200
So, combinations that just want to work.

862
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,559
Well, this dish is in the book, and I'm

863
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,159
obsessed with it. I see why you have

864
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,760
five kids. Your wife is a lucky woman.

865
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,640
You are a phenomenal chef, and I'm going

866
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,880
to keep eating this like many. So, Jamie

867
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,279
Jamie brought two books. You all get one

868
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,440
page of this beautiful book. Is that

869
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,559
right? No. No. Everyone here has got a

870
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,799
copy of my book today. Woo! It's called

871
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,039
Five Ingredients with Hast on the cover.

872
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,880
Up next, a delicious dish made with a

873
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,880
simple hack that lowers the carb load of

874
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,080
literally any starchy food. Stick

875
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,080
around. Oh, that looks good.

876
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,799
The pasta party is still happening right

877
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,320
here in the dish. Come back because Alex

878
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,159
has a chilled pasta dish that'll have

879
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,679
everyone reaching for seconds. I can't

880
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,950
wait to taste it. I'll be the judge of

881
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,670
that, Tanya.

882
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:50,360
[Music]

883
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,320
[Applause]

884
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,799
[Music]

885
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,080
Flavor and great tasting food is a way

886
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,399
to truly enjoy life. I'm an only child

887
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,120
product of two Italian parents who both

888
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,840
love to cook. My mom was a cookbook

889
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,080
editor who presided over some of the

890
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,279
great cookbooks. I think that was the

891
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,399
beginning. I'm an Iron Chef, a judge on

892
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,919
Food Networks Chopped, but I am mostly

893
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,080
the executive chef of Butter Restaurant

894
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,159
in Midtown Manhattan, and mother to an

895
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,840
11-year-old. Welcome to my kitchen at

896
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,440
Butter. This is the first recipe I ever

897
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,440
made in a professional kitchen, but they

898
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,840
were terrible. I'm not going to lie.

899
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,080
Some days are work, but I love what I

900
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,760
do. It's like putting on a Broadway play

901
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,760
every night. I never get tired of it.

902
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,919
We are back with a dish on Oz. Jamie

903
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,399
Oliver is here hanging out with us in

904
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,159
the kitchen and it is a total

905
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,679
celebration today. We are having a pasta

906
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,440
party because you do not have to be

907
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,960
afraid of pasta anymore. We're giving

908
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,120
you the tips and tricks to enjoy

909
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,039
everyone's favorite carb. And dad, I

910
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,039
understand you've got another cool

911
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,559
guilt-free hack to eat pasta. Tell us

912
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,159
about it. Pardon the punch. We'll be

913
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,519
here all week. By the way, all week I

914
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,200
get my Here's the thing. It is cool

915
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,640
because it's about cold pasta. I don't

916
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,559
know if you talk about this much in the

917
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,000
UK, but it's become a big issue. As I've

918
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,080
looked at it, it makes sense. Cooling

919
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,600
carbs like pasta after cooking them

920
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,919
increases resistant starch. Remember,

921
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,120
pasta is basically sugar and fiber. It

922
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,880
could be one or the other. If you make

923
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,559
it more like fiber, it's much better for

924
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,600
you. That's what cooling it does. Means

925
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,519
you don't get much of a blood sugar

926
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,440
response. And it's perfect for folks on

927
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,880
the January no diet diet that we

928
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,559
featured on the show last week cuz we're

929
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,120
waving the white flag and we're eating

930
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,600
pasta again. Eat it. Eat it. Good. And

931
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,799
the problem the problem with me saying

932
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,399
this is everyone looks out there and

933
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,279
says, "Okay, what's a cold carb?" It's

934
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,279
potato salad. Yeah. Until today, cuz we

935
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,320
got the dish. And Jamie, telling you the

936
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,000
truth, chilled Chinese noodles. Alex is

937
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,919
going to bring this alive for us. Oh,

938
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,480
he's excited. I mean, Alex, bring Take a

939
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,440
look. She made it for us. Oh, you're

940
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,159
going to like it. One of my favorite old

941
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,399
school recipes from my dad. These tangy

942
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,600
cool noodles. Sesame noodles. I'm going

943
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,720
to start by adding the soy sauce, which

944
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,720
is really the heart of the

945
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:11,120
recipe. Get that sugar and salt

946
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,640
dissolving in there. The sesame oil in

947
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,360
there, and that's going to coat these

948
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,799
noodles really beautifully. So, just two

949
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,880
teaspoons of hot sauce. And that's a

950
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,000
lot. Love that. So, here's the

951
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,640
foundation of the sauce. We're going to

952
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,760
pop that in the fridge. And while that's

953
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,320
cooling, we are going to take these

954
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,720
noodles and drop them right into boiling

955
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,720
salted

956
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,360
water. Time to

957
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,840
drain. Shake those noodles. This is what

958
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,720
my dad taught me. And now we're going to

959
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,960
fill the pot we cooked it in with cold

960
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:56,679
water and actually drop those hot

961
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,679
noodles in the cold water.

962
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:07,410
[Music]

963
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:15,200
[Music]

964
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,560
Yum. Alice is very stingy with my

965
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,240
portion, I should say. First, first, why

966
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,159
did you use a towel? I can count the

967
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,000
numbers of strains of pasta here. Why'd

968
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,280
you use a towel to dry the pasta? Well,

969
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,200
we don't think about it when we drain

970
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,520
pasta cuz we talk romantically about

971
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,119
using water to make the sauce, but when

972
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,639
you're not, you want pure flavor. Get

973
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,639
that water out of there. Drain your

974
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,399
pasta, turn it on a kitchen towel, and

975
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,320
pat it dry. Like you dry off when you

976
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,000
get out of the pool, you want to dry

977
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,599
your pasta off and then add that flavor.

978
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,839
I never dry off. No, I don't either. I

979
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,679
let the water dry. I just thought it

980
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,200
exactly. Yeah. So, what what do you

981
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,440
think about Alex's concoction?

982
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,280
Delicious. Oh, please don't patronize

983
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,040
her. Well, why would I? It's beautifully

984
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,639
It's beautifully seasoned. You know,

985
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,800
there's nice ingredients in there. And

986
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,480
thank you. I'm glad to have someone on

987
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,079
my team. I think it's spectacular. And

988
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm even more impressed because I like

989
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,839
you are a worldrenowned Italian chef.

990
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,680
But I I don't Where did this inspiration

991
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,280
come from? Well, my father cooked

992
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,640
Chinese food for a hobby. And my dad

993
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,920
would make these elaborate Chinese

994
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,680
dinners. They would take three days to

995
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,800
prepare. Get I would go into the kitchen

996
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,000
to get something and my mother would

997
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,599
say, "Don't go in there till Friday."

998
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,200
Why would it not? Why would an Italian

999
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,960
guy be making Chinese food? He just

1000
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,880
thought the food of China was the one of

1001
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,920
the great cuisines of the world and that

1002
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,000
the Chinese Yeah. and that the Chinese

1003
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,280
taught the Italians to make pasta and so

1004
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,280
Goshell's think it all began in China.

1005
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,000
And so we end up with these um

1006
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,079
heart-healthy, carb friendly, wave the

1007
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,520
white flag. My problem is it may be

1008
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,200
chilled and better for me, but I'm going

1009
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,359
to eat double. Mhm.

1010
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
No, you're a dim sum favorite. I know

1011
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,280
you already. I know what you really eat.

1012
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,040
I do. This is that nice spiciness, not

1013
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,560
much. It's got a brightness with all the

1014
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,839
herbs. I think you all to try this. And

1015
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,520
I think this is an example how cold

1016
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,839
pasta can be even better than hot pasta.

1017
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,560
No, this is fantastic. I am feeling chai

1018
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,400
Italian, Alex, right now.

1019
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,240
I'm feeling that is like the best

1020
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,680
fusion. I love that comfort food all the

1021
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,320
way. So good. I kind of wonder if anyone

1022
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,320
else wants a taste.

1023
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,000
What did that mean? Who is that?

1024
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:23,240
[Applause]

1025
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Michael first.

1026
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,320
Hi, sweetie.

1027
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,079
Word on the street is I'm going to try

1028
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,599
some noodles. Come join us. Come join.

1029
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,359
Come join the party. Oh, nice to have

1030
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,160
you. You know you know you know Jamie.

1031
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,880
Nice to meet you. Hi, sweetie. Yes,

1032
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,040
sweetie. Sweetie, you can't ruin my rep

1033
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,560
by saying things like sweetie, right?

1034
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,160
That's what we we want to know all that

1035
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,200
stuff. What's like the cutesy word you

1036
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,560
call each other at home? Um, a few, but

1037
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,000
Pooh Bear is the one that sticks out.

1038
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,240
Poo Bear. Alex is Poo Bear. Oh my gosh.

1039
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Wait a minute. Okay, I got to get the

1040
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,680
dish on you, too. Okay, so and I'm that

1041
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,520
friend that grills all the boyfriends.

1042
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,920
So, okay. So, Michael, how are you? Nice

1043
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,079
to meet you. Where you from? Um, what do

1044
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,320
you cook? What does Alex like it spicy

1045
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,599
or sweet in the kitchen? And what's your

1046
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,040
intentions? You want to put a ring on

1047
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,400
it? Like I have so many questions. Like

1048
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,320
I don't know where you can eat while we

1049
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,480
do this. Tell me everything about you.

1050
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Do you want to leave? No, no, no. Don't

1051
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,400
leave. Don't leave. Come. Grill master

1052
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,720
over here. That is me. I am that friend.

1053
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,960
I'm so sorry. Um I was a chef in a

1054
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,800
restaurant. I made something amazing and

1055
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,119
she wanted to meet the chef. I came out

1056
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,160
and um

1057
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,760
Oh my gosh. You were at the restaurant.

1058
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,520
You ate a meal of his. You demanded to

1059
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,040
meet the chef. It was that good. And he

1060
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,560
was back there in front of the stove and

1061
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,480
I said, "I'll take that to go."

1062
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,680
[Applause]

1063
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,119
I'll take two Bear to go. There you go.

1064
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,960
All right, Jamie. Nice to meet you.

1065
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,079
Yeah. No, not yet. We can't let him go.

1066
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,440
Me and the doctor are going to give him

1067
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,640
a full medical now. I hope you don't

1068
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,760
mind. Curt, please. Listen, Jamie, I

1069
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,160
adore you. Thank you for coming,

1070
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,240
Michael. Pleasure. Lots more questions

1071
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,280

1072
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,880

1073
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,720

noodles to the test to see which one is

1075
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,710
the tastiest. You will not want to miss

1092
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,880
We are back with the dish on us. And all

1093
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,240
sure long we've been giving you hacks to

1094
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,800
take the guilt out of your favorite

1095
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,640
pasta dishes. Now our final hack,

1096
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,280
swapping in low carb noodles. From

1097
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,680
zoodles to lentil pasta and even the new

1098
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,440
kid on the block, quinoa macaroni.

1099
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,119
They're the ultimate. But can they

1100
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,960
deliver on flavor as much as the classic

1101
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,839
white pastas? Dapne has figured out a

1102
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,400
way to identify what makes sense. And

1103
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,920
your little trick is Well, I don't have

1104
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,000
a trick. I'm just going to have you guys

1105
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,359
do a noodle off. I want to make you I'm

1106
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,359
going to put you all on the spot and you

1107
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,640
tell me which of these pastas stacks up

1108
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,599
to the real thing. Okay, here's how it

1109
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,160
goes. The ultimate pasta in my book. My

1110
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,280
personal favorite is

1111
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,280
gacha, which is a fancy way of saying

1112
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,040
cheese and pepper. It's really like the

1113
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,200
simplest, easiest. You definitely have

1114
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,119
it in your in your pantry tonight. And

1115
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,560
it's just oh, it's so indulgent and

1116
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,480
amazing. And you can make it on linguini

1117
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,480
or another kind of pasta like that. But

1118
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,920
there are so many new noodles on the

1119
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,440
market and I kind of wanted to put them

1120
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,560
together. Okay. So, what you guys have

1121
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,160
in front of you is four different

1122
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,960
samples of pasta, all with that kaca

1123
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,920
pepe sauce. So, you have a lentil pasta,

1124
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,920
you have a um quinoa pasta, you have a

1125
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,119
zucchini pasta, and then you have your

1126
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,359
traditional ingredient. And I want to

1127
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,520
hear from you guys definitively. Make a

1128
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,880
choice. Which ones holds up to the

1129
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,240
original? Let me go first. I don't know

1130
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,240
the words that you will use to describe

1131
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,560
yours. I'm into the zoodles. Really?

1132
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,160
Yeah. This thing really is fantastic. It

1133
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,920
doesn't taste like zucchini. It tastes

1134
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,920
like it's supposed to taste like a

1135
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,839
zoodle. I mean, all right, Alex, what do

1136
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,119
you got? Well, I'm gonna jump in because

1137
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,480
I'm following your lead. I think the

1138
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,800
zoodles are my favorite. I mean, they're

1139
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,720
all cheesy and spicy, which is great,

1140
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,839
but I like the crunch in the bite on the

1141
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,280
zucchini. It gives me a little more

1142
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,960
bite. I like it. I like it. Me and you.

1143
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,960
How about you guys? You know what? I

1144
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,520
love a zoodle. It's a little bit on the

1145
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,280
fresh freshly mowed lawn side of things

1146
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:45,200
for me. I need to see classic spaghetti

1147
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,760
visually. So, for me, I'm going to go

1148
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,160
with the quinoa. I really like the bite

1149
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,560
and the chew. I like that. I might break

1150
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,200
up with you, chew to the pasta. I need

1151
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,000
it. I can't just delicately eat zucchini

1152
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,880
on the way back from the gym and feel

1153
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,800
right. Do you know?

1154
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,800
I love that. I love I love that. I need

1155
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,000
backup, Daffy. I I got You know, I I

1156
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,520
want to side with you. I feel like

1157
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,839
quinoa was the way that I was going and

1158
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,520
I was so not about to go for the

1159
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,440
zucchini, but I'm going to go team

1160
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,280
zucchini. There is something really

1161
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,800
light and refreshing and delicious.

1162
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,920
All right, you had a game for us. Yes, I

1163
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,359
have a fun game cuz you know I love a

1164
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,599
good party game. So, you know that

1165
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,040
zoodles are made of zucchini, but let's

1166
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,359
see if you can guess what these other

1167
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,880
voodles are made of. So, ve vegetable

1168
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,319
noodles. Got it. Voodles. All right. So,

1169
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,680
coodles. What would that audience? That

1170
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,800
sounds like something these two are

1171
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,480
doing after.

1172
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,880
What would that be? Name the vegetable.

1173
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,200
Cucumber. Carrots. Carrots. Yes. Oh,

that's a good guess. Parsnips.

1184
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:18,160
That's hard. That's hard. That's tough.

1185
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,240
One more. And toodles. Toodles. Toodles.
