1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,400
Who could ever forget the sudden and

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,640
untimely death of Hollywood actress

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,040
Natalie Wood? The starlet's body was

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,040
found floating in the Pacific Ocean

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,120
hours after a leisurely night on her

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,360
yacht with her husband Robert Wagner and

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,560
co-star Christopher Walkin. It was

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,439
considered a tragic accident.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,880
Last year, Robert Wagner was officially

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,439
named a person of interest, but to this

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,439
day, it has never really been clear what

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,519
happened that night. and it will reign

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,239
as one of the darkest unsolved Hollywood

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,480
mysteries of all time. Today, Nancy

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,559
Grace is here to take a new look at the

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,960
evidence. We're asking the question,

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,559
what does Natalie Wood's autopsy report

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,120
reveal about how she really died?

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,680
With do-y innocence that evolved into

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,000
smoldering sensuality, actress Natalie

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,800
Wood made the leap from child star to

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,520
Anjenu and leading lady to international

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,160
icon with ease. Her tremendous talent

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,800
and beauty made her a superstar. Her

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,519
love life made her a tabloid staple.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,920
Married, divorced, and remarried to

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,680
actor Robert Wagner, the telegenic

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
couple became one of Hollywood's most

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,240
tumultuous duos, ending with Natalie's

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,320
untimely and tragic death in 1981. Her

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,799
last night alive was spent with Wagner

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,520
on their yacht with their guest, actor

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,680
Christopher Walan. After an evening of

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,000
drinking and alleged quarreling,

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,560
Natalie, who was unable to swim and

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,560
terrified of deep water, somehow went

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,680
overboard,

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,880
6 hours later, her body, floating face

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,400
down, was recovered a mile away. She was

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,400
43 years old. Her last moments on the

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,119
yacht fueled rampid speculation and

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,360
innuendo. The Los Angeles County

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,920
Coroner's autopsy would deem her death

44
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,720
an accidental drowning, but note that

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,280
her body was covered with bruises. The

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,600
yacht's captain, Dennis Deiver, also

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,159
reported hearing Wagner and Wood loudly

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,719
quarreling before her death. No charges

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,920
were ever filed, but the case was

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,239
reopened in 2011, and Wood's death was

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,200
reclassified to drowning and other

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,000
undetermined factors. And just last

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,959
year, Robert Wagner was named a person

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,280
of interest by investigators.

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,599
Now, more than three decades later, will

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,440
there finally be answers about Natalie

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,760
Wood's untimely and tragic death?

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,440
Join me now is Crime Online founder and

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,120
former prosecutor Nancy Grace. Thank you

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
as always for being here. Now, there

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,800
were three people there, only three, the

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,280
night that Natalie Wood drowned. The

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,760
captain, Dennis Dabvern, was Christopher

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,800
Walkin and Natalie's husband, Robert

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,800
Wagner. Now, their stories differ.

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
You've interviewed Natalie's captain,

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
Dennis Daburn. How is his story

68
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,720
different from what Christopher Walkin

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,280
has said in the past and Robert Wagner

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,280
as well? Well, can I tell you this, Dr.

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,879
Ros? I have questioned and put on the

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,599
stand and cross-examined well over a

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,519
thousand people and that's being on the

74
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,959
low side. I think I know a liar. I'm

75
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,519
sure you do. Dennis Diver

76
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,400
is not lying. Now, I know he lied at the

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,480
get-go, but according to him, Robert

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,319
Wagner said, "Stick to my story." And he

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,920
and Walkin did. Now, Natalie Wood and

80
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,480
Walkin, Christopher Walkin, were

81
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,560
starring in a new movie, Brainstorm.

82
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,920
Okay. They were scientists that married

83
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,640
each other. And Wagner was very jealous.

84
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,120
And he admits that. Mhm. All right. So,

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,400
the night before all this happens, it's

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,239
so bad that Natalie asked Diver, the

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
captain, to take her ashore. And they

88
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,680
slept in a hotel, separate rooms, the

89
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,319
night before. She was so upset with

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,920
Wagner being jealous of her. So they go

91
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,080
back, they have a nice breakfast, she

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,120
cooks it, blah blah. It's like nothing

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,120
ever went wrong. That night, Wagner,

94
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,319
which he didn't tell us at first. He

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
said at first it was because of the

96
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,239
motion of the boat. Then he comes out

97
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,560
and it's in his book. He takes a wine

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,720
bottle. They were all drinking too much.

99
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,720
You know, too much booze gets you in

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,359
trouble. He gets the wine bottle,

101
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,040
crashes it down on the table with

102
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,759
Natalie Wood and Christopher Walking

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,080
sitting there. I mean, can you imagine

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
your husband doing that? Well, Walking

105
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,080
got up right then and he went to his

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
room and shut the door and that's what

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,479
everybody says happened. So, Walkin

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,040
stayed in his room. So, I believe

109
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,120
Walkin. He doesn't have anything to add.

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:45,120
After that, Diver tells me that he heard

111
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,440
loud arguing, physical arguing, like

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,120
motion. Then suddenly everything goes

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,759
quiet.

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,000
He gets up and goes to the aft deck.

115
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,120
Wagner, he says, is leaned back against

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,360
the wall, says, "Natalie's gone. You

117
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,759
better look for her."

118
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,000
He runs around, looks, can't find her.

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,440
This is what Diver tells me. And then he

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,280
says, "We got to turn on the spotlight.

121
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,880
The dingy's gone." This is Devurn

122
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,600
talking. And he goes, "No, I don't want

123
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,039
any bad press. I just let's wait. They

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,240
don't turn on the spotlight." So, long

125
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,639
story short, the story is she went, got

126
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,120
mad, and went out on the dinghy. So,

127
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,039
some of this became evident years ago,

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,199
and I understand the very beginning none

129
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,639
of it was really clear, and they've

130
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
slowly been putting pieces together. So

131
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,680
what happened after 20 years that

132
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,520
prompted the police to reopen the case

133
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,280
of Natalie? Additional witnesses, two

134
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:48,320
witnesses on two separate v vessels, two

135
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:51,039
boats, separated, they're not together,

136
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,720
claim they hear a male and a female

137
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,919
voice that they say they believe is

138
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,120
Wagner and Natalie. Mhm. They say they

139
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,600
hear them fighting outside on the deck,

140
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,600
which is completely

141
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,080
opposite of what Wagner says happened

142
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,479
that night. So, what stuns me still is

143
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,080
that decades after the original event,

144
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,600
just now, we're beginning to put these

145
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,600
pieces together. How how common is that,

146
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,080
for example, for these witnesses to

147
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,479
suddenly come out who I suspect, you

148
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,759
know, they must have known or sus or

149
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,919
been aware that they could have been

150
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,479
helpful back in 1981. you're not going

151
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,440
to like this. But there are almost

152
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,400
always witnesses that the state doesn't

153
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,440
find. Not because they're not trying. I

154
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,840
mean, at that time, uh, he's a

155
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,319
superstar. She's, "Oh, listen to this.

156
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,400
This is what a fan a relative told me

157
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,720
that relative of of Natalie that Wagner

158
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,440
would say. I'm just a TV like, where do

159
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,199
you guys want to go? Ask Natalie. She's

160
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,639
the movie star. I'm just the TV TV TV TV

161
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,639
guy now. Why would you say that? I mean,

162
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,120
it was clear that resentment. And they

163
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,039
were divorced. Oz, they were married,

164
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,280
they got divorced, she remarried

165
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,120
somebody else, had a baby, divorced, and

166
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,360
then they got back together. And I

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,560
always say this to ladies, there's a

168
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,520
reason he's an ex. Remember that when

169
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,599
you want to get back together.

170
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,520
All right, up next, the woman who fought

171
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,199
to get Natalie Wood's case reopened. She

172
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,599
is here in person. What evidence does

173
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,360
she say she has from Natalie's autopsy

174
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,639
that may change everything? Stay with

175
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,280
us. We're back investigating how actress

176
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,759
Natalie Wood met a tragic end after a

177
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
fatal voyage sent her overboard in the

178
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,800
Pacific Ocean. Now, her death was

179
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,199
labeled an accidental drowning in 1981,

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,319
but later changed to drowning and other

181
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,400
undetermined factors decades later.

182
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,560
Since then, Wood's death has continued

183
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,319
to spark controversy. I'm back with

184
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Nancy Grace. We're also joined by

185
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
investigative author Marty Roelly. She

186
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
has fought for decades to get Natalie

187
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,720
Wood's case reopened. Now, Marty is

188
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,879
close friends with Dennis Thaburn, the

189
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,120
boat captain, who was an eyewitness the

190
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,879
night Natalie Wood died. Thank you for

191
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800
being here. You're welcome. Thank you.

192
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,879
Before I get to the details of this,

193
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,120
what got you involved in this? What

194
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,639
launched your lifelong desire to figure

195
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,560
out what really happened to Natalie

196
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,960
Wood? Well, I was always a fan of

197
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,599
Natalie Woods ever since I was a kid.

198
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,520
But my friend Dennis Stiver worked for

199
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,000
them. And when I heard of Natalie's

200
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,360
death the day she was pulled from the

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,360
water, it was worldbreaking news. I

202
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,519
expected a call from Dennis. We were

203
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,760
that close. It took 18 months for him to

204
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,800
call me in the middle of the night and

205
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,479
confess there was foul play in Natalie's

206
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,279
death.

207
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,040
So, I want to put my doctor hat on for a

208
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,440
second and go through this autopsy. The

209
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,320
case was reopened. A new coroner was

210
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,399
assigned to re-examine Natalie's autopsy

211
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,320
report. So, let's go up here together.

212
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,360
I'm going to show everybody what this

213
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,760
autopsy report reveals. And initially,

214
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,360
remember Natalie's case, her her was

215
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
death was determined to be an accidental

216
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,560
drowning. But closer look at the bruises

217
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,800
all over her body tend to paint a very

218
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,000
different picture. So, I'll explain

219
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,839
this, but you guys should all be

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,399
thinking with me. What could have caused

221
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,560
this? So, she had bruising up on her

222
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,200
forehead and her cheek, right? She had

223
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,600
bruising on her right forearm. She had

224
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,600
some bruising on her left wrist, right?

225
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
The front of her right and her left legs

226
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,440
had bruising, right? That's what this

227
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,760
writing all says. And then she also had

228
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,040
bruising on her left knee and her right

229
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,640
ankle, right? Left knee and right ankle.

230
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,160
And now those bruises also involved the

231
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,640
back of her legs. There are quite a few

232
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,800
back here. In fact, my team counted all

233
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,160
these bruises. There are at least 11

234
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,360
bruises to the back of Nalie's legs and

235
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,120
at least 28 bruises to the front of her

236
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,800
body.

237
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Now, I'm trying to figure out how does

238
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,279
someone get bruises on their ankles and

239
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,800
their wrists, right? What causes that?

240
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,880
How do you get so many bruises on the

241
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,080
back of your legs? So, Marty, what could

242
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,000
this be? Well, when I received Natalie

243
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,480
Wood's autopsy report, the minute I saw

244
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,880
these diagrams, I knew I was looking at

245
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,440
a battered woman. I could not believe

246
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,480
that a coroner could have just let this

247
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,120
go for one fall. One fall can never

248
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,200
cause this many bruises. And objects

249
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,000
hitting you in the water, I highly doubt

250
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,640
it. But these bruises, I went over this

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
with a doctor. They look like Natalie

252
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,399
had been held at the ankles and dragged,

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,959
which could have caused the facial

254
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,040
abrasion. Her face was dragged along the

255
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,640
deck. So she's if she's face down Yes.

256
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,959
and the ankles are grabbed and she's

257
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,480
pulled along this non-stick deck. Yes.

258
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,560
That could explain some of these 28

259
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,519
bruises on the front. Many of them, but

260
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,440
especially the upward position facial

261
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,760
abrasion and the small circular bruises

262
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,440
at her ankles from holding the ankles.

263
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,920
Yes. Or or the wrists. And what about

264
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,160
the back of the leg? That could have

265
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,000
been from the fight in the state room

266
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
that Dennis was right above on the

267
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,480
bridge and he heard things hitting the

268
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,320
walls and banging and who knows what

269
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,399
kicking and punching went on in that

270
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,720
room. Now, there's one other item here

271
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,120
that I want to point out to y'all, which

272
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,519
was the bladder. This is a very

273
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,200
important detail. Natalie's bladder was

274
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,959
full

275
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,800
and this is important and it's crucial

276
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,320
issue for investigators to know about.

277
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,440
Let's put it in context. The average

278
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,120
human bladder 3 to 400 cc's, right?

279
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
Couple cups of of fluid. You all go to

280
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,959
the bathroom. You know how much urine is

281
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,880
in there, right? She had 300 cc's of

282
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,560
urine in her bladder during the autopsy,

283
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,120
which means her bladder is basically

284
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,600
full. Now, the theory was that Natalie

285
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,279
was fearfully drowning, right? She fell

286
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,160
into the water and if you're all in the

287
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,680
water, you don't know how to swim,

288
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,839
you're dreading around. That's it

289
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,279
creates a fight orflight response,

290
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,560
right? Which should that should kick in

291
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,399
because you're fighting for your life.

292
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,240
And when that happens, what happens? you

293
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,560
pee all over yourself. You've heard that

294
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,160
phrase, right? You're going to pee. It

295
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,560
turns on all the autopilot nervous

296
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,079
systems of the body. But if that's not

297
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,000
what happened, but instead Natalie was

298
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,200
unconscious when she fell into the

299
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,720
water, then her body wouldn't have known

300
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
that she was in trouble, there would be

301
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,880
no fight orflight response, and

302
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,360
therefore it wouldn't appeared. The

303
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,880
bladder would be full. The autopsy is

304
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
more consistent with the bladder. Now,

305
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,240
this is pure speculation. pure

306
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,240
speculation, but it's interesting to

307
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,720
note that her bladder was full and

308
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,360
consistent. So, what was your reaction

309
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,279
to that Robert Wagner being named a

310
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,200
person of interest last year? I was so

311
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,920
relieved that that happened as well

312
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,920
because there's so much evidence in this

313
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,760
case. There's medical evidence, there's

314
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,000
scientific evidence, there's

315
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,600
corroborating witnesses, and there's

316
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,639
Dennis's eye and ear witness account.

317
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,760
And so many cases out there get

318
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,399
convictions with much less evidence

319
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,760
that's in this case. Nancy, as a

320
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,680
prosecutor, what does this mean to you

321
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,760
for Robert Wagner to be named a person

322
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,240
of interest? Well, it's not a suspect.

323
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,480
Once you're named a suspect, a whole

324
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,040
host of constitutional protections

325
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,240
surround you. But as a person of

326
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,800
interest, he should be worried. But when

327
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,519
uh you don't know a horse, Oz, look at

328
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,880
the track record. It's been all these

329
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,560
years, they've done nothing

330
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,839
and they're not going to do anything.

331
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,560
And I'm talking about LA law

332
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,399
enforcement. I'm calling them out. They

333
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,000
won't touch him. He was just out at a

334
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,760
fancy restaurant the other night with

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,760
his wife. He's not afraid of the

336
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,959
cameras. Why? He's got nothing to worry

337
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
about it because they're not going to do

338
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,120
anything. and Oz for nine years. I

339
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,360
worked at the Battered Women's Center as

340
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,040
a volunteer at night when I was a

341
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,079
prosecutor.

342
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,399
She left the yacht the night before,

343
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,000
right? She was so upset with the way he

344
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,839
was acting. It was so tense. She wrote,

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,199
she got a ride. She didn't take the

346
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,120
dingy herself. She stayed in a hotel on

347
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,360
land because she did not want to be with

348
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,760
Wagner. So, she comes back and she dies

349
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,160
the next night. Is that a coincidence?

350
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,399
And that night that she left the yacht

351
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,680
on Friday night, Natalie went on the

352
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,399
island with Dennis, she told Dennis she

353
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,639
was fed up with the way he was acting

354
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,279
and that she wanted to take a sea plane

355
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,000
in the morning and that never happened.

356
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,160
They ended up going back to the yacht

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and right to the secluded part of the

358
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,360
island where Natalie lost her life. So

359
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
we reached out to Robert Wagner's

360
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,279
attorney. We did not hear back in time

361
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,279
for this taping. In 2013, 2 years after

362
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,199
the case was reopened, she said in part,

363
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,199
"Mr. Wagner has fully cooperated over

364
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,720
the last 30 years in the investigation

365
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,440
of the accidental drowning of his wife

366
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,360
in 1981. Mr. Wagner has been interviewed

367
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,199
on multiple occasions by the Los Angeles

368
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,720
Sheriff's Department and answered every

369
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,480
single question asked of him by

370
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,760
detectives during those interviews."

371
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,680
It's also important for us all to

372
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,600
remember that Robert Wagner has only

373
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,000
recently been named a person of interest

374
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,000
and he has never been charged in Natalie

375
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Wood's death. Up next, an update from

376
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,240
Natalie's sister. Lana is here. She's

377
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,160
opening up about the sister she lost and

378
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,320
her ongoing fight for justice. Stay with

379
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,000
us. We are back with Crime Online's

380
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,160
Nancy Grace and investigative author

381
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,160
Marty Roelly asking what really happened

382
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,839
to Hollywood starlet Natalie Wood the

383
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,920
night she drowned. And joining us via

384
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,680
Zoom is Natalie's sister, her younger

385
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,000
sister, Lana's opening up about the

386
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,160
sister she lost and her fight for

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,680
answers. So Lana, after all these years,

388
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,199
what do you miss the most about your

389
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,560
sister and the life that she could have

390
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,519
lived?

391
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,720
H that's difficult to say the most

392
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,560
because it was such an encompassing

393
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,880
relationship that we had. Um Natalie was

394
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,759
my best friend. She was my surrogate

395
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:55,440
mom. She was I it she was everything to

396
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:58,000
me. I it just saddens me as to what the

397
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,720
relationship could have been today and

398
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,160
how it would have affected her children

399
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,240
and my child. Uh Lana, you think a lot

400
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,000
about your sister and there are lots of

401
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,000
theories about how Natalie died. What do

402
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,160
you think really happened to your sister

403
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,680
that night?

404
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,959
Um

405
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,519
Natalie was not having a terrific time

406
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,759
with R.J. They were going through a

407
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,959
problematic time. Natalie was working on

408
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,320
a film that she hoped would help her.

409
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:35,600
She had some issues with it.

410
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,720
Um, Natalie was angry

411
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,519
and preparing herself for bed. I believe

412
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,199
that Natalie and R.J. had a very bad

413
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,759
fight.

414
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:50,399
I believe that he is responsible for her

415
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,920
ending up in the water. I have always

416
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,519
said that I didn't think it was

417
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,320
premeditated,

418
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,880
that I thought it was anger out of

419
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,040
control at the moment. And that's the

420
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,799
only thing that I have left to hang on

421
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,000
to because it is the most horrendous

422
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,480
thought in the world that someone would

423
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,319
take the life

424
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,839
of someone else who means so much.

425
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,319
Um

426
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,959
Natalie Natalie was pushed overboard.

427
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,079
Natalie would not get in the dinghy.

428
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,280
Natalie would not leave. And I have

429
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,679
taken great affront to a couple of

430
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,600
things that R.J. has said, saying she

431
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,559
was probably, this is a direct quote

432
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,640
from you in his book, she was probably

433
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:41,520
going off to a party because she was a

434
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,000
woman like that. What a woman who went

435
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,559
to parties in her night gown.

436
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,120
The entire matter of um

437
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,679
how she got in the water is is just

438
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,440
ridiculous. She would not have gone

439
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,600
anywhere near. So you have worked

440
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,039
closely with detectives on your sister's

441
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,559
case. What new information are they

442
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,400
gathering right now? What insights can

443
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:07,919
you share with us? The only new thing is

444
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,280
they do have new witnesses. These

445
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,559
witnesses did not want to come forward

446
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,360
then and do not want to come forward now

447
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,440
and didn't. But these are important

448
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:24,720
people that know that Natalie and R.J. J

449
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,240
were the only two people on the back of

450
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,320
the boat fighting,

451
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,600
but they're willing but these witnesses

452
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,799
are willing to speak the truth now.

453
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,520
They're unwilling, but they have

454
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,960
they have spoken to the detectives.

455
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,840
Lana, thank you very much. I know how

456
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,240
painful this is to relive it. Good luck

457
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,880
with the case. Nancy, what would what

458
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:53,039
would justice mean for Natalie Wood? I

459
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,679
think justice would be the truth. Um,

460
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,039
like Lana was just saying, she does not

461
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,200
believe this was a a planned attack that

462
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,280
he took the boat there, the yacht there

463
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,280
in order to kill her, that it was an

464
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,320
anger attack. But whatever, Natalie is

465
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,039
dead. And I think her case should be

466
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,200
treated with the same respect and

467
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,799
dignity and effort that other cases are.

468
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,840
And it seems like her case has been put

469
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,360
in a file and shoved away.

470
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,520
I mean, why is he different? Because

471
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,520
he's a star.

472
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,160
Especially when I see the bruises.

473
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,760
Awful. Mhm. Makes it much more to talk

474
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,520
about on this. And this story is not

475
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,039
going anywhere. We'll be right back.

476
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,720
