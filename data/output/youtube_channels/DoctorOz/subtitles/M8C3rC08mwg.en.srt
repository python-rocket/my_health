1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,480
From the time I was 7 years old, I knew

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,280
I wanted to be a doctor. It was my

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
calling to heal and save lives. So, I

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,360
had a hard time understanding how

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,359
someone who was supposed to be a healer,

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,000
could be accused of murder. This is

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,080
2-year-old Benjamin. His parents, a

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,039
doctor and a nurse, were charged with

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,199
killing him. Today, in an exclusive

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,840
interview, Benjamin's parents are

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,640
speaking out. Did they have anything to

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,719
do with the death of their son? Crime

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,160
correspondent Melissa Moore is here with

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,239
the story. So Melissa, it gets everybody

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,559
interested. A doctor and a nurse accused

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,840
of murdering their defense's 2-year-old

17
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,520
child. What was the community's

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,200
reaction? Well, this became a

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,600
high-profile case right from the

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,360
beginning. The community was divided in

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,120
taking sides. Some wondered, were they

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,680
being treated differently because the

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,520
son was adopted from Taiwan? And then

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,440
also the medical community was divided

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,280
because of the science of child abuse,

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,960
which is really unclear. I thought it

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,439
was, but I've learned differently. And I

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280
must say in my mind was the idea that

29
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,439
this man might be either be given a

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
break because he's a doctor. His wife is

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,000
well because she's a nurse. Or maybe

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,640
it's the opposite. They're held to a

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
higher standard. Thank you very much,

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,400
Melissa. So after a three-month

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,880
investigation, Dr. James and Edelyn Yip

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,119
were charged with child endangerment.

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,840
Murder was a was the charge in the death

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,040
of their son, Benjamin. But six years

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,200
later, the charges were dropped. The ifs

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,640
now join me. Thank you very much for

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,479
being here.

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,079
Evelyn, let's start with your son's

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,240
medical condition. Tell us a little bit

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,799
about the problems that you identified

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,280
as you were adopting him. Well, it

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,000
appeared that he had some minor medical

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,799
problems uh when he was in the

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,640
orphanage. He had a problem with

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,119
something called tracho malaysia which

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
is a bit of a little breathing problem.

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,479
There was a question of whether or not

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,840
one of his kidneys was a little

53
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,840
misshapen but it didn't appear that

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,240
there were a large number of problems or

55
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,959
that they were very severe. He has a

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,480
twin Jonathan. Mhm. Any problems with

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:16,879
Jonathan? Not nearly uh to the level of

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,959
Benjamin. uh he didn't have any

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,360
demonstrated problems of significance in

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,440
the orphanage. So the IFPS allowed us to

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
look at Benjamin's medical records which

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,040
as you can see from my medical unit

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
carrying these papers is quite

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,800
extensive. That's for a 2-year-old.

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,200
Looking through these records the months

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
before Benjamin died, uh he was admitted

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
to the hospital for several health

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,360
issues. And I I've jotted these down.

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,080
There was malnourishment, there was

70
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,519
vomiting, dehydration, kidney failure,

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,200
vitamin deficiencies, staff

72
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,760
infection, several healing fractures in

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,920
the hands and feet. I mean, this is a

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,680
remarkable list of problems. You know,

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
in medicine, Dr. You know, since you're

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,280
a physician, you know this, but when

77
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,120
when you get a chart that's this thick,

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
you know, there's a big problem. And

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
that's for a 2-year-old. How do you

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,440
explain all of this?

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,040
Well, um, you know, I I don't think

82
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,280
there is a good explanation and we never

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,319
got a good explanation from any of the

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,640
physicians that we saw.

85
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:18,599
I was investigating non

86
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,440
u anatomical,

87
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,640
non-physiological potential causes on my

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,640
own. But, you know, we we continue to be

89
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,800
in this process of trying to find an

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,640
answer.

91
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,000
So, let's go back to the day that your

92
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,920
son, Edeline, if you can help me with

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,680
this, to say the day your son was found

94
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,480
unconscious. What happened? Um, I stayed

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,040
home that day because he wasn't feeling

96
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:49,280
well. Um, he had a feeding tube and um

97
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,560
the feeding tube alarm um went off. So,

98
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,760
I went into his

99
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:58,959
room and I found him unresponsive.

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,760
Unresponsive. You're so Yeah. You know

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,360
what that means? Not moving. He not

102
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,560
reacting. Yeah.

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,640
He wasn't breathing right.

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,640
So, what did you do? I freaked

105
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,640
out.

106
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,600
Um, I called

107
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,639
911 and

108
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:30,280
I I forgot how to do CPR. I forgot the

109
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:35,400
rate of chest compressions to to

110
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:38,440
breaths. Um I I turned him on his

111
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:43,440
side and he had some

112
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:46,560
food that came out of his mouth and I

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,080
freaked out.

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,280
There there are people watching who are

115
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,280
going to say you're a trained nurse. How

116
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,759
can you forget CPR when you need it

117
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,080
most?

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,120
I'm a

119
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:05,600
mom, first of all, and nothing could

120
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,039
ever prepare you in finding your child

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,960
not responsive and not

122
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:15,080
breathing. So, I couldn't remember.

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,440
When the EMS group

124
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,680
came, you were there with your son.

125
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,199
I gather he was relatively lifeless at

126
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,360
the time. When did you realize that he

127
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
had

128
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:39,600
passed? I didn't know what was happening

129
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,560
when they told us that it was a very

130
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:47,199
terrible thing and it was a grave

131
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,479
situation. I was in shock. I could not

132
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,639
believe

133
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:55,440
that that they were thinking that that

134
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,160
he was dying because we did everything

135
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,639
we can for

136
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,360
him. I I think

137
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:06,319
um you know the thing was is that he he

138
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,840
was on life support for several days um

139
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:13,360
before he actually um passed. Can I show

140
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:16,240
everybody what the medical records have

141
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,520
revealed? Sure.

142
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,199
So because you allow us to look through

143
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
the im the records, we don't have the

144
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,120
actual images, but we have a pretty good

145
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
idea of what the doctors were dealing

146
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,039
with. And I want everyone to understand

147
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,360
what issues were raised because then

148
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,759
you'll begin to appreciate why there

149
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,880
were accusations made and we all have to

150
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,440
look at this and try to decide in our

151
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,800
own minds what we think happened. So in

152
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,800
the chart it says that Benjamin had a

153
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,600
subdural hematoma. That means that he

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,520
had somehow injured part of his head and

155
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,800
there was bleeding under the surface of

156
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,400
the skull. You notice it's supposed to

157
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,440
be completely symmetrical and this is

158
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,199
not symmetrical and that caused a shift.

159
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,560
You notice these white lines are not in

160
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,880
the middle. The white lines are pushed

161
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,400
over and this black circle is supposed

162
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,440
to be some space in your brain. It's

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,919
completely missing here. Right? So this

164
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,080
means there was some head trauma that

165
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,000
pushed the brain over may have caused a

166
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
lot of these injuries. There were also

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,520
bilateral retinal hemorrhages. So in the

168
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
back of the eye there was bleeding and

169
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,199
this is together with this this other

170
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,240
findings considered a classic for a

171
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,000
shaken baby syndrome. Shaken baby

172
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,479
syndrome is now known as abusive head

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,120
trauma. Dr. Yip when you heard these

174
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,360
findings when they were shared with you

175
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,479
what were your first

176
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,560
thoughts? Well you know I went to

177
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,360
medical school as well and this is the

178
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,120
classic triad of uh shaken baby

179
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,800
syndrome. So, um, I knew that we would

180
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,639
be accused.

181
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,000
Adeline, when did you realize that

182
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,680
doctors were thinking that you might be

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,560
responsible for your child's injuries

184
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,680
and subsequent death?

185
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,080
When he

186
00:07:52,680 --> 00:08:00,639
um was flown to Sacramento

187
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:04,000
uh at a hospital there and the doctor

188
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,840
told us um about what they were thinking

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,840
about. I was I was

190
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,919
horrified. How could they after

191
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,160
all the things that we've done and after

192
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,479
his long

193
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:22,720
history of being

194
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,160
ill think that we would hurt our son?

195
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Just to clear the air, I'm going to ask

196
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:32,000
the question. Did you or your husband

197
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:36,440
ever abuse your son Benjamin? No.

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,440
It is hurtful to hear those accusations.

199
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,719
I've heard those accusations, but I know

200
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:46,720
I did not do anything to hurt my son.

201
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,800
Were you angry about the accusations?

202
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,600
Well, yes. I mean, you know, I I think

203
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,640
um I think I know why they happened and

204
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,560
but now I'm more upset knowing about the

205
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,480
science.

206
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,880
Up next, what caused Benjamin's injuries

207
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,440
and why was his brain swelling? The

208
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
answers when we come back. Benjamin Yip

209
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,360
was just two years old when his mother,

210
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,680
a nurse, found him unresponsive in his

211
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,560
room. In a panic, she says she forgot

212
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,240
how to do CPR for reasons still unclear.

213
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,320
Benjamin did not survive. We are back

214
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,080
with Benjamin's parents, Dr. James Yip

215
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,680
and his wife, Edeline. Dr. Yip, as you

216
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,720
would take your son, Benjamin, who you

217
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,040
had adopted when how how old was he? He

218
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,000
was 15 months when he came. I'm sorry.

219
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,240
18. 18 months. Sorry. When he came home.

220
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,440
So, uh, your adopted son comes into your

221
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,720
home. You're taking him to doctors

222
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,320
because things aren't right. What

223
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,680
diagnosis that sort of unify the problem

224
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,680
are you hearing? What do you must be

225
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,480
doing research on your own as well? Yes,

226
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,120
absolutely. And there was no diagnosis.

227
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,519
We had a number of people look at him

228
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,440
from his primary care doctor to

229
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,959
specialists at uh other institutions.

230
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,640
And you know, we they were focused on

231
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,320
specific parts of his diagnosis, but not

232
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,040
really a unifying diagnosis. What do you

233
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:10,880
think was wrong with him? Well, I'm

234
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,120
unsure myself why he was so ill um to

235
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,720
start with. So, after the paramedics

236
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
rushed Benjamin to the ER and examined

237
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,399
him, doctors believed his condition was

238
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,040
consistent with something called shaken

239
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,200
baby syndrome, which many of you have

240
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,880
heard of. It's called by physicians

241
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,079
abusive head trauma. After a three-month

242
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,279
investigation, Dr. Yip and his wife,

243
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,440
nurse Edelyn, were arrested and charged

244
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,880
with murder, child

245
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,000
abuse. Dr. Yip is a doctor. What's it

246
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,600
like to be arrested and charged with the

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,760
abuse of your child and the death of

248
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,440
your child? Yeah. Well, obviously it

249
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,079
perhaps not, but obviously it it

250
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,240
it speaks to the core of what I am

251
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,480
pledged to do, which is to help people.

252
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,720
And it is against that core

253
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,440
value. And when it occurred, it was

254
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,120
something that made me very upset. Uh,

255
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,200
you know, I was arrested at my place of

256
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,120
work um in front of all of my

257
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,800
patients. Um, why wouldn't you just go

258
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,200
turn yourself in?

259
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,000
We actually agreed to cooperate with the

260
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,160
sheriff's office

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,800
uh if they chose to do that, but they

262
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,680
chose to show up unexpectedly and do so

263
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,839
and arrest me there to make a statement

264
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,720
in your opinion. I I don't know. You

265
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,200
know, obviously they never actually made

266
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,160
specific accusations about who did what.

267
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,320
It's my belief that I was arrested in an

268
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:45,760
attempt to use the arrest as leverage to

269
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:49,200
either um turn against my wife or uh

270
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,560
somehow because of loss of income uh be

271
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,240
willing to make a

272
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,640
deal. Edeline, the theory is that you

273
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,200
were the last person with your son. You

274
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,040
delivered a fatal blow to his head. It

275
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
led to that bleeding and the swelling

276
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,519
and the other challenges and problems

277
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,279
that we talked about when I was showing

278
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,480
those images. How do you respond as a

279
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,920
mother to that accusation? I didn't do

280
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,519
it. I took care of my

281
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:21,279
son every day

282
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:23,279
and I didn't I did not hit him.

283
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,680
So after the arrest, authorities took

284
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,200
away your two other children.

285
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,320
to compounding an accusation

286
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,600
actually before the arrest. Yeah. They

287
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,079
took the children away from you

288
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,040
beforehand. Yes. They took I'm sorry. Go

289
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,519
ahead. They took the children away the

290
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:46,800
day after Benjamin went to the hospital.

291
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:49,200
So he was in the hospital dying and

292
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,399
child protective services ripped our

293
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,480
children away from our friends.

294
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,639
How do you deal with that? Grieving for

295
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,200
the loss of one son while seeing your

296
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:04,320
other two children taken from you. You

297
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,320
can't you can't grieve. We have not

298
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,399
had a time to fully grieve.

299
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
How how long were they taking from you

300
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,760
for? They were gone almost a year. A

301
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,760
year? Yes. Yes.

302
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,040
Let me just touch on one other issue

303
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,959
because I'm still stunned by this.

304
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,720
You're both working folks like so many

305
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,720
couples in America. Yes. There were

306
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,920
other caregivers involved with your

307
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,920
three children, all adopted.

308
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,360
Is there a possibility that someone who

309
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,680
cared for Benjamin may have been

310
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,600
involved in these injuries? No. No, we

311
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,279
we don't believe so. We don't think so.

312
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,680
I was the one who was a primary

313
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,079
caregiver. So, if anything happened, you

314
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,399
would have known about it. Yes. Up next,

315
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,800
a surprising twist in the case. Shaken

316
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,279
baby syndrome may not have caused

317
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,519
Benjamin's death. So, what did and who

318
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,920
was to blame? We're back with a doctor

319
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,320
and nurse who were accused of murdering

320
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,800
their son. Benjamin was just 2 years old

321
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,199
when he died after arriving unresponsive

322
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,000
to the ER. Doctors found his condition

323
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,680
consistent with shaken baby syndrome.

324
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,079
Benjamin's parents, Dr. James Yip and

325
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,839
his wife Edund are back with us. From

326
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,800
the beginning, both of you vehemently

327
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,760
denied the charges, the accusations that

328
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,240
you were responsible for shaken baby

329
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:26,240
syndrome. So, if that's not why Benjamin

330
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:31,560
died, why do you think he died?

331
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:34,560
I think he um he aspirated, he swallowed

332
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,399
um some of the the food that he ate that

333
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,079
evening, it got dislodged into his

334
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,680
lungs. that because when I remember when

335
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,360
I turned him over, there were pieces of

336
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,959
carrots and potatoes that were coming

337
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,760
out of his

338
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:53,839
mouth. So, I think he aspirated.

339
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,360
So, after more than six years of

340
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,440
fighting to prove their innocence,

341
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:03,040
prosecutors dropped the

342
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:06,240
charges. Big move. How does it feel to

343
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:11,000
be out from under those allegations?

344
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:14,160
It's freeing, but you know,

345
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,959
there's there's some not being able to

346
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,720
believe it's finally over.

347
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,480
Can I bring in an an expert in this area

348
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,279
because I want to get to this issue of

349
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,440
shaken baby syndrome. What is it really?

350
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,519
An attorney involved, Paige Kab from the

351
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,639
Innocence Project is joining us now.

352
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,639
Paige, thank you very much for being

353
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
with us. Thank you for having me, Dr. H.

354
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,519
I'm stunned here. I'm I'm I'm looking at

355
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,279
a couple of medical professionals who

356
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,720
are accused of murdering their child for

357
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,880
reasons that I completely understand. At

358
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,639
least I thought I did. You know, head

359
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
injuries, bleeding in the eye, things

360
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,199
that are consistent with this shaking

361
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,120
baby syndrome, which I thought I

362
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,680
understood. Why did the prosecutors drop

363
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,839
the charges? So, this is really a case

364
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,600
of guilty until proven innocent. And and

365
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,839
part of what happens in these cases is

366
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,519
when we when doctors see these injuries,

367
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,040
these findings, um there is this there's

368
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,040
they've been trained that this is shaken

369
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,279
baby syndrome or abusive head trauma.

370
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,720
And so they tell the the prosecutors

371
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,040
that and they of course believe the

372
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,120
experts. So we really had to prove that

373
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,759
the yips were innocent, that Benjamin

374
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,440
had had this lifelong serious illness,

375
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,160
that he was unable to shake these

376
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,160
infections. And that ultimately led to

377
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,079
the stroke which is one of the things we

378
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,920
had to show them was that strokes can

379
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,399
cause subdural hematomas which I know is

380
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,079
one of your questions. So this all

381
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,040
started with a British neurosurgeon who

382
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,480
was looking at a baby had a subdural

383
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,240
hematoma. Um and he was wondering how

384
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,079
does this baby have this internal trauma

385
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,959
and no external signs of trauma? No

386
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,720
bruises, no skull fracture, no swelling.

387
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,560
Um and he came up with shaking this idea

388
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,240
that maybe you shake a baby and that's

389
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,000
how you get this internal injury with no

390
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,000
external injury. And so he wrote a paper

391
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,600
to warn people about the dangers. It's

392
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,519
like taking an egg and shaking it really

393
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,120
hard, right? You'll scramble the egg on

394
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,040
the inside, but the shell will still be

395
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,040
intact. That's the basic concept.

396
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,279
Exactly. And that turned into this rash

397
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,360
of diagnosis. There are thousands of

398
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,880
potentially innocent people in prison or

399
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
who've had their families ripped apart

400
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,120
because of this diagnosis. And it got so

401
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,120
bad that that British neurosurgeon who

402
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,120
first came up with it came out in 2012

403
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,839
and said, "This is just a hypothesis."

404
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,520
And it's still an unproven hypothesis.

405
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,600
Emily, Emily, you're the the face of

406
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,720
this now. H how are you recovering?

407
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,400
Not knowing what the new normal is quite

408
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,079
yet.

409
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,000
Um it's it's been very difficult.

410
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:33,440
Um because now a lot of people know

411
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,799
about it and our children have questions

412
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,320
and it's

413
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,640
it's we've come to realize that we're

414
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,120
not alone in this battle. We were very

415
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,480
fortunate to have our community um stand

416
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,640
behind us and our faith. Um we were told

417
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,160
that if we wanted our kids back, we had

418
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,480
to get a divorce and we said no, we did

419
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,280
not do anything. We want our children

420
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:04,640
back. Um we stood firm on our belief and

421
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,360
knowing that we're innocent and we we

422
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,880
fought and to to get to where we are

423
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,240
today.

424
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,039
I would have thought you just put this

425
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:18,240
behind you, but you've agreed to come on

426
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:21,840
the show and tell your story. Yes. Why?

427
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,559
Well, I think um we want to encourage

428
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,080
people who may be accused to

429
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,640
actually to be honest with themselves

430
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,280
and don't let somebody convince you that

431
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,440
you've done something wrong. This is not

432
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,799
medical certainty, no matter what they

433
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:43,679
were told. And it seems that

434
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:47,039
our our attitude now is to believe an

435
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,640
accusation immediately as it is made.

436
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,720
And I hope that the public

437
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,840
will return to the true belief in

438
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,280
innocence until proven guilty.

439
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,679
I wish you the best with your two

440
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,440
children. Thank you, Paige. Thank you

441
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,799
