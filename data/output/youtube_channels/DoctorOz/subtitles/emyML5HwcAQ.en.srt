[Applause]

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,720
On the other side of this screen is a

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,279
whistleblower who is here to talk

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,960
directly to you. She's a manicurist and

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,840
has become very worried about the

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,599
chemicals in nail salons like yours.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,359
Today we're investigating. Is your

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,800
manicure bad for your health?

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,080
Whether at the salon or DIY, nail art is

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,000
hot. Some estimate last year in the US

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,240
there were 100 million nail polish

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,560
users.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,399
But now, many are worried if chemicals

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,960
from their manicure are entering their

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,760
bodies without them even knowing it.

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,680
Investigation squad member Tia Brown has

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,680
been following manicure and pedicure

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,480
health risks for us, even going

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,879
undercover to popular salons.

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,360
And now she's bringing us a brand new

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,480
investigation into what's really in your

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,399
polish. And for the first time ever, a

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,039
manicurist is appearing live in our

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,120
studio blowing the whistle on nail salon

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,719
conditions and her own fears over

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,479
whether she or her clients are at risk.

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,560
Joining me in studio is a nail

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,799
technician to talk about work conditions

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,720
at the salon where she works. She's

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,560
asked that we keep our identity hidden.

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,640
So, I'll ask you, thanks for being here.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,720
What is your biggest concern about your

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,439
safety at work? Hi, my main concern is

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,759
the products that I use on our the skin

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,080
and the products that we're breathing in

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,360
in the salon are causing cancer cells

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,040
that may later on appear in life.

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,520
>> And what about the clients whose nails

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,479
you manage every single day?

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,400
>> I worry about the pregnant women and the

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,600
children that do come in. I'm very

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,880
worried about them.

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,119
>> Well, thank you for stepping forward and

44
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,000
we'll keep your identity protected.

45
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,920
Investigation Squad member Tia Brown has

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,119
shipped away at the research to get to

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,560
the bottom of this. She's also going to

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,560
help me sort through the services

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,840
offered at a typical nail salon. Thanks

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,280
very much. She just heard the

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,799
whistleblower and we've heard from

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,320
others as well. Are her concerns about

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,759
the working conditions about the safety

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,159
of nail salon valid?

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,560
>> She is absolutely right to be concerned.

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,040
In fact, research shows that nail salons

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,800
have the same level of toxic fumes as

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,959
oil refineries

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
>> and car garages. Isn't that crazy?

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,440
>> Yeah. Who would have thought? Over

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,440
350,000 people in the US work at nail

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
salons. And studies have shown that

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,680
their exposure, their constant exposure,

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,640
mind you, they're working 52 plus hours

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,280
a week, results in them being at 100

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,720
times the risk to develop cancer.

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
>> That's a real occupational hazard.

68
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
>> Absolutely.

69
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,480
>> So the question is, what are the

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,480
chemicals and how are they affecting not

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,760
just the manicures but also you the

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
consumer? So let's start with the ones

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,480
we have in front of us.

74
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,400
>> Right. So you know the oldie but goody

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,560
is the acrylic, right? So that's one

76
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,560
when you use a synthetic nail usually on

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,080
top of your normal nail and you put

78
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,800
acrylic which is a mixture of different

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,200
components to to add to the top to make

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,080
sure it doesn't chip. The thing is you

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,680
usually dry under a UV uh ray which

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
something like this and so you're

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,000
exposed to different risk because of

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,560
that. In addition, the chemicals in the

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
compound also put you at risk. They're

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
toxic.

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,440
>> All right, so that's the acrylics.

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,280
>> That's the acrylic. The next thing was

89
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,959
gel. Now gel was the thing when it came

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,760
out. Looks great. Lasts for two weeks.

91
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,480
Here's the thing again, the powder mix

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,840
toxic. So, people heard the complaints

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,440
and they were like, "Let's do another

94
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,519
innovation." And it was the gel powder,

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,440
which doesn't require the UV ray, but

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,519
it's still dangerous because the powder

97
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,319
and the mix are still problematic for

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,680
your nails.

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,280
>> Of the things you just mentioned, the

100
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,840
three options, which one worries you the

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,680
most?

102
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
>> Acrylic. By far, research shows that

103
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
this is the most the one that you should

104
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
be most concerned with, mostly because

105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
of this, right? You use this to file

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,640
down the acrylic once you put it on. And

107
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,000
guess what? You're chipping away at all

108
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,000
of the chemical compounds. And guess

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,159
where they're going? Right into your

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,920
face. You're inhaling it. The manicurist

111
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,560
is inhering it. Inhaling it. It's not

112
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,480
good.

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
>> So, I get it. So, there's two ways the

114
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,560
chemicals from these products and

115
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
treatments can get into your bodies.

116
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,440
Through the skin and by breathing them

117
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
in. Let's start with the harmful

118
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,760
potential chemicals in the air.

119
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
Jennifer's here. Thanks for being here,

120
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,439
Jennifer. With her daughter, Alana. And

121
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
they're waiting for their manicure. But

122
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,840
even before their nails get painted,

123
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,319
they could be breathing in chemical

124
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,159
fumes. Now, we don't typically see the

125
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,920
fumes like you're seeing right here

126
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,920
coming up from the table in a nail

127
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,680
salon. This is a dramatization of how

128
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,360
fumes could be moving through the air

129
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,040
while you're getting a manicure. So,

130
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
what have recent studies shown about the

131
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,079
air at the at the different nail salons?

132
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,680
>> Unfortunately, it has a lot of um toxics

133
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,840
in the air. So, the toxins in the air

134
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,800
rather, they have the two major are BTX

135
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,040
compounds and uh formaldahhide and both

136
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,000
are very dangerous specifically to your

137
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,759
lungs. uh we know that it it can

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,240
unfortunately lead to asthma or

139
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,080
respiratory issues but there is a silver

140
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,280
lining in this I want to say right so

141
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,960
because we know people still want to get

142
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
their manicures and ventilation is the

143
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,759
key

144
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,240
>> right

145
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,479
>> the CDC released a report saying that if

146
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,639
the space is ventilated it reduces your

147
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,000
risk by up to 50%. Why? Because you're

148
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,960
not inhaling all of those fumes.

149
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,880
>> You're going to hear this message over

150
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,479
and over again for everybody. There are

151
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
some folks who are investing extra to

152
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
make sure you're safer.

153
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,680
>> I mean show them some love. Let's make

154
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
it a better industry. Okay, let's find

155
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,840
out if the chemicals from nail polish

156
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,080
are potentially absorbed through the

157
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,080
nail and skin.

158
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,000
>> So, is there any research about the

159
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,639
chemicals from the paint or the products

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
themselves?

161
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,280
>> Absolutely. Now, this was a little bit

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,080
scary, I have to say. Now, Duke and UW

163
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,120
UWG released a study that said that,

164
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,560
well, let me tell you what they did

165
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
first. So, they had two different

166
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,400
groups. They had one group of women who

167
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,759
got their nails painted and another

168
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,240
group of women who got their nails

169
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,080
painted, but they had on gloves. Guess

170
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,680
what they found? They did a urine test

171
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,240
and they found that the people who had

172
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,639
the direct contact with the polish had

173
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,560
more toxins in their system. And why?

174
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,440
Because they believe that the toxins are

175
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,280
getting in all around here. So every

176
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,520
time you're getting your nails polished,

177
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,960
you are exposing yourself to different

178
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
toxins. And I know it's hard news for

179
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
women, but it's just the truth.

180
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,800
>> All right. So we reached out to the

181
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
personal care council. Here's what they

182
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,560
said in part. Nail polish products have

183
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,320
been used safely for many decades by

184
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
millions of people. For many years,

185
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,600
information has been circulating in the

186
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
media alleging potential adverse health

187
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,800
effects from exposure to certain

188
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,759
ingredients in the Elcare products such

189
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,240
as taluine, formaldahhide, diabetalate.

190
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,680
The FDA also states on its website that

191
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,319
all of these ingredients based on

192
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,479
available safety information are safe

193
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,560
under current conditions of use in nail

194
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,240
products. So, they disagree, right? But

195
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,120
up next, we're going to show you what's

196
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,440
really in this little bottle, right? And

197
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,199
are the new better for you polishes less

198
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,240
toxic? You should know about this. In

199
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,840
the commercial break, I want you to go

200
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,520
out and grab your favorite color, right?

201
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,720
Bring your the nail polish bottle back

202
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,720
in front of the TV because we're going

203
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,479
to show you how to tell if yours has

204
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,800
potentially harmful chemicals in it.

205
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,639
Stick around. Have you guys ever

206
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
wondered what's really in here? You ever

207
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,520
thought about that? What's really in

208
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,199
your nail polish? So, during the break,

209
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,360
I ask all you to grab your favorite nail

210
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,039
polish and bring it back to the TV. Hope

211
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,319
you got it right. Did you get it right?

212
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,000
Look at the ingredients. Turn it around.

213
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,199
Look at the back. Do you see anything

214
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
there?

215
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,199
>> No. Nothing. You can't find them, can

216
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,639
you? Why? Because they're not there.

217
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,160
That's right. And most people have no

218
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,479
idea what's really in their nail polish

219
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,400
for a reason. Because it's not written

220
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,000
on there. Like foods write what's in

221
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,280
there, but these don't. So, how can

222
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,960
someone find out what chemicals are

223
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400
actually in their bottle of nail polish?

224
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
>> It's really important to do your due

225
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
diligence when it comes to nail polish.

226
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,560
Every brand will have their list

227
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,599
somewhere on the site.

228
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
>> All right. So, we got three nail

229
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,360
polishes here. T and I are going to give

230
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,199
you what's called the toxic trio of

231
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
potentially harmful chemicals, right,

232
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,120
that are in your nail polish that you

233
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,840
might want to avoid. So, as I paint the

234
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,240
nails,

235
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
>> all right,

236
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,280
>> and reveal the chemical, tell us which

237
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,599
one we should be worried about here.

238
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,720
>> Well, we don't want our nail polish to

239
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,240
chip. And unfortunately, thealdahhide is

240
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,880
the chemical that they put in nail

241
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,880
polish to ensure that it doesn't chip.

242
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
But guess what? It's a carcinogen.

243
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,919
>> Yeah,

244
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,680
>> it's not healthy. It's dangerous and

245
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,560
it's in most of our nail polishes.

246
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
>> All right, so we want to avoid

247
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,759
formaldahhide. That's a name that you

248
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,280
probably heard before and can remember.

249
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,800
Let's get to the second chemical. This

250
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,240
chemical is pretty toxic. You probably

251
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,479
have not heard of this chemical. By the

252
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
way, notice how daintily I paint inside.

253
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,800
>> He's doing a great job, right? We know

254
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,360
he's had lots of practice.

255
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,440
>> This is from

256
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,440
>> He's staying in the line.

257
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
>> Painting daughters and granddaughters

258
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,479
nails. All right. And what's the

259
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,199
chemical here?

260
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,080
>> DPB. And we know that this chemical is

261
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,280
so bad that it was actually banned in in

262
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,800
Europe.

263
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
>> We should not ingest it. We definitely

264
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,680
shouldn't have it on our nails. And it's

265
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,520
in a lot of our nail polishes. All

266
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,720
right. And the final product here is

267
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
something that you probably will

268
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,720
recognize with a little bit of help.

269
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,800
>> All right. So, how many people love when

270
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,759
their nail their nails are like nice and

271
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,560
shiny and smooth. It's no clump. Right.

272
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,120
>> Yeah.

273
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,519
>> Tuluene does that and it's in a lot of

274
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,519
our nail polishes. And again, it is a

275
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,880
toxin. It should not be in our nail

276
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,279
polish and it should not be in our

277
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,719
system.

278
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,919
>> All right. So, there's three chemicals

279
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,120
we just mentioned to you that we don't

280
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,040
want to have in there. Let's walk over

281
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,519
here. There's a brand new trend in nail

282
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,279
polishes that'll give consumers more

283
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,120
power in buying nail polishes without

284
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,120
these ingredients. So, the first is

285
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
called three free, right?

286
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,160
>> Which means

287
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,760
>> it doesn't have the three biggest toxins

288
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,760
in the nail polish. So, it's what?

289
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
Healthier for your system. And a little

290
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
bit of research helps you find which

291
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,800
ones are.

292
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
>> But even better, there's something

293
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,440
called five free.

294
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,000
>> Five free. That means it has even less

295
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,279
toxins. It's worth finding five free or

296
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
more. And it's important for your

297
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,720
health.

298
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,640
>> I noticed something when you came on the

299
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
stage today. It wasn't just a beautiful

300
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,760
ring. There's no nail polish on.

301
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,040
>> I don't have any nail polish on because

302
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,600
I was scared for a little while. All

303
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,680
right.

304
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,360
>> You do have to polish on, but my toes

305
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,880
are already polished.

306
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,920
>> We love them. We love our manicures and

307
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
pedicures. We just have to do it the

308
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
right way.

309
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,600
>> Right. All right. So, when you hear this

310
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,160
sound, right? You know, it's a great

311
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,000
moment to grab your camera, stop, snap,

312
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,760
and share. Right? So, we stop, keep on

313
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
the screen right now, this little

314
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,920
message to you, snap a pick of it, share

315
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,160
it on social media, and tag someone who

316
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
needs to see the message. I applaud any

317
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,839
new types of labeling that are a step

318
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,880
closer to full transparency. I'm proud

319
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,800
of the industry for making those

320
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,480
changes. You can go to dr.com to read
