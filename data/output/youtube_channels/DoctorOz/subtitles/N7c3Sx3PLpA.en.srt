00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,680
Everyone is talking about system 20. In

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,000
fact, on our digital platform, system 20

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,639
has been the most engaged with New

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,639
Year's plan we've ever rolled out. And

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,200
if you haven't started system 20, it is

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,520
not too late. Super simple. Go to dr.com

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,680
to print the system 20 checklist. It's a

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,439
shopping list. It's a one sheet. Become

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,800
part of the system today. We did all the

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,279
homework for you. Now, today we're going

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,199
to reveal system 20 sleep hacks and

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,039
stress busters. Because a good night's

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,199
sleep and the way we handle our stress

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,520
are cornerstones to good health and

16
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,559
weight loss. We have finally cracked the

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,320
code to finally get the rest you need to

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,239
have your body feel better in 2020.

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,879
First off, we want you to wake up at the

20
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,040
same time every single day. Right? This

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,879
establishes your circadian rhythm or

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,960
your internal body clock. Wake up the

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,280
same time every day and your body will

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,520
start to learn when to fall asleep, too.

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,239
You're building a memory. Next, you want

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,480
caffeine at 300 PM, right? And no more

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,480
after that. Caffeine takes a while to

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,680
wear off and can cause sleeping problems

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
even if you don't feel it. So, if you

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,239
don't want coffee, it's fine, but

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,040
certainly if you're a drinker, not after

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,840
3 p.m. And finally, put your phone down

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,439
1 hour before bedtime. Couple reasons.

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
The phones emit something called blue

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,159
light, which suppresses melatonin

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,920
production. So, when you're looking at

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
it, it'll turn off your brain's ability

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,080
to shut down. And friends, there's never

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,119
any good news after 10 p.m., right? So,

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,479
anything that comes in over your phone

41
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,080
after 10 is going to keep you up at

42
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,720
night. Now, Oz Team investigative

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
reporter Mars Avoc along with our system

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,560
20 test group have been documenting

45
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
their journey for the past four weeks.

46
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,960
Take a look.

47
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,360
>> System 20 is more than a plan about what

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
you eat. It also includes how to handle

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,400
stress and sleep.

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,040
>> It's 11:00.

51
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,200
Time to turn off my phone. Our system 20

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
testers have been monitoring their sleep

53
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,350
and stress for the past month,

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,159
documenting their success and struggles.

55
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,320
[Music]

56
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,960
>> I've been meditating 2 minutes every

57
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,799
morning.

58
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,439
>> Just gives me a supercharge.

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:04,719
>> Life seems to be getting easier.

60
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,880
I just looked at the clock and it is

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,200
306,

62
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,080
which means I have missed my deadline

63
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,160
for coffee.

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,640
It took a little bit of getting used to,

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,680
maybe a week or so. I'm feeling calmer

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,760
and I'm sleeping better.

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,840
Putting my phone away an hour before bed

68
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,400
is really hard. I'm trying to figure out

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,800
what I'm going to do for the next hour.

70
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,080
Like, I guess I could read a book.

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,040
>> Yikes. I did not realize how hard that

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,920
would be.

73
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,319
It's 4 weeks and getting up at 700 a.m.

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,599
I'm feeling much better because if I

75
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,040
snooze I lose.

76
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,440
>> So I told myself I get up every day at

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,400
6:00 a.m. And this is probably the

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,400
hardest thing I've ever done.

79
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,200
>> This waking up at 6:00 a.m. thing is

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,720
actually not that bad after all. To be

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,720
honest, I have way more energy now.

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
>> Marie, you look very well rested.

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,040
>> Oh, thank you, Dr. How is system 20 help

84
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,319
with your sleep?

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,000
>> You know, it's amazing how you can

86
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,840
program your body because at first it's

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,840
difficult, but now I want to fall asleep

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,159
at the same time and I naturally wake up

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
at the same time even on weekends. So,

90
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
that's been great. And I feel like, you

91
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
know, there's a saying, there's no

92
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
problem that can't be solved with a good

93
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,360
night's sleep. It helps me manage my

94
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,400
stress so much better. Things just don't

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
upset me as much. It's

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,280
>> the best feeling just lying down know

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,040
you got a couple hours of peace and

98
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,879
quiet, but you got to set up. It doesn't

99
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,400
happen by accident. So, Chris Tracy is

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,159
here. She has been tracking her sleep

101
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,120
with the sleep score app. So, what

102
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,879
changes has your sleep score uh actually

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
revealed to you that you might not have

104
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,640
appreciated?

105
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,400
>> Well, before system 20, my sleep was all

106
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,879
over the place. I was lucky if I got

107
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,680
five, six hours of sleep a night, tossed

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,959
and turned all night.

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
>> So, we actually you got you were kind

110
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,519
enough to get us your sleep score data.

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,159
Yes.

112
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,920
>> So, in that setting, your actual grade

113
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,560
was a 60,

114
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,280
>> which is, as you know, not quite good

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,879
enough, like barely passing. So, you got

116
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
started taking some of the advice

117
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,439
>> and what happened?

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,439
>> And then when I started using the sleep

119
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,840
app, I became more mindful of my sleep

120
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,959
and I'm happy to say I'm almost at that

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
eight hour mark.

122
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,640
>> You are? Yes.

123
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
>> And you feel it?

124
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,080
>> Yeah, I definitely feel better during

125
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
the day

126
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,599
>> because your sleep score number is The

127
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,199
last one we got was 86. So,

128
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,639
>> that's a huge difference, guys. Now,

129
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,600
Mar, you were struggling with the 3M

130
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,040
caffeine cut off.

131
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,880
>> That was hard. I'm an Italian girl. I

132
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,520
need my espresso. I drink it from when I

133
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,520
wake up till about 7 or 8 at night. It's

134
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,720
my fuel for the day. So, I really really

135
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,639
struggled with that. But I found that

136
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
with good nutrition, you're getting your

137
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,320
energy from other places. I was relying

138
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
on caffeine for my energy.

139
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,479
>> Come on. Let's meet because Mary Lee had

140
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,040
the same issue, same struggle and she

141
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,360
came up with a system 20 snack because

142
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
you use the list that we gave you. We

143
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,840
have all this helpful data, this

144
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,360
information we can share with you guys.

145
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,600
You just print them out. But the the

146
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,120
best part is this one pager that has 10

147
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,240
snacks on it. So, you put them together

148
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,960
into what? So, I made a system approved

149
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,520
a system 20 approved snack that is uh

150
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,160
uses all the ingredients and is also

151
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,880
healthy and tasty at the same time. I

152
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,600
used uh ingredients like uh flax seed

153
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,560
crackers and chopped walnuts for crunch.

154
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
I used u chickpeas, believe it or not.

155
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
That's why I call them is that what that

156
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,120
is?

157
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
>> Yeah, it is. And that's

158
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,280
>> This is brilliant,

159
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,919
>> isn't it? That's why they're called

160
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,440
fierce chick bites. Fierce chick bites.

161
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,400
>> Chick bites. These are chick bites.

162
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,320
>> Thank you. Yeah. And I also used 70% uh

163
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,240
chocolate chopped in there as well for

164
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,560
the sweetness because we don't add any

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,520
sugar. And I use blueberries in this one

166
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,639
too for the vitamin C. And I also uh use

167
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,600
coconut for

168
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
>> There's no sugar in this.

169
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
>> No, there isn't.

170
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,000
>> Wow.

171
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,360
>> And it um the coconut is good along with

172
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
the chocolate for brain and heart

173
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,440
health. So it's healthy and still tasty.

174
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,919
>> You are something else. You came up with

175
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,479
this idea.

176
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,479
>> Yes, I did.

177
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,080
>> I'm so proud of you. Really? You know

178
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,360
why it's good for you? But it the taste.

179
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,720
Forget about why it's good for you. You

180
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
would eat these. I'd have to pull them

181
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,520
away from you. Maybe we Maybe we can

182
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,759
share this with the audience. What do

183
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,880
you think?

184
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,400
>> Oh, we should. We should. Absolutely.

185
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,520
>> You want to taste some of these?

186
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,039
>> All right. Soon as we're done this,

187
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,479
we're bringing them over. All right.

188
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,919
Now, finally got Carolyn here. She's had

189
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,160
trouble putting her phone down an hour

190
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,160
before bed, which is actually my hardest

191
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,440
thing to do. I really struggle. So, you

192
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
actually found an app that I did not

193
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,520
know about that helps us do it.

194
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
>> Yes. You know what, Dr. Eyes? There is

195
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,560
an app. You get your iPhone. I'm going

196
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,319
to show you exactly. Please take us

197
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,919
through it. So, you get to your iPhone,

198
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,479
you go to your settings,

199
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,840
>> and then you go to screen time.

200
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,160
>> Well, there's there's actually a screen

201
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,440
time uh icon.

202
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,000
>> Yeah, exactly.

203
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,560
>> Then you go to downtime. Of course, you

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,759
got to turn it on. And then for the sake

205
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,520
of time, let's just say I'm going to go

206
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
to bed right now for the sake of time.

207
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
So, I'm going to change the time. You

208
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,039
have to set it for the time that you

209
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,520
actually want your phone to be shut down

210
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,400
or your apps to be shut down. So, it's

211
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,960
402

212
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,199
and I'm going to now

213
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,080
>> Oh, you it all shut down. Tik Tok,

214
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,680
Instagram, Facebook.

215
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,960
>> So, let's watch this. So, okay. Oh, I

216
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,919
want to go check Facebook because I'm

217
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,199
always on Facebook. Nope. Can't go.

218
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,120
>> I love this.

219
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,720
>> And then, okay, now let's try Instagram.

220
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,720
Nope. Can't do it.

221
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,479
>> This is brilliant. Yeah, obviously it's

222
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
important the manufacturers of these

223
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,520
products realize it's good for us to be

224
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
able to do this. Thank you, Carolyn.

225
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,639
Next, if meditation just isn't your

226
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,240
thing, well, it could be because you're

227
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,400
doing the wrong one. When we come back,

228
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,280
a quiz to find out your system 20

229
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,720
meditation type. Stick around. If you're

230
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,800
checking your New Year's resolution

231
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,319
stressless boxes but are having trouble

232
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,400
shutting off your thoughts for the

233
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,560
morning meditation, it might be because

234
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,800
you're doing the wrong one. So, we

235
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,680
developed a system 20. What's your

236
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,880
meditation type quiz? And it all starts

237
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,120
with everyone just stop what you're

238
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,440
doing, close your eyes, and picture

239
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,360
yourself at the beach. All right, we

240
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,919
want you to focus on your senses. What

241
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,400
do you see? What do you hear? What do

242
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,199
you feel? In fact, is already at the

243
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,280
beach. She's practicing. So again, which

244
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,599
one stands out most? Is it the colors?

245
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,479
Right. Right. The bright blue sky and

246
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,080
binding sun, right? Is it the sound of

247
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
the waves crashing? That's what's

248
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,160
attracting your attention. Or is it the

249
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,919
feeling of the sand beneath your toes

250
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,319
wiggling around because you're a tactile

251
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,080
person? So, which sense is speaking to

252
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,960
you?

253
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,720
The the sound of the waves crashing

254
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
definitely is speaking to me right now.

255
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,039
>> I knew you'd be auditory.

256
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,479
>> Yes, absolutely.

257
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,560
>> Come on up here. I'm going to show you.

258
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,639
This is fascinating. Actually, we don't

259
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,080
all resonate to the same thing. So,

260
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,120
you're going to use whatever you were

261
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,039
paying attention to in that little

262
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,879
meditation we're doing as your guide.

263
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
So, if you're someone who likes to focus

264
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,319
on a scene, for example, this beautiful

265
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,080
ocean or any visualization, then it's

266
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,599
fine. Then you're a visual person,

267
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
right? Focus on an image that you find

268
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
relaxing. Fills you with that warm and

269
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,760
fuzzy feeling. For me, it's the

270
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,159
grandkids.

271
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,599
>> Okay?

272
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,760
>> Yeah. Put them up there. If I have this

273
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,200
in front of me, it just relaxes me. You

274
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,600
know, they don't usually lie like this

275
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,920
peacefully, but when they do, capture it

276
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,720
and it makes you happy. Now, if you're a

277
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,399
listener like Renatha, you want to try a

278
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,160
mantra meditation. This type of

279
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,680
meditation uses a repetitive sound to

280
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,519
clear the mind. You want to do one with

281
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,600
me? Yeah. Okay. How about

282
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,839
>> three, two, one? Um,

283
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,680
>> get my note. Oh,

284
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,680
>> you're all good at that. And that'll get

285
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,519
you in that place you want to be.

286
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,839
>> Sometimes though, you're a tactile

287
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,839
person. You prove you like this movement

288
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,839
meditation approach. So, a simple

289
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,839
stretch or a light jog will often free

290
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,959
you so your mind can do what it needs to

291
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,800
do, which is to relax.

292
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,640
>> Stretch. All right. I I do it during

293
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
yoga. Actually, it works for me. So, all

294
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,600
the resources you need to get started on

295
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,519
system 20, including a link to my

296
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,760

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,440

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,720
Take advantage of it. Stuff's all free.

299
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,120

300
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,800
the power of you. One person, one voice

301
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
speaking the truth. Goodbye, everybody.
