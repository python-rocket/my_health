1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,160
The Coline shooter's mother. Many say

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,840
you're the mother of a killer. Is that

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,160
fair? Sue Clebald. Were you ever scared

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,080
of Dylan? Her biggest regret. Do you

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,000
think you're a good mother to Dylan?

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,640
Could she have prevented the Coline

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,359
tragedy? Something went wrong in his

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,439
thinking. Sue Clebald. What you haven't

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,199
heard? If Dylan was sitting in my seat,

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,439
what would you want him to hear? Coming

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,439
up next.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,480
Today, a special edition of our show,

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,320
Coline. A word that is synonymous with a

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,040
tragic wave of school shootings that

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,040
continue to plague our nation. Coline

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,120
may still be the most notorious of them

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,680
all, thanks to the meticulous and

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,719
cold-blooded planning by Dylan Clebold

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,280
and Eric Harris. Imagine being the

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,760
parent of one of those shooters. It's

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,239
been 17 years since that infamous day in

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,480
April. And for the first time, Dillian

23
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,039
Clebolt's mother, Sue, is finally

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,039
breaking her

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,600
silence. This is a photograph of Dylan

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,880
Clebolt. At the time, he was 17 years

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,920
old. And this photo from the same year,

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,200
Dylan on his way to the prom. Can you

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,200
see any signs that just 3 days later he

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,880
would participate in one of the worst

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,840
school shootings in American

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,080
history? On April 20th,

33
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,240
1999, Dylan and his friend Eric Harris

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,600
entered Coline High School with

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,320
explosives and automatic

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:42,000
weapons. By the time it was over, 14

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,520
students and one teacher were dead. 24

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,240
more were wounded. Dylan and Eric took

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,720
their own

40
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,119
lives. Dylan and Eric's murder suicide

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,680
left their families, their community,

42
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,439
and the world with profound questions we

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,119
still struggle to answer. How could this

44
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,000
happen? What was going on in the minds

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,920
of these young men who killed? Could

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,720
anything have been done to stop it?

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,080
Dylan's mother, Sue Klebolt, has been on

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,640
a 17-year journey in search of answers.

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,319
A long, painful quest leading to the

50
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,000
publication of her book, A Mother's

51
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,599
Reckoning. Today, what Su Klebold

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,120
learned as she struggled to come to

53
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,120
terms with the actions of her

54
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:37,840
son. You've been quiet for 17 years.

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:42,160
Why' you decide to go public now?

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,160
Well, the tragedy was so horrendous. So

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,920
many lives were lost. So many people

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,000
were

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,480
hurt. And from the very beginning, I

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
didn't understand really what had

61
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,879
happened, what my son's role in it was.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,360
It took a very long time to even

63
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:02,159
understand his role in the tragedy. It

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,280
took additional time for me to process

65
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,680
that to get through it to uh do a lot of

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,680
personal work around the loss.

67
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,760
And then I started doing a lot of

68
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,560
research to try to understand how he had

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,440
died and how what state of mind he might

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,440
have been in to harm so many people so

71
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,519
viciously. Um so I guess the one-word

72
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,440
answer to that is readiness. I just

73
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,280
wasn't ready until now.

74
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,599
So, it's a sensitive topic. Obviously,

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,720
you've lived it for all these years.

76
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,360
This is a book where it's remarkably

77
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,080
gripping. I stayed up literally most of

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,159
the evening trying to absorb the

79
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
information that was so important in it.

80
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,360
And I don't think I'll ever forget some

81
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,680
of the lessons you shared, many of which

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,440
we'll cover. But you're not making money

83
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
from the book. Correct. You're donating

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,959
all the proceeds to mental health work.

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,480
All my share. all your share after of

86
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,360
the profits. So, let's start on April

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,519
the 20th, 1999,

88
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,360
the day of the Coline shootings. How did

89
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,080
you find out that there was a problem?

90
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,519
That day began um very early in the

91
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,360
morning for me. I was getting ready to

92
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,919
go to

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,560
work and it was dark because I used to

94
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,800
go downtown. I had to get up very early.

95
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,759
It was not time for me to give Dylan his

96
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,639
wakeup call yet. Mhm. His bedroom was

97
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,400
upstairs and mine was down. And while I

98
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,960
was getting dressed for work, I heard

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,919
him thundering down the stairs with

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,880
heavy footsteps. He ran right past my

101
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,440
bedroom door. I was very surprised that

102
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,960
he was up early. I leaned out my bedroom

103
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,120
door and all I could see was darkness. I

104
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,520
couldn't see him. And I said, "Dill."

105
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,560
And then I heard his voice in the

106
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,280
darkness by the front door. and he said

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,240
bye and he slammed the front door and

108
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,280
left. So the last word he said to you

109
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,080
was by. Yes. How did you find out that

110
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,639
he was one of the shooters?

111
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,000
That process sort of evolved a little

112
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,960
bit slowly. The first inkling I had of

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,720
the tragedy was when I was at work. I

114
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
was getting ready to go to an afternoon

115
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,960
meeting. I had stepped away from my desk

116
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,280
and the red message light was flashing

117
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,280
on my phone. Mhm. When I came back to

118
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,880
answer and and listen to the message, it

119
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,960
was my husband's voice. And it sounded

120
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,520
ragged and breathless in a way that I

121
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,600
had never heard him speak before. And he

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,080
said, "This is an emergency. Call me

123
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,520
back immediately." Mhm. From the tone in

124
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,880
his voice, I knew something had happened

125
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,720
to one of my children. I just knew it.

126
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,000
Um, I called him back and he was in a a

127
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,840
state of great agitation and he said,

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
"Listen to the television." And he put

129
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,360
the phone down in front of the

130
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,600
television and I couldn't hear what was

131
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,639
happening. But I thought, "If something

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,319
is on television, that's huge. This is

133
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,280
not just simply there's been an

134
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,680
automobile accident." And I yelled,

135
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,759
"What's happening? What's happening?"

136
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,840
And uh my husband got back on the phone

137
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,000
and just started blurting out, you know,

138
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,759
there's been a shooting at the school.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
People in trench coats are hurting

140
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,479
people. Uh Dylan's friends don't know

141
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,440
where he is. He wasn't in in his in his

142
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,240
first class this morning. And it was

143
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,120
sort of a cascade of terror and trying

144
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,600
to put these pieces

145
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,440
together. It took me the full day to

146
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,600
learn that my son had

147
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,759
died. Uh, and toward the end of the day,

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,639
I was able to listen to the news reports

149
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,639
and hear how some of the other victims

150
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,880
and their conditions, if they were in

151
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,360
hospitals, and their estimates of how

152
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,000
many were

153
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,759
wounded. And from that point until six

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,440
months

155
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,880
later, I believed that my son was

156
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,440
there, perhaps not under his own

157
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,160
valition, maybe accidentally, maybe he'd

158
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,680
been tricked or coerced.

159
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,520
Uh, I had a very strong amount of denial

160
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,599
about his role in this. And it wasn't

161
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,639
until we got the police report six

162
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,800
months later that I really had to

163
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,639
acknowledge what he had done. What goes

164
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,960
through your

165
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:28,479
mind when you realize your son killed 12

166
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:31,319
students, a teacher, wounded 24 more?

167
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:36,039
I don't think there's any way to

168
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:39,360
describe the agony that I feel, the

169
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,360
humiliation, the

170
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:48,360
sorrow. It's it's incomprehensible to

171
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,360
even try to explain it to someone.

172
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,199
The only and here's a very small analogy

173
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,840
and it's probably ineffective but

174
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,400
imagine that you're taking a beloved dog

175
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,720
for a walk and you're holding the leash

176
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,680
and while you're holding that leash that

177
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,639
dog attacks and kills others and you're

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,800
holding the leash and that's very much

179
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,840
the way it felt like how could this have

180
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,800
happened? He was my son. I was caring

181
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,400
for him. I was loving him. Just

182
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,440
bewilderment

183
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:24,000
um pain. so many horrible feelings. The

184
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
days leading up to the shooting, did you

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,120
notice anything that was changing in

186
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:33,120
him? Any acute issue that might have set

187
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,680
him off? No, not at all. Um, three days

188
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,159
before the shootings, he went to a prom

189
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,959
with his friends and 12 kids rented a

190
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,159
limo together and went out for dinner.

191
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,000
and he came back early the next morning

192
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
and we talked in the hallway and he told

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,640
me he'd had the best time he'd ever had

194
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,080
in his life and thanked me for sending

195
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,200
him. He talked with his friends about

196
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,600
his future and which one would come back

197
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,440
with a muscle car that he or she wanted

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,959
and um there was no indication that I

199
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,120
could see that he was deeply troubled or

200
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,519
dangerous.

201
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,959
What did you feel? What was going on

202
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,800
when you first learned your son had

203
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,680
died?

204
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,959
That he was actually gone.

205
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,640
We the day of the shootings, the uh

206
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,080
police, the sheriff's department and

207
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,080
actually it was different sheriff

208
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,920
sheriff's departments had come to our

209
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,959
house and they had sent a SWAT team and

210
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,279
we were asked to leave our

211
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:33,360
house. So we were all asked to remain

212
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,600
outside and I was sitting on the ground

213
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,480
for most of the day sitting outside on

214
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,680
our our front walk.

215
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,080
And all day long I kept asking, "Is

216
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,880
Dylan alive? Can you tell me what's

217
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,640
happening with my son?" I didn't know

218
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,440
what was happening in the school. I

219
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,200
heard through an open

220
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,360
window a fragment of a news report where

221
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,000
they said 25 people are believed to be

222
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,959
dead.

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,839
And I I was I just kept trying to find

224
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,600
out what had happened to my

225
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,360
son. Toward the end of the day in the

226
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,440
late afternoon, I think one of the

227
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,839
officers took pity on me and

228
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:17,279
said is I said is I asked is my son dead

229
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,399
and he said yes he is and I said how did

230
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,880
he die and he said I don't know.

231
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,720
Was part of the recovery learning to to

232
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,959
grieve for your son or was that

233
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,360
difficult knowing that he'd killed all

234
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,360
those other kids?

235
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,640
When a murder suicide occurs where you

236
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,040
love someone and they harm other people

237
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,320
and then take their own lives, it's a

238
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,399
very complicated grief

239
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,839
process. First, there is the horrible

240
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,880
sorrow of knowing that he hurt so many

241
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,760
people that their lives were devastated

242
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,839
and I had that burden of feeling somehow

243
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,200
I didn't know how but feeling somehow

244
00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:00,320
responsible because he was my child.

245
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,480
On top of that comes the uh probing eye

246
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,480
of the media, the accusations and that

247
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,640
develops fear and paranoia. Uh you

248
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,959
become afraid. I was certainly fearful.

249
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,640
I I feared for our safety. I I know that

250
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,800
when I went back to work,

251
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,680
um my supervisor showing me the back

252
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,920
staircase so that if someone invaded my

253
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,920
personal space, if the media showed up

254
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,279
uh unexpectedly, I could have a way to

255
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,600
get out. Mhm. And on top of all that is

256
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:34,079
grief for your for your own lost loved

257
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,920
one and uh we were being sued. So I had

258
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,760
those kinds of issues where I was

259
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,600
worried about the lawsuits and what

260
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,720
would happen and if I would lose our

261
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,800
home and if we would be bankrupt. And it

262
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
was through

263
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,560
therapy. I had a wonderful therapist who

264
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,360
was a grief specialist.

265
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,360
and she helped me get through this by

266
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,240
emphasizing the importance of focusing

267
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,920
on grief. She said there's nothing you

268
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,440
could do about all these other things.

269
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,360
That the real thing I needed to work on

270
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,519
personally was to feel the grief of my

271
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,480
own loss and that these other things

272
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,760
would come in time and I would be able

273
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:16,000
to find answers. So I think early on I

274
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,079
was sort of pushing myself into allowing

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
myself to grieve. Were you able to

276
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,920
grieve for the victims, the kids who had

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,720
died that day?

278
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,560
I have grieved for them in so many ways

279
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,399
over the years.

280
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,200
Um to this day when I hear anything

281
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,040
about one of the victims or I see

282
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,760
children in a grocery store with one of

283
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,160
their parents and I think look the kids

284
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,480
this this child is just like you know

285
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,800
this beautiful relationship between a

286
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,680
parent and a child and Dylan took that

287
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,279
away from them. I will still cry when I

288
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:55,200
hear things about that.

289
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:59,639
Um I will never stop really grieving for

290
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,639
all these losses. I don't think

291
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,360
there was a stockpiling of guns

292
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,399
including semi-automatic weapons and

293
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,480
shotguns. Multiple rounds of ammunition,

294
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,320
homemade bombs. Yes. I'm sure I'm not

295
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,560
the first person to ask this, but how is

296
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,880
it possible that all this could take

297
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,279
place without you knowing about it?

298
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,800
Coming up next,

299
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,959
Michael Straan is back. Now, he gets

300
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,200
real about his dad's health scare that

301
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,399
was a wakeup call for him. I look back

302
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,040
now, it actually changed my life. Plus,

303
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,160
Shannon Dhy's cancer crisis. How she's

304
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,120
fighting back. All new

305
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,120
Oz. That's coming up tomorrow.

306
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,959
Every piece of evidence from the Coline

307
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,959
High School shooting is in this

308
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,959
building.

309
00:13:50,940 --> 00:14:04,450
[Music]

310
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,279
Let's talk about the evidence. About 6

311
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,480
months after the

312
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,320
shooting, you're able to see what the

313
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,920
police had gathered information about

314
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
what was happening with your son and

315
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,440
with Eric Harris. What did you and your

316
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,079
husband learn?

317
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,079
We had been believing that Dylan, as I

318
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,240
said, was

319
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,560
somehow not quite responsible for this,

320
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
that that he had been there, but he

321
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,720
couldn't have done the things that they

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,079
said he was doing. When we went to the

323
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,320
police um presentation six months later,

324
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,880
we learned that everything we had

325
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,519
believed was wrong, that he had planned

326
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,079
the attack, that they had planned the

327
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,720
attack together for some time, that

328
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,199
Dylan was actively shooting others with

329
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,680
the intent of killing them, that he was

330
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:59,160
sadistic and hateful and

331
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:02,560
cruel. And for me that introduced a

332
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:06,399
new a new situation to grieve for. And I

333
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,560
think that particular phase of this I it

334
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,040
started the grief process entirely all

335
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,320
over because I had to reframe who Dylan

336
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,360
was to me. So hard to acknowledge that.

337
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,360
Mhm. Yes. Let me go through some of the

338
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,880
evidence that was revealed. There was a

339
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,000
stockpiling of guns, including

340
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,399
semi-automatic weapons, and shotguns,

341
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,560
multiple rounds of ammunition, homemade

342
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
bombs. Yes.

343
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,800
I'm sure I'm not the first person to ask

344
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,079
this, but how is it possible that all

345
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,079
this could take place without your

346
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,440
knowing about it?

347
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,600
I wish I knew. Um, I was in and out of

348
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,040
Dylan's room.

349
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,639
I think the answer to that is I believed

350
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,639
in the goodness and wellness of my son

351
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,720
and I was parenting a child that I

352
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:57,440
believed to be healthy and not at risk.

353
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,600
If I had believed he was at risk, I

354
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,440
would have been searching more for

355
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,120
things that were a threat. But um and

356
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,839
certainly I was the kind of mother who

357
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,040
did search. Uh he and his friend Eric

358
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:14,000
had gotten arrested for theft 14 months

359
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,959
before they died. And I searched his

360
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,720
room regularly, but at the time of

361
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,199
Dylan's death, he was a graduating

362
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,440
senior. He was a few weeks away from

363
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,839
ending his senior year. He'd been

364
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,519
accepted at four colleges. He had

365
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,600
demonstrated to us that he was um doing

366
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,199
everything that was expected of him and

367
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,800
that he was looking forward to his

368
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,920
future. He'd been accepted at four

369
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,480
colleges. he was going to a prom. I

370
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,120
didn't see any indications that anything

371
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,000
was wrong. And whatever he was doing was

372
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,480
very well hidden. And I did not think to

373
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,199
look for it. I did not know it existed.

374
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,839
We had always been an anti-gun family.

375
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,480
We didn't own any. We never thought that

376
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,279
someone in our family could own a gun.

377
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,199
The idea that a 17-year-old boy could

378
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,240
have purchased a gun without our

379
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,439
knowledge was appalling to us. So, we

380
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,760
didn't even know such a thing was

381
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,280
possible. Let's pursue that because

382
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,400
there are these so-called basement

383
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,679
tapes, videos that you learned about 6

384
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,760
months after the Coline shooting. What

385
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,199
did you feel when you saw your son on

386
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,439
those videotapes with guns? I felt ill.

387
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,799
I remember um standing

388
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,799
up right after or during the

389
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,640
presentation because I thought I was

390
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,280
going to be sick and I want I almost

391
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:38,200
left the room. It was a terrible,

392
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,200
terrible shock to see that and to learn

393
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,840
that he not only was capable of doing

394
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,840
what he did, but but they had the

395
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,360
wherewithal and the means and were able

396
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,640
to obtain all these

397
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,200
materials. It was astounding and

398
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,559
baffling and horrifying. Did you

399
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,640
recognize your son in those videos? Was

400
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,720
that your boy?

401
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,799
It certainly didn't appear to be to me.

402
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,520
this was not the child that I

403
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:10,880
recognized. I think um in some of those

404
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,280
tapes it appeared to me that he was

405
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,000
posturing. He was doing theater. He was

406
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,600
trying to be dramatic and tough and kind

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,679
of performing in perhaps on Eric's

408
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,000
behalf and on on behalf of anybody who

409
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,120
would look at those tapes.

410
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,200
But it was not the child I recognized at

411
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,039
all. As you processed all this evidence

412
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,640
against your son, did it change how you

413
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:40,720
felt about him? For a brief time, it

414
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:44,160
did. And uh there was even a moment when

415
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,120
I felt that I hated him. I think I began

416
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,840
to feel over time that Dylan was a

417
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,280
victim of his own thinking and his own

418
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,520
malfunctioning mind. in in in thinking

419
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,280
that in believing that it was not

420
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:04,360
possible to maintain any level of anger.

421
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,360
Were you ever scared of Dylan?

422
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,679
And I remember pushing him against the

423
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,039
refrigerator, you know, shape up. Stop

424
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,720
thinking of yourself. Think of other

425
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,679
people in your family. And he took a

426
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,000
deep breath and he said,

427
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,520
"Mom, please stop pushing me. I don't

428
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,080
know if I'm going to be able to control

429
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,520
my anger." Coming up next.

430
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,760
Michael Strahan is back. Now he gets

431
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,000
real about his dad's health scare that

432
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,480
was a wakeup call for him. I look back

433
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,520
now and it actually changed my life.

434
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,960
Plus Shannon Dhy's cancer crisis. How

435
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,320
she's fighting back. All new

436
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:45,400

Journal entry. April

438
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:51,120
1999. Dylan, wherever you are, I love

439
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,320
and miss you. I'm struggling in the

440
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,039
chaos you left behind. If there is any

441
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,440
way to absolve you of these actions,

442
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,480
please point the way. Help us find

443
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,320
answers that will give us peace and help

444
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,919
us live with this life we have been

445
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,919
thrust into. Help

446
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:18,720
us. Were you ever scared of Dylan?

447
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,480
You know, I was never afraid of Dylan.

448
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,240
There was one moment though where we

449
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,080
were having a confrontation and it was

450
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,480
the only time that I ever remember the

451
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,400
two of us having a

452
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,000
confrontation. Um it was a time when he

453
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
had forgotten to get me a Mother's Day

454
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,880
gift and everything was seemed to be

455
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,280
falling apart in my personal life. Uh my

456
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,159
husband was ill and our other son was

457
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,240
struggling to stand on his own two feet

458
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,280
and Dylan forgot to get me a Mother's

459
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,840
Day gift and he had forgotten to do some

460
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,080
things that were his

461
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,080
responsibility and I remember pushing

462
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,840
him against the refrigerator and really

463
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,159
giving him a mom lecture. I mean I was

464
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,520
just like you know shape up, stop

465
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,600
thinking of yourself, think of other

466
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,360
people in your

467
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,080
family. And Dylan was quite a bit taller

468
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,039
than me. And he stood up and he took a

469
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,360
deep breath and he said,

470
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:12,880
"Mom, please stop pushing me. I don't

471
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,080
know if I'm going to be able to control

472
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,880
my anger." And that did startle me. I

473
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,240
mean, it really took me a back for a

474
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,240
moment. But the fact that he had said

475
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,640
that and said it gently and said it

476
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,400
quietly dispelled any fear reaction. I

477
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,000
was a little bit a little bit for a

478
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,840
moment frightened slightly but I felt

479
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,480
that my uh pushing him and yelling at

480
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,799
him was really my error that I wasn't

481
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,960
parenting properly that I was saying to

482
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,120
myself what are you doing here you're

483
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,200
not handling this very well so we

484
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,880
immediately

485
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,200
separated I apologized to him he

486
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,760
apologized to me later that day he went

487
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,000
out and got me a gift and it was a day

488
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,600
where I thought we had sort of resolved

489
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,240
things

490
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:06,240
in the book. You blame Eric Harris for

491
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:11,360
at least getting your son involved

492
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,919
in a way that allowed Coline to happen.

493
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,440
I don't I don't like the word blame and

494
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,720
I don't believe that is what I

495
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,760
feel. I believe that

496
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:26,320
Eric was blatantly homicidal. what they

497
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,320
did was so terrible and so evil. I know

498
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,080
it's out of the bounds of somebody who

499
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,840
is troubled and I know that and that's

500
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,840
why I worked so hard to try to

501
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,480
understand it.

502
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:41,200
But I think that for whatever they were

503
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,440
experiencing, there was a kind of a um

504
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,360
almost a magnetic attraction that they

505
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:50,000
fulfilled each and the other

506
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,919
um something that the other needed to to

507
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,960
do whatever it was they felt they were

508
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,120
going to do. Do you forgive Dylan for

509
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,120
the shooting?

510
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,320
It is a very difficult question to

511
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,919
answer because I understand the

512
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,799
sensitivity of that

513
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:13,679
answer. By loving and forgiving my son,

514
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,880
I know that that aligns me with someone

515
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,159
who was a

516
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,960
killer. In my mind, Dylan, something

517
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,360
went wrong in his thinking. We could see

518
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,240
a full two years before this happened

519
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,320
that he was having suicidal thoughts and

520
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,360
feelings. They were not treated. They

521
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:37,600
got worse and

522
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:40,000
worse. And I feel that Dylan was a

523
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,039
victim of his own disorder of what was

524
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,240
going on in his mind. So forgiveness

525
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:49,360
isn't even really a piece of this.

526
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,720
Do you still love Dylan? Absolutely.

527
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,039
Every minute, every day, he's with me.

528
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,039

that had lost loved ones at Coline. I

532
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,080
know the mother that I met first, the

533
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,320
first thing she asked me was, "Who was

534
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,159
Dylan?" And I thought that was the most

535
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,790
beautiful gift anybody could give

536
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:24,250
me to ask that

jackhammer to me. Even those uttered

most

541
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:42,159
quietly. His thoughts are never aligned

542
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,559
with mine. They always come from far

543
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,650
away and they're totally foreign to my

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,520
There was so much anger and hostility

547
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,320
directed towards you after the Coline

548
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,720
shooting. What was it like to go to

549
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,240
Littleton, Colorado as a home and live

550
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,039
there? What were the sentiments to your

551
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,840
family after the massacre?

552
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,919
I thought a lot about that. I I gave it

553
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,520
serious

554
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:13,520
consideration. Um, but what I ultimately

555
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,679
decided was that I needed to be near my

556
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,200
support system. I couldn't imagine that

557
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,360
anything could happen in my life that

558
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,000
would instantly overnight make me hate

559
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,840
it. Uh, and it was very difficult and

560
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,240
very traumatic. Um, we would I would uh

561
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,480
go into a doctor's office and just pray

562
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,240
that they didn't call my name out loud

563
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,559
because I didn't want anyone to know who

564
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,600
I was.

565
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,799
Why' you stay? Why not leave? Why not

566
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,880
change your name, change your country? I

567
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,880
thought a lot about that. And then I

568
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,120
also realized that if I left, I would

569
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,279
still be the mother of a killer. I

570
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,559
wouldn't change anything. I can't hide

571
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:56,880
from this. And so I tried to embrace it

572
00:25:52,559 --> 00:26:01,279
and um learn from it and accept it and

573
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,320
see where this journey took me.

574
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,400
Coping with Coline put tremendous stress

575
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:10,760
on all your relationships, but perhaps

576
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,760
most importantly on your marriage.

577
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:16,799
I'd love to understand how you and your

578
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:21,360
husband coped or didn't. We each coped

579
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:24,480
in our own way. We grieve differently.

580
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,080
Um my tendency is to be more um

581
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,880
extroverted to seek out other fellow

582
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,559
survivors of loss to sort of get

583
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
shoulder-to-shoulder with people who

584
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,000
want to do something and and make a

585
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,600
difference. My husband is much more

586
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,480
introverted and I think my activity

587
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,400
level, my reaching out

588
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,400
um was difficult for him and I think his

589
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,480
withdrawal and his tendency to want a

590
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,760
quiet and peaceful life, not dealing

591
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,520
with this constantly was difficult for

592
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,640
me. And the way I sort of summarized

593
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,400
this, it was is sort of he's perceiving

594
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,400
me to be grieving incorrectly because

595
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,760
I'm wallowing in it. And I sort of

596
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,840
viewed that what he was doing was

597
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,520
incorrect because he was in denial. And

598
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,120
that was sort of neither that wasn't

599
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,960
really true for either of us. But that's

600
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,200
the way I think it sort of felt for both

601
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,520
of us. You described yourselves as being

602
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,440
on roller coasters. It was a roller

603
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,760
coaster, but different ones. Yes. We

604
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,640
were on two different rides. Yes. And we

605
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,960
were never in the same place at the same

606
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,480
time. And that was one of the difficult

607
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,799
things. when you're having a down day

608
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,039
and you feel sad, you want someone to

609
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,960
appreciate that sadness, give you the

610
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,360
space for that sadness and feel it with

611
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,039
you. Or, you know, it always seemed that

612
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,720
one of us would be sad, the other would

613
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:42,480
be angry or vice versa. And it it was

614
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,480
stressful to always try to find a

615
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,960
balance in this relationship when we

616
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,520
were just wildly fluctuating through all

617
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,600
kinds of emotions. So, the marriage did

618
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,760
not survive. That is correct. What does

619
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Tom think about what you're doing now

620
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,760
writing this book?

621
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,240
And I don't want to say what Tom is

622
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,640
thinking because I don't know what Tom

623
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,919
is thinking. I can only say that my

624
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,080
writing the book was difficult for him.

625
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,919
Early on, you and your husband differed

626
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,919
on how you wanted to address the

627
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,320
families that had lost loved ones at

628
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,240
Coline. You wanted to reach out and

629
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,960
write to them.

630
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,960
He felt the opposite.

631
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,840
How did you reconcile that? What what

632
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,840
did you want to say to them that was so

633
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,840
important?

634
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,880
I wanted to

635
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,480
acknowledge that to whatever degree it

636
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,039
was possible for me that I

637
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,039
recognized their agony and their sorrow

638
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,799
and to know let them know that I cared

639
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,760
about

640
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:50,399
that and to let them know that I am not

641
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,480
my son and to think of us both as two

642
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,880
beings with the same frame of mind, the

643
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,799
same personality, the same perceptions

644
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,919
was incorrect. direct um I wanted to do

645
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,919
whatever I could to connect with them. I

646
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,760
thought perhaps it might help certainly

647
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,559
you know when we look at victims and

648
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,679
victims advocacy sometimes it is helpful

649
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,240
for people to to come face to face with

650
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,919
with um perpetrators or their families

651
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,679
and I thought it might be helpful for

652
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,520
them. What kind of responses did you

653
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,880
get?

654
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:27,440
I got a very small response. Uh I did

655
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,840
get um over over time I I was um able to

656
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,480
meet two of the parents who did reach

657
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,960
out to me and wanted to

658
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,200
meet and I don't think I have ever felt

659
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,520
gratitude that deeply as I did to those

660
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,840
individuals who were brave enough and

661
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:46,159
kind enough to meet with me and quite a

662
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,480
few years later many years later I also

663
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:52,880
did re um meet another one of the

664
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,720
fathers but the meeting early on with

665
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,919
the with the two individuals who reached

666
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,600
out to me. It was a very tearful meeting

667
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,919
and um I know the mother that I met

668
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:06,960
first, the first thing she asked me was

669
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,880
who was Dylan? And I thought that was

670
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,279
the most beautiful gift anybody could

671
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,960
give

672
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:17,919
me to ask that question to not make the

673
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,720
assumption that he was just some evil

674
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,640
killer but that he was a boy and that he

675
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,039
was loved and that there was someone to

676
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,480
know

677
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:32,600
there and I will always be grateful to

678
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,600
her for for doing that.

679
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,720
Did you grieve for her child and the

680
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,360
others? Of

681
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:48,799
course. Of course I did. I didn't know

682
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,120
them, but I think of them always. I

683
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,880
still think of

684
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,559
them. They are always in my

685
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,120
mind. And to me, you know, the strongest

686
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,919
love that I can identify is the love

687
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,640
between a parent and a child.

688
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,960
and the thought that my son took that

689
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,080
away from

690
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,240
them. I felt so terrible and I continue

691
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,880
to feel terrible no matter what I do, no

692
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,799
matter how much I learn. That is

693
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,799
something that is very difficult to live

694
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,799
with.

695
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,600
Many say that you're the mother of a

696
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,600
killer. Yes.

697
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,320
Is that fair?

698
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,640
It is true. I don't know if it's fair or

699
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,080
not, but it's

700
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,960
true. It's something I've had to come to

701
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,600
grips

702
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,600
with. He was a killer.

703
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,840
Are you right not to have been involved

704
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,840
in his diary, not to have violated his

705
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,840
confidence? Cuz the answers were all

706
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,279
there right in front of you. I know.

707
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,720
Would you have to do it again? Would you

708
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,960
have read what Dylan was writing in

709
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,039
secret? Coming up next,

710
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Michael Strahan gets real about his

711
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,519
dad's healthcare that was a wakeup call

712
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,480
for him. It actually changed my life.

713
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,840
Plus, Shannon Dy's cancer crisis. How

714
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:21,559
she's fighting back. All new Oz. That's

715
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,559
coming up tomorrow.

720
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,960
Let's talk about Dylan's state of mind.

721
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,000
You make a note in the book that you

722
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,360
never wanted to read Dylan's

723
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,600
writings, his diary. He didn't feel it

724
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,200
was appropriate and you've seen it

725
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,799
written that we're not supposed to do

726
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,880
that, right? Were you right not to have

727
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,799
been involved in his diary, not to have

728
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,880
violated his confidence? Because the

729
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,399
answers were all there right in front of

730
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,200
you. I know if you could have just seen

731
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,000
what he was really thinking. Before this

732
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,679
happened to me, I would have said, "No,

733
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,399
that would be unethical to read a

734
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,320
child's diary." I would say to to a

735
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,640
parent

736
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,799
now, you search for anything you can,

737
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,200
but know the risks of doing that and be

738
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,679
prepared to discuss those risks and

739
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,320
discuss your concerns because the

740
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,880
message we're sending is I care about

741
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,640
you. I'm worried about you and I would

742
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,120
do anything I had to do to try to keep

743
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,200
you safe. If you have to do it again,

744
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,440
would you have read what Dylan was

745
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,360
writing in secret?

746
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,519
I certainly would have, but we have to

747
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,080
remember this was not a book. This were

748
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,799
pages stuck in school books or in a back

749
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,919
of a calendar. So it would it wasn't

750
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,679
just the simple fact of finding a book

751
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,200
somewhere and opening it. So you write

752
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:08,560
about your belief that that a brain

753
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,200
illness is not a hall pass. Yes. What do

754
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,359
you mean by that?

755
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,280
I don't want anyone to think that I'm

756
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,679
excusing what Dylan did like, oh, he

757
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,679
couldn't help it. he was sick. It's not

758
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,320
quite, you know, I understand that

759
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,119
that's kind of a ridiculous statement.

760
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,200
Um, that's what I meant by that. That

761
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,839
certainly whatever was in Dylan that

762
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,599
caused him to be violent, I'm sure there

763
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,320
were medical factors, but I'm sure there

764
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,240
were others as well. And as a mother, a

765
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,440
very important insight you offer is that

766
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,359
love is not enough. That is one of the

767
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,079
most important things I believe that I

768
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,760
learned from this entire

769
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,560
experience. that if someone does have a

770
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,560
brain illness, if someone is not well,

771
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,320
you can love them. You can tell them you

772
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,359
love them, you can believe that your

773
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,839
love is protective, but you can't always

774
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,760
you can't love away illness. If someone

775
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,160
is truly ill, they need help. They need

776
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,240
professional help. And I believed that

777
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,040
my love was protective. And I think

778
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,240
certainly when it comes to mental

779
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,240
illnesses especially, we tend to believe

780
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,560
that our loving them alone will fix

781
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,750
things and we'll make things right. And

782
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,889
it doesn't

783
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,889
[Music]

784
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:25,359
necessarily. It never occurred to me to

785
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,000
have any conversations about what's

786
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,880
going on in your head. I never had a

787
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,200
conversation like that with Dylan. I so

788
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,960
deeply regret that I did not. So, if

789
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Dylan was sitting in my seat right

790
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,220
now, what would you want him to hear?

791
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,590
Coming up next.

792
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,590
[Music]

793
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,909
[Music]

794
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:03,150
[Music]

795
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,920
Can we talk about the legacy of Coline?

796
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,640
Mhm. Yeah. As you struggle to make sense

797
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,440
of this, do you feel any

798
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:24,440
responsibility for these copycat school

799
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,440
shootings?

800
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,040
As a survivor of a child who died by

801
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,040
suicide, I feel

802
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,200
responsible in many ways for not saving

803
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,359
his

804
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:43,480
life. But I don't feel responsible for

805
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,920
um intensifying the level of

806
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,440
violence. And that's a difficult thing

807
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:52,560
again for some people to hear. But you

808
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,320
know, I did not raise my son to be a

809
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,760
violent person. and I did everything I

810
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,920
knew how to do

811
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,000
to keep him safe and happy and make him

812
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,760
a good

813
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,560
citizen.

814
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:10,960
Um, and I certainly have not um tried to

815
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,839
make the Coline incident something that

816
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,000
would be copied. You you write in the

817
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,240
book about Tom forcing the kids to get

818
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,560
dressed for church, about making sure

819
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,119
that, you know, he kept his room clean

820
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,560
or, you know, he was a good boy.

821
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,320
And yet you argue you point out that you

822
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,200
never monitored his brain health which

823
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,760
you say is the single biggest regret of

824
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,760
your life.

825
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,640
Absolutely. And again 17 years ago this

826
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,359
had not happened and I don't think

827
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,359
anything about depression was widely

828
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,920
known and teen depression. But if you

829
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,640
had monitored his brain health could you

830
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,280
have prevented the Coline shooting? I

831
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,079
believe that yes, I could have if I had

832
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:58,680
had the knowledge and the information

833
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:01,640
and the ability to see to somehow

834
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:04,400
capture the level of Dylan's

835
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,200
despair. Um, I certainly I don't know if

836
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,680
I could have prevented a shooting in

837
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,119
which Eric was involved, but I certainly

838
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,839
believe that Dylan would not have been

839
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,839
there that day to take part in it. So,

840
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:21,800
if Dylan was sitting in my seat right

841
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,800
now, what would you want him to hear?

842
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,640
I think I'd want him to

843
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:36,119
hear how I've used these last 17

844
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,800
years to say, "I'm sorry, I didn't

845
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:42,640
know." and to try to find whatever

846
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,640
answers I can and to share

847
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,880
them and to encourage people to realize

848
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,200
that what goes on behind the face is

849
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,119
very different from what you think

850
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,839
you're seeing. It can be very different

851
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,560
and to be very mindful of that. We teach

852
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,880
our children and I certainly did every

853
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,640
way to keep themselves safe. I mean I

854
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,280
what do we teach them? How to cross the

855
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,960
street? you know, don't drink and drive,

856
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,480
use condoms. I mean, just all these

857
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,720
things. And it never occurred to me to

858
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,640
have any conversations about what's

859
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,560
going on in your head, how do you

860
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,359
perceive life? Do you feel sometimes

861
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,960
that you'd rather not be

862
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:26,240
here? I never had a conversation like

863
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,800
that with Dylan. And I so deeply regret

864
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,880
that I did not. Do you think Dylan had

865
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,680
any idea how much he would hurt you? I

866
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,720
think he had no idea whatsoever. Dylan

867
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:42,440
had no idea what this would do to to so

868
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,440
many of us. I don't think he did.

869
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,989
[Music]

870
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,160
Charlie is back. There were some reports

871
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,839
that you sent angry texts made some

872
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,760
comments that were a little alarming for

873
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,440
me to hear. Is he ready to face his

874
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,280
truth? According to Denise, you said,

875
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,440
"I'm going to kill you and I'm going to

876
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,480
kill your mom." I'm concerned as a

877
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,680
father and a husband. All new Oz.

878
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,960
That's coming up next

879
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,280
week. Sue has compiled a list of

880
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
resources about teen suicide prevention,

881
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,880
bullying, and many other topics. They're

882
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,240
all in her book, A Mother's Reckoning.

883
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,400
You can also find them on

884
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:23,440
dr.com. So, if you decide to never speak

885
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,520
about this tragedy ever again, what

886
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,359
would you want everyone in America to

887
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,359
know, to take away from this

888
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,359
conversation?

889
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,320
I think I'd want people to

890
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:43,000
understand the importance of not always

891
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:46,640
trusting what you see and the need

892
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,400
to always look behind the surface to

893
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,000
make the assumption that there is a need

894
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,520
to look behind the surface even when

895
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,280
there isn't. The chance that one's child

896
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,119
or family member would become a mass

897
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,760
shooter is very very small. It's

898
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,520
probably one in millions. But the

899
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,440
chances that someone you love might be

900
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,760
struggling with thoughts of suicide and

901
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,000
might be planning their own death,

902
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,079
there's a much much higher danger of

903
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,359
that. And I think I want to raise

904
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,319
awareness about that for people to know

905
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,680
that suicide is the uh second leading

906
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:22,000
cause of death for youth and we have to

907
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,880
open our eyes and do something about

908
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,200
this. Do you think you're a good mother

909
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,520
to Dylan?

910
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,079
I'm sure it sounds ridiculous for me to

911
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,319
say yes, but I did believe I was a good

912
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:38,839
mother. And I believe where I failed him

913
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:44,400
was in all the ways that we've discussed

914
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:48,480
today, of not knowing how to communicate

915
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,760
in a way that would draw him out, um, of

916
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,839
trusting in his goodness and his

917
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,760
healthiness.

918
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:57,640
But I believed I was the best mother I

919
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,119
knew how to

920
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:05,280
be. And I believe for the most part I

921
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,280
was a good mom. I sure tried hard to

922
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:21,560
[Music]

923
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,560
be Heat. Heat.

924
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:42,450
[Applause]

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:42,450

00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,580
