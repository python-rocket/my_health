1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,560
Pick it, push it, pop it. What really

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,880
lies beneath? Dr. Pimple Popper is here

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,320
with her most frightening case yet.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,200
They're scared to find something out

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,679
like that. And Suzanne Summers up close

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,320
and very personal. Her Instagram pick

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,640
that started a firestorm. Plus, the

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,880
filthiest humidifier in America. You

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,119
have to see to believe. I'm terrified

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,119
and repulsed at the same time. Coming up

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,119
next.

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:35,440
[Music]

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,440
Are you ready for season

14
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:51,909
[Applause]

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,520
11? Today you're in for a treat and a

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,079
big one. She's one of my all-time

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,160
favorite guests, has nearly 6 million

18
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,479
subscribers on YouTube, and has been

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,640
restoring her patients confidence while

20
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,560
grossing out fans for years. She took

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,840
the internet by storm when she started

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,360
posting videos popping

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,880
pimples. Now, years later, these videos

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,119
have gathered over 3.5 billion with a B

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,439
billion views worldwide. Check it out.

26
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:26,680
Oh my. Please welcome the popular pimple

27
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,680
popper, Dr. Sandra Lee. Come on out.

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:35,520
[Applause]

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
Hello, darling.

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,680
Nice to see you. You look wonderful.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,400
Thank you. Thanks. Oh my goodness. Here

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
in person. Yes. No pimples, though. I

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,960
didn't bring any with me. Yeah. You're

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,119
not wearing any today. You know, people

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,600
cannot look away, not just from you, but

36
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,240
from these cases, you What is so

37
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,439
universally mesmerizing about your work?

38
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,360
Well, I think it starts with a little

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,200
fascination, you know, with what we do

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,799
as physicians, but there's something

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
cathartic about it. I mean, there's

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,640
something about removing something that

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,079
is not supposed to be there and putting

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
everything back in this place. And I

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,600
think that's really why people keep

46
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,360
coming back to it. A little bit of OCD

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,840
in all of us, isn't there? Yes, it Yes,

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
there is. It makes you feel good and

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
that's what's so wonderful about it. I

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,599
actually think women and men are a

51
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,440
little different because in my family,

52
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,120
the women groom all the time. Yeah. So,

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,120
if they see something on me, they I can

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,040
see my wife go like this, just staring

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,959
at my forehead. It is definitely more of

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,640
a woman thing, too. They'll chase you

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,239
around the house, pin you down, that

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,520
sort of things. Yes. All right. So,

59
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
today we're checking out some of Dr.

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,360
Lee's most frightening cases yet. I'm a

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,959
spoiler alert here. These are a lot

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
worse than your average pimple. You all

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,920
ready for this?

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,879
I knew I knew you would be. Take a look.

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,120
That That's jaw-dropping. Yeah. So, he

66
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,680
has a case of rhinopa, a very serious

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,280
case. This is a form of rosacea to all

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,040
the people who have rosacea. It does not

69
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,920
mean that you're going to get rhopya. It

70
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,000
happens more in men uh people who are

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
fair complexed. It happens primarily on

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,720
the nose and you get this really

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
thickening of the nose, the skin of the

74
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,040
nose. It's really oily. What causes it?

75
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,480
I I we don't actually know what causes

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,680
rosacea because people in my family have

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,440
it. It's that redness of the cheeks.

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
Similar. Yeah. Santa Claus redness.

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,480
Exactly. And I want I really want to say

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,159
that's really what's really important

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,800
about this. It's not caused by

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,680
alcoholism. A lot of people think that

83
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,400
and that's not fair. It it definitely

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
rosacea and rhopya are triggered or

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,040
worsened by alcohol. There's certain

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,040
triggering factors. Alcohol, caffeine,

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,720
stress, sunlight, all the kind of things

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,840
that you know probably make us enjoy

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,440
life, right? You know, uh but it is not

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,040
does not mean if you have rhinopa that

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,720
you're an alcoholic. But what is the

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,879
cause then? Do we believe? Uh it's just

93
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,480
an overgrowth of tissue. It's a form of

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,840
rhinopima that just causes this

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,920
thickening and it's not um it's not a

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,640
medical necessity to remove it, but it

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,400
is certainly obviously it is not it's

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,239
cosmetically disfiguring. I thought we

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
had little mites on our do we all have

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,680
I'm sorry I forgot to ask I'm fascinated

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,200
by this and I because I I see it in my

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,720
family. I've looked into it. We all have

103
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,159
these little mites, little bugs on us,

104
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,239
right? Right. This is something that

105
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,840
kind of freaks people out because there

106
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
are mites that live on our skin normally

107
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,159
like little caterpillars and they kind

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,200
like that. Yes. And we we do find that

109
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,959
people with rosacea and rhinopa have a

110
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,479
higher concentration of these mites on

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,320
our face. But we all have them. They're

112
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,400
all watching us. They're all on us right

113
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,759
now. So, you know, they're like they

114
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,360
when you see them under electron

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
microscope, they're really kind of cute.

116
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
But I'm sure people most most people

117
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,560
don't think they look cute, but I do.

118
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,320
And they live on our they live on our

119
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
face and they live along with us. But

120
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,720
with people with this condition, we do

121
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,440
find an increased amount of them. So we

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
have tried to target um treatment you

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,639
know at you know trying to destroy some

124
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
of these. But in the meantime how how do

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
you treat it? Where do you even start?

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,840
You need your nose. Yes. Yes. Well this

127
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,600
is an extra part of your nose. He

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,360
obviously has too much nose and it's

129
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,479
actually you know affecting his ability

130
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,880
to breathe. So you actually we use a

131
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,639
device. It's called a loop cottery or a

132
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,720
loop electro surgery. It's a lot like

133
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,639
what you use in surgery a boi that you

134
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,800
cut and cauterize at the same time. And

135
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,639
we use it like a hot knife through

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,639
butter. I mean, it's essentially it's so

137
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,680
hot that it will just make a cut through

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,680
it and it's bloodless. It's very

139
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,039
satisfying, but you have to be careful

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,320
because obviously if you take off too

141
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,320
much, you can't put it back. This is

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,360
after this. Yeah, this is another Yes,

143
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,720
this is another patient we I did their

144
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,440
rhinopma. Uh, so we see a lot of

145
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,840
patients with it and it's just so

146
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,320
satisfying to do because it's such it is

147
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,240
something that can transform somebody so

148
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
quickly and you know, they're so

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
thankful for it. It's just really a

150
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,600
wonderful um treatment to be able to do,

151
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
you know. I'm really proud of it. You

152
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
should be and you're back to life again.

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
People are staring at you. I mean, you

154
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,039
can't. How do you hide your nose? You

155
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
can't. You can't. Anything that you do,

156
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,759
people are going to look at you and look

157
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,280
directly at your nose. So, you can't

158
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
hide it. Now, it's easy to think that

159
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,880
Dr. Lee only focuses on humps and bumps

160
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,080
and lumps. But when you're in her line

161
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,440
of work, there's no telling what might

162
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,919
come through the door next. Take a look

163
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,280
at this case. Oh, Maya is terrifying.

164
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,560
Yeah. You know, psoriasis is really

165
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,280
common. We see it actually in

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,759
celebrities, too. Kim Kardashian has is

167
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,160
told the world. Yeah. It affects one out

168
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,919
of a hundred people. Um it is not

169
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,319
life-threatening, but it's a chronic

170
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,000
skin condition. It's lifelong. And so

171
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,919
how bad does it get from different to

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
have 90% of your body covered? People

173
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,360
can have just one little spot on their

174
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,560
elbow or on their scalp or they can have

175
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,199
90 100% of their body involved. And so

176
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,440
it it also um causes arthritis which is

177
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,120
really common. So there are a range of

178
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,560
treatment options really if you have

179
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,319
mild condition. Yeah. I was going to say

180
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
that is that you get arthritis because

181
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,280
the same thing on your skin is happening

182
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,800
in your joint. Yes. Yeah. Essentially,

183
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,560
we think, you know, we don't really know

184
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
exactly what it is, but we do know it

185
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,840
has something to do with an overactive

186
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,919
immune system because we do find certain

187
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,240
treatment options that are targeting

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
that help, right? So, um you know, we

189
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,440
use topical steroids, which is really

190
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,360
common because that helps to blunt the

191
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,280
immune system, but now we have all these

192
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,960
biologics which are amazing. They've

193
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,360
really transformed dermatology and

194
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,639
rheumatology and medicine. So, one shot

195
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,840
once a month or something. Yes. Yeah.

196
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,280
Once a month. Depends on the medication

197
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,199
that you use and it can really it

198
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,199
cleared this guy up essentially in about

199
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,520
a month or so. He recovered from that.

200
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,720
Yes. Yeah. It's so amazing. Amazing the

201
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,319
things that you can do now. It really

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,080
makes me happy to be a dermatologist

203
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,479
that we have these things now that can

204
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,080
that can really help to change people.

205
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,240
What was his emotional response when he

206
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,440
no longer had continuous pain? Well, the

207
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,840
emotional response is that you the pain

208
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,440
but also the fact that now he feels like

209
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,599
he can interact with his kid. I think

210
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,599
the big deal was that he he could go to

211
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,440
parties with him. he can work. You know,

212
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,880
before it was so painful it it was

213
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,520
difficult for him to work and you're

214
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,080
embarrassed because your your wife is

215
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,680
his wife had to follow after him and

216
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,560
clean up all this scale. You know,

217
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,720
imagine you have so much skin in your

218
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,639
house in your bathtub. You take a bath

219
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,240
and it's stuck in your drain. All these

220
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,000
sorts of thing that just affect your

221
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,199
daily living. God bless you for helping

222
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,199
him. All right, up next, one of the

223
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
strangest cases Dr. Lee has ever

224
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,280
encountered. We just showed you a couple

225
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,479
strange ones. This Yeah, there it is.

226
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,240
We're going to show you the surgery

227
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,380
required to fix this right here in

228
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,319
studio. Be right back.

229
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,160
[Music]

230
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,639
Coming up, the most frightening cases

231
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,360
Dr. Pimple Popper has ever seen,

232
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,440
including one like this. Yes, you won't

233
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,080
believe how big cases like this one can

234
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,080
get. Is

235
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,120
next. Do you need a health reboot?

236
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,199
Something you can stick with. We have an

237
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,639

because we made it easy. From the way

you manage your stress every day. System

244
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,599
20 for 2020. It feels good.

245
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,880
We're back with Dr. Pimple Papa herself,

246
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,320
the adorable Dr. Sandra Lee. Now, we've

247
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,040
been talking about the most frightening

248
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,959
cases Dr. Lee has ever seen. And this

249
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,600
one might just take the cake. Take a

250
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,680
look. What is going on here? Well, that

251
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,920
that's a lipoma, but it is the biggest

252
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,640
lipoma I've ever seen. And of course,

253
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,200
we're doing it on this show. It is it it

254
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,360
is the it is bigger than a baby. It

255
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,000
would be a record making baby, really.

256
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,920
12 lbs 9 oz. That That's crazy. Yes. We

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,839
take a step back here. You all saw that,

258
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,760
right? Right. Whenever you walk around

259
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,320
with a 12 pound mass in your back like

260
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,000
that, I hope not. What is going Why do

261
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,240
people not go seek care? Why don't they

262
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,839
address the issues? You know, I I I try

263
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
not to blame the patients certainly

264
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,040
because you know what happens? You

265
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,720
there's money involved. They don't have

266
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,800
the money. They have to work. They have

267
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,640
to, you know, raise a family and have

268
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,880
have a have a life that they can't get

269
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,279
away from. They're scared of doctors.

270
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,800
insurance won't pay for it. Um, and

271
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,720
these are really things that's not

272
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,000
life-threatening. A lipoma is a benign

273
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
growth. And other doctors might see it

274
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,440
and say, you know what, you don't have

275
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,120
to remove that. It's not medically

276
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,640
necessary. But there is also the fear

277
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,080
that it's not just a lipoma. There could

278
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,600
be become a cancer, right? They do

279
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,200
become cancer sometimes. Yes, they they

280
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,440
can. They certainly can. But something

281
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,279
that grows this long under the skin for

282
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,839
years and hasn't threatened your life

283
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,440
yet, unlikely. But yeah, at any moment,

284
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
anything can turn. So, what made it so

285
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,120
difficult to remove? The size of it, of

286
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,360
course. And you know, also this

287
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
gentleman, he's so sweet and kind, but

288
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
you know, it's hard. You know what? I I

289
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,000
do things under local anesthesia, so I

290
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,279
have to manage a lot of different things

291
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,040
at the same time. I got to talk to the

292
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,480
patient, make sure they're comfortable,

293
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,240
make sure that I can get this out, make

294
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,839
sure it's not, you know, bleeding, make

295
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,360
sure. So, there's a lot of things going

296
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,399
on in my mind. All right. So, we

297
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,640
constructed a massive replica. Actually,

298
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,720
it's about the same size as the lipoma.

299
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
So, not so massive. Big, you mean a real

300
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,959
life replica. Walk us through the

301
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
procedure. Literally, what did you do?

302
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,680
Yes. So this is essentially this is his

303
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,360
back and we take a big blade. Oh yeah, I

304
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,360
got to put my gloves on for this. This

305
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
is a replica. Yes, that's right. So you

306
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,200
have to make an incision that's along

307
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,120
the lines of the skin so that it heals

308
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
correctly. So it's horizontal or

309
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
vertical. Um usually in this case it

310
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,880
might be a little bit diagonal even

311
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,399
because I want to go along skin tension

312
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,240
lines, resting skin tension lines to

313
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,920
hide it as much as I can. And I make a

314
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,480
smaller incision always because I'm

315
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,399
trying to minimize it and also pop it

316
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,560
out in as small a hole as possible. And

317
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
I use my hands for this. Really, not

318
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,680
really blades as as little as possible

319
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
because obviously um your fingers are

320
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,839
blunt and you'll be able to dissect this

321
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,800
lip palm out. So, oh my goodness. A look

322
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,120
at that. So, here it is. It's always a

323
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,880
little hard. It's It's stuffed in there.

324
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,399
So, I use my hands to kind of undermine

325
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,800
what we call undermining, right? And I

326
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,320
pull it out. You I know you want to

327
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,320
help. I want to help. Don't y'all want

328
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,480
to get in here? That's exactly like what

329
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,640
what it was like. So, um, like

330
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,360
delivering a big at the end, that pop at

331
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,959
the end is Oh. And then there's usually

332
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,800
connective tissue. This is like fibrous

333
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,480
connective tissue or scar tissue. Yes.

334
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,480
If you could help me out. We usually

335
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
just trim it. I make sure there's no I'm

336
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,800
very careful about bleeding and making

337
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,640
sure we we stop that because obviously

338
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,760
we don't want this little red

339
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,959
cauterized. Yep. And then Oh, and there

340
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,959
we go. There it is.

341
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,040
Place it on. How good does that feel?

342
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,320
Yes, it feels good. That felt good. Did

343
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,399
you let me close this? Did the surgical

344
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,839
team applaud? I applaud in my mind

345
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,200
actually. How when you've helped

346
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,320
patients and we've you've shown us a

347
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
couple today that you really have

348
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,000
changed our lives. What does that do to

349
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,519
you? How does it change you? I mean it

350
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,600
feels wonderful. This is the biggest

351
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,680
gift that this show has given me. The

352
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,279
fact that I can actually see, you know,

353
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,600
you do so many things too on a daily

354
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,279
basis, but I actually get to see how it

355
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,519

368
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,279
Coming up, the wonderful Suzanne Summers

369
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,200
is here revealing her new way to age.

370
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,800
Yep. I'm sharing what I eat and what I

371
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
use to feel younger and more vibrant

372
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,360
than ever. And it's really cool. There's

373
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,360
the evidence.

374
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,920
[Applause]

375
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,959
You may know her as Chrissy from Thre's

376
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,120
Company or Carol from Stepbystep, but

377
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,120
Suzanne Summers has made a new name for

378
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,680
herself as one of the most outspoken

379
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,600
health advocates who isn't afraid to

380
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,519
bear it all. Suzanne recently made

381
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,360
headlines after this photo created a

382
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:37,440
firestorm across the country. You see

383
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,760
why? At 73 years of age, actually 73

384
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,600
years young, Den is here to reveal the

385
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,639
truth behind that picture. Oh, I love

386
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,800
having you here. I love

387
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
looks so good, too. I know. She knows

388
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,600
all about aging. She's going to reveal

389
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,959
some of the anti-aging secrets as well.

390
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,720
But can I just first start? Everyone was

391
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,399
buzzing about that photo. What's the

392
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,399
backtory? The caption, by the way, was

393
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:01,199
here. I am at 73 in my birthday suit.

394
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,880
And that's just a tribute to you. you to

395
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,480
look so vital to feel so good but in

396
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,920
addition to have recovered from breast

397
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,279
cancer yet they were critics what do you

398
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,880
have to say to them people didn't like

399
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,480
the fact that you posted that I know

400
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,440
wonder I wonder why you know my whole

401
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,480
thing for for women and men and what I'm

402
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,000
realizing is that I'm enjoying aging and

403
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,519
you can't lie about your age anyway

404
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,399
because there's a thing called Google

405
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,639
yes but I just want you to know girls it

406
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,560
ain't

407
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:32,399
over it ain't

408
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:36,000
over and so I thought when I was 73 I'd

409
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,040
be old and chronologically I'm old in in

410
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,600
society, but I'm not old. I don't. I

411
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,160
have energy and I do have a a a

412
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,160
fractured hip right now, but um that

413
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,760
slows me down a little bit, but that's

414
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,680
just from all that sex Allen and I are

415
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,959
having. Allan Allen that Allan Hamilton

416
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
actually the interesting thing about

417
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,680
Suzanne, I may brag on you. If if you

418
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,279
know folks in Hollywood, you know

419
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,120
Suzanne's reputation there. I mean,

420
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,560
everybody is coming to you for secrets

421
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,839
on how to stay young. You're kind to

422
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,040
come on the show and share it with all

423
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,240
of America. So, as just as an example,

424
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,279
this is a recent photo. It's on social

425
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,760
media. Everyone can pull it down. This

426
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,279
is you and Courtney Cox, Jen Aston, Lord

427
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,639
Dur. I mean, there some superstars

428
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,920
there, right? How'd you guys become

429
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,440
friends, by the Well, Courtney lives

430
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,839
right up the street from me and um all

431
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:26,160
those girls um have been looking to me

432
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,600
um for aging tips because I know I know

433
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,839
what they're going through right now.

434
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,120
It's just beginning. It's the decline of

435
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,279
hormones. And you and I have talked

436
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,440
about this a lot. And I started writing

437
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,480
about bioidentical hormones. I don't

438
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,160
know, this is my 27th book, so maybe 10

439
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,199
or 15 books ago. was called a new a new

440
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,880
way to age with a spectacular again

441
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:49,120
effort to educate us. Thank you. Well,

442
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,639
well, there is a new way to age and when

443
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,160
you look at the present paradigm of

444
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,000
aging, it's something none of us want.

445
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,160
It's decrepit. It's frail. It's one of

446
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,639
the big three, cancer, heart disease,

447
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,279
Alzheimer's, with the eventual end point

448
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,800
being the nursing home. And so, if you

449
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,440
don't want that, you have to start

450
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,959
making the right choices now. And what

451
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,600
I've realized in writing all these

452
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,440
books, it's been such a privilege, is

453
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,360
that if you listen to the language of

454
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,399
your body, you know, I joke about

455
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,079
menopause, it's it's [ __ ] sleepy,

456
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,120
sweaty, bloated, forgetful, and all

457
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,800
dried up. You know, what a poem. You

458
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,399
know that. Oh my goodness. Right. But

459
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,519
that's the language. When you're itchy,

460
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,440
when you're sweaty, when you can't

461
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,680
sleep, the body's talking, saying, "I'm

462
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,920
missing something." And so that's when I

463
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,240
got into putting back through lab work

464
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,839
these natural hormones in exactly what

465
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,160
you need individualized. So that's how

466
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,639
you take care of that part of aging. So

467
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,440
let me ask you is because you're a

468
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,759
walking testimonial to what you're doing

469
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,519
so my talk. Yeah. Well, so when you are

470
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,920
with these superstars for example who

471
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,440
are going through life a generation

472
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,040
behind you, are they taking your advice?

473
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,720
Do they take biioidentical hormones? Are

474
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,880
they doing the things you recommend?

475
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,800
They they uh they're doing it. Look at

476
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,560
them. Don't they look good? They look

477
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,480
good. I mean, I don't take credit for

478
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,280
them, but um they were they they were

479
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,240
interest they Courtney and Jennifer

480
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,160
sought me out and I I saw them in a

481
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,120
restaurant one night many years ago and

482
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,959
and we want to talk to you and I when

483
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,280
women say that to me, I know what it is.

484
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,839
And um it allows you to stay of life

485
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,039
rather than out of it. It allows you to

486
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,720
keep your juice in the best way. And not

487
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,160
only for women, but for men. I mean, I

488
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,360
look at my husband who's 83. He he looks

489
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,919
so amazing, really. And um I think we

490
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,200
have to rethink it. I' I'd really like

491
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:44,400
to live well into my hundreds as long as

492
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,559
I keep my brain. One of the reasons that

493
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,039
age is so valued in human society is

494
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,480
because it brings wisdom. And as you

495
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,600
look back on your career, and I showed

496
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,320
the picture of you and Thre's company

497
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:59,679
earlier, television's changed a lot. And

498
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,440
so if if you reflect back with me if

499
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,200
perhaps share what you share with those

500
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,880
stars that you've been mentoring on

501
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,600
their health, how has the industry of

502
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,200
television changed? Well, if you had to

503
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,640
if you were in television when I was in

504
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,280
that was probably the best time to ever

505
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,960
be in television unless you find a a a

506
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,400
niche like you have found. You have

507
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,720
found something only you can do. Um but

508
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,720
at that time there were only three

509
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,400
networks and um I was on the number one

510
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,720
show and so if you're watching

511
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
television on Tuesday night probably

512
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,240
half the country or a little more than

513
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,440
that was watching Thre's Company. Oh my

514
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,840
goodness. So it was a very powerful

515
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:40,640
thing. Um and I love doing that show. I

516
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:43,360
was fired because um I I my contract was

517
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,360
up and I went to renegotiate and all the

518
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,280
men are making 10 to 15 times more than

519
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,039
me and I'm on the number one show. I

520
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,799
thought are they all 15 times better

521
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,400
than me? So when I went in to

522
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,640
renegotiate they had already decided

523
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,120
that they were going to u fire me so

524
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,720
that women would stop asking. That was

525
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,080
before the me too movement. If it

526
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,120
happened today I would own ABC. Oh gosh.

527
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,799
Oh my goodness. Is that right? But

528
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,120
here's the good thing. I think in every

529
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,400
you have to find the silver lining in

530
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,799
everything. So now I'm fired and I'm

531
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,120
sitting at home. I had been on top of

532
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,679
the world. I'm sitting at home and

533
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,600
thinking why why did I do why wasn't I

534
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,600
happy? And then I hear a voice. I hear

535
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,440
voices and it said why are you focused

536
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,960
on what you don't have? Why don't you

537
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,160
focus on what you do have? Now I'm

538
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,840
talking to the voice. I go what do I

539
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,080
have? You have enormous visibility.

540
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,320
Everybody knows your name. And it hit me

541
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,320
like wow. Wow. Well, what an advantage

542
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,480
that is. So, I said to Allan, "I'd like

543
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,919
to do a Las Vegas nightclub act." So, we

544
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,480
went, and it's a long story, but he made

545
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,480
a two-year deal at the MGM Grand. And in

546
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,160
' 87, I was named female entertainer of

547
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,880
the year along with Frank Sinatra. Oh

548
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,720
gosh. And then I had nothing to do dur

549
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,320
during the day. So, I started writing

550
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,280
books. So, I wasn't ordering room

551
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,559
service and and um watching soap operas.

552
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
And then the book started becoming

553
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,120
bestsellers. And then I started

554
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,200
educating myself. And um I was

555
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,320
introduced on one show as Autodactic.

556
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,200
And I had to go look up what

557
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,919
autodidactic was. And a lot of great

558
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,880
contributions have been made by

559
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,280
autodidactics. It's usually people like

560
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,600
myself who are not educated. And I

561
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,840
learned everything that I'm capable of

562
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,320
learning and continue to learn. And so

563
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,000
my scope is narrow. But I now lecture to

564
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,640
doctors. I was just asked to lecture to

565
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,679
7,000 doctors in S. Paulo, Brazil. and

566
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:36,159
and I don't walk out insecure because I

567
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:40,000
understand this part of of aging and I

568
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:42,559
am experiencing an incredible quality of

569
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,280
life. I sleep eight hours every night

570
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,440
without any drugs. That's a big deal.

571
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,760
That's a big

572
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,600
deal. I u I have a sex drive which

573
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,200
normally at my age that starts waning.

574
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,000
You know, when you don't have sex

575
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,840
hormones, estrogen, progesterone,

576
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,840
testosterone, we women can't feel sex.

577
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,679
So, it's not like we've lost interest.

578
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,080
We can't feel it. So, when you put back

579
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,640
these sex hormones, woohoo, you start

580
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,520
feeling stuff again. And you look at

581
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,720
people differently, right? I want to

582
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,320

586
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,960
think. Stick around.

beautiful Suzanne Summers and her new

made it your mission to help people feel

608
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,120
younger at any age. And I want to if I

609
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,159
can I'm going to take you through a

610
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,520
couple tips everybody. These are all

611
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,120
Suzanne's ideas. The first one has to do

612
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,280
with the skin. When I look at you and

613
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,039
you pointed this out there, the actual

614
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,280
texture of the skin looks fabulous. And

615
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,720
your skin is is your external barometer

616
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,960
of what's going on inside your body,

617
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,799
right? How do you do it? So if you look

618
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,880
at skin, which you have under a

619
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,520
microscope, these pores look like big

620
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,039
holes. Now imagine you're putting There

621
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,679
it is. There's your pores. Okay. So now

622
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,960
you're putting chemical cream over those

623
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,320
holes. Where do you think it's going to

624
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,720
end up? is going to drop into your

625
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,960
bloodstream. Yeah. Your your skin does

626
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,840
matter. And to your point, what you put

627
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,600
on it, minimal toxins, moisturiz, let me

628
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,280
transition to the gut because there are

629
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,480
tips you provide to us about the gut

630
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,240
that are important because it's not just

631
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,679
about avoiding toxins. It's also about

632
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,720
feeding the bacteria the right things.

633
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,120
Totally. So, I've given you a couple

634
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,520
examples of probiotics. I got yogurt,

635
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,679
sauerkraut, kimchi. Are these commonly

636
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,840
ingested in your family? Yes. In

637
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,080
particular, I crave sour I crave

638
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,840
sauerkraut. I don't know why. I'm Irish

639
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,600
and didn't come from Ireland. I'm

640
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,600
married to a Polish guy, so maybe it's

641
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,520
something in there. And if I only took

642
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,039
one supplement every day, I think I take

643
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,159
a lot, but if I only took one, I would

644
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,520
take a probiotic because everybody's

645
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,080
everybody's got something wrong with

646
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,200
their gut, right? I in the who who here

647
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,280
just raise your hand. You got got

648
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,960
bloating, you bloat, you got things.

649
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,559
Yeah, look at everybody. It's

650
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,799
something's wrong because it's the

651
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,559
environment. And so the one thing you

652
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,679
could do for your gut that would be the

653
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,000
best thing you could do is take a

654
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,559
probiotic every day. And then to make it

655
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,120
work better, eat either take a prebiotic

656
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,200
or eat sauerkraut. I make sauerkraut.

657
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,640
It's fun to make. Everything's fun to do

658
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,360
with you. All right. I'm going to leave

659
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,240
it with a last tip, a surprising new way

660
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,840
as a health secret to slow your AC down.

661
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,799
I'm going to raise our glass to this

662
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,919
idea. What is this, Ann? Take it away.

663
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,919
Well, when I got mold in my GI tract, I

664
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,520
couldn't eat any sugar or yeast, so I

665
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,880
couldn't have wine. And my kids said,

666
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,159
"Drink tequila." I said, "I don't drink

667
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,840
hard liquor." Because my father was an

668
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:16,720
alcoholic. Oh, try it. I liked

669
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:19,039
it. And it's kind of um psychedelic. And

670
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,440
and Allan and I, we have a bar at our

671
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,679
house. We call it Big Al's Bar. And one

672
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,039
night he buzzes my office at the end of

673
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,960
the day. He goes, "You want a date?" And

674
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,640
I said, "Yeah." He said, "Let's meet at

675
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,080
Big Al's Bar." We went down to Big Al's

676
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,919
Bar. He poured me a stiff tequila. Uh we

677
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,200
listened to music. We talked. We ended

678
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,120
up dancing. And then we started dating

679
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,960
two, three times a week. And now we date

680
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,440
almost every night. Let's bring Alan

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,320
acid can do for you is Dr. Rosio Rivera

709
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,400
here on behalf of my trusted sponsorship

710
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,799
partner, L'Oreal Paris. I love having

711
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,320
you here. Thank you. So, glycolic acid,

712
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,480
something people may have heard of, but

713
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,559
define it if you can. And why is it a

714
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,120
dermatologist go-to ingredient? Well, as

715
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,440
a scientist, Dr. O, it is my job to make

716
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,080
sure I research the best and most

717
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,480
effective ingredients in skin care. You

718
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,039
know, it's glycolic acid is one of those

719
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,120
and it's been one of those u superpower

720
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,279
ingredients used by dermatologist. They

721
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,520
swear by for years, but it's not always

722
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,360
been available to everyone, especially

723
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,120
in its pure form. But let me tell you

724
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,120
what glycolic acid does, please. You

725
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,520
know, it resurfaces your skin from the

726
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,919
inside out, which translates into fewer

727
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,559
dark spots, more even skin tone, and my

728
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,159
favorite, less wrinkles and fine lines.

729
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,159
But we don't always have the luxury of

730
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,159
time to go to the dermatologist. Right.

731
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,840
So, at L'Oreal Paris, we developed the

732
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,520
first 10% pure glycolic acid serum. That

733
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,600
is the highest concentration that you

734
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,840
can use at home, but it's gentle enough

735
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,960
to use on every day on your skin. So you

736
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,400
can get what a dermatage would have

737
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,080
given you in past years at home. All

738
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,000
right, come on over here. Dr. Rivera is

739
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,000
going to help all of us understand a bit

740
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,400
more about why experts believe glycolic

741
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,240
acid is so important for this skin. So

742
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,760
we built you skin. This what it looks

743
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,200
like, right? And we're just going to

744
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,799
pretend the surface of the skin has some

745
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,320
blemishes on it, some wrinkles, some

746
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,679
aging spots. Look at that. Right? So

747
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,279
when you take glycolic acid, you can be

748
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,960
the glycolic acid administrator. You can

749
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,640
be the dermatologist today. Pretend.

750
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,880
Right? When you put the glycolic acid on

751
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,720
your skin, it acts to dissolve the glue

752
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,000
between your dead skin cells. gets the

753
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,159
hyperpigmentation which in turns look at

754
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,559
that it reveals even skin tone from

755
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,600
underneath you see these dark spots it

756
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,039
also gets rid of them just with time but

757
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,480
there's something else happening right

758
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,960
there is the thing I like about this

759
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,720
though is even skin tone you do this you

760
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,320
dissolve some of these these linkages

761
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,039
you allow your skin to do what it

762
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,080
naturally wants to do but the key is to

763
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,679
fix the stuff inside the skin and on top

764
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,120
so if I turn this around you'll see

765
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,279
something very important you see those

766
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,919
cells as we get older they start to not

767
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,320
look so robust. Yes. But with glycolic

768
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,559
acid, what's going on with 10% pure

769
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,840
glycolic acid, what happens is it

770
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,600
activates reactivates new skin cells.

771
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,440
This is what we're looking at. Which in

772
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,200
turns reduces the wrinkles on the

773
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,600
surface like we just saw. And these are

774
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,360
the new cells from I'll share with you

775
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,120
my All right. So, are you all clear on

776
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,399
this? This is the theory of why it

777
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
works. All right. So, what do you

778
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,000
recommend if someone wants to achieve

779
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,480
the benefits that we just saw? Well, I

780
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,640
recommend L'Oreal's Revital Derm

781
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,360
Intensives glycolic acid serum. It has

782
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,440
10% chloric acid like we just said, but

783
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,360
it was formulated specifically to do

784
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,679
those three things we just saw, dark

785
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,159
spots, uneven skin tone and wrinkles.

786
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,640
So, ladies, be consistent because if you

787
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,720
do, you'll see fast and very effective

788
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,840
results. Can we take one second here? A

789
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,440
lot of viewers are going to hear the

790
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,320
word acid. Yes. And not surprising,

791
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,080
you're going to think, well, do I want

792
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,679
to put acid on my skin? Right. But

793
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,880
glycolic acid, I know, I mean, as a

794
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,159
heart surgeon, I know that it's one of

795
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,760
the foundations of dermatologic

796
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,720
treatment. Get folks comfortable with

797
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,320
what it does. Yes. So acid can be scary,

798
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,240
but make sure you know the glycolic acid

799
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,640
you're using, the purity, the

800
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,559
percentage, but most importantly, Dr.

801
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,760
Oz, is it backed by dermatologist? This

802
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,520
is why at Lauria Paris, we created a 10%

803
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,880
pure glycolic acid, the highest

804
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,960
concentration that you could use at

805
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,880
home. That's also be backed by

806
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,799
dermatologist. We had external panel of

807
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,360
dermatologist go through the entire

808
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,919
process and looked at our formulas and

809
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,799
we went farther. We wanted to make sure

810
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,640
everyone can use this every day. So we

811
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,880
added and formulated with soothing and

812
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,600
hydrating ingredients like aloe vera.

813
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,000
Therefore it's ultra gentle on the skin

814
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
yet extremely effective. So let me just

815
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,279
tell you something. No one has to be

816
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,200
scared of this glycolic acid. All right.

817
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,520
So the revital derm intensive pure

818
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,840
glycolic serum. I get it. You also

819
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,200
however belt and suspenders this you

820
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,640
believe we ought to be able to for

821
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,720
optimal results combine it with

822
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,120
something else. Yes. So let's make sure

823
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,799
we use glycolic acid always at night.

824
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,760
Three four drops a little goes a long

825
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,159
way. But after cleansing what happens

826
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,480
the next morning make sure before you go

827
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,679
out you put an SPF a moisturizer with

828
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,720
SPF. I recommend the L'Oreal Revital

829
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,799
Triple Power um SPF 30. And why? because

830
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,960
it also happens to have the top three

831
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,120
derm recommended ingredients. Those are

832
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,480
do you know? No. Educate me. Pro

833
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,399
retinol, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid.

834
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,120
And this formula has been specifically

835
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,200
formulated to provide super powerful

836
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,440
results on aging skin. All right. So, I

837
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,799
actually asked power couple, huh? Power

838
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,159
couple. Right. So, we have a power

839
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,679
couple here. Two of our viewers agreed

840
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,080
to join us. They've been using L'Oreal's

841
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,760
glycolic acid serum and the SPF 30 for

842
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,600
10 weeks. You did it. Okay. Right. Yes.

843
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,039
All right. So, I have before and afters.

844
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,720
I think these are pretty stunning, but

845
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,600
we got to just So, this is before and

846
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,919
after Audriana's skin before the L'Oreal

847
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,679
product and this afterwards. So, you're

848
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,360
here today. What kind of difference did

849
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,279
you notice? Were you surprised,

850
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,240
impressed? I was actually trying to

851
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,120
prove them wrong. I'm I'm a skeptic by

852
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,720
nature. So, I actually went into it

853
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,279
thinking it's not going to work. I've

854
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,760
been using expensive products. I've been

855
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,880
trying to ward off the dark spots and

856
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,240
nothing worked. So, this was just, okay,

857
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,159
I'm going to prove them wrong. The dark

858
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,080
spots really Yeah, I see that. It's

859
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,960
remarkable. It is remarkable what it

860
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,440
did. But the bonus the bonus was that

861
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,480
the fine lines were starting to are

862
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,080
starting to fade and it was it's a

863
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,279
phenomenal product. I mean, if I could

864
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,679
buy stocks into your product, I would.

865
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,440
And so, that's why I see such a huge

866
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,880
difference. And within the 10 weeks, I

867
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,760
have gotten very um so many compliments

868
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,760
on what my skin looks like. I've been

869
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,360
going out with nothing now. Look at

870
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,559
that. So Leah, you did the same thing

871
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,159
again. I have a before and after if I

872
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,640
can show that. And we had you guys take

873
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,799
your own photos. So you know, pretty

874
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,200
dramatic changes in pigmentation, the

875
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,840
smoothness. Hyperpigmentation is

876
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,080
absolutely outstanding. Look at that. We

877
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,039
also I want to point out, let's look at

878
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,640
this area as well. Fantastic results. So

879
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,000
Leah, your thoughts and describe how

880
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,399
your skin actually felt before and

881
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,399
after. Yes, it's really amazing because

882
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,159
I have used other products over the

883
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,720
counter and through the dermatologist

884
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,640
before and it was very drying. I would

885
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,320
get a lot of redness, a lot of flaking.

886
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,399
I try to stick with it for a couple

887
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,200
weeks and then I just gave up. And this

888
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,799
product was amazing because they didn't

889
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,000
there wasn't any of that drying effect

890
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,080
or the redness. So I really believe that

891
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,559
it has done a wonderful job with the

892
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,480
dark spots. I have a lot of sun damage

893
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,279
as you can see in those pictures. It's

894
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,200
just remarkable. We all do. It's It's

895
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,440
remarkable. And then the other bonus was

896
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,120
the fine lines. So, so if folks want to

897
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,240
find the products, where do they get it?

898
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,919
What does it cost? Actually, because

899
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,039
cost could be an issue. They're less

900
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,159
than $24 at Walmart. Isn't that amazing?

901
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,080
It's amazing. I've been telling

902
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,240
everybody results. I tell everybody

903
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,279
about it. These are un retouched. So,

904
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,720
what do you think about the audience?

905
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,480
They're about to rush us here because

906
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,240
they're so angry that these two guests

907
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,000
of ours got these. What do you think?

908
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,240
One one one little dollop for every

909
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,600
audience member. No, don't be stingy.

910
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,760
We're going to give them both. How about

911
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,640
that? All right. The entire audience,

912
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,600
thanks to my partner L'Oreal Paris. The

913
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,000
entire audience is going home with

914
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,720
Revital 10% pure glycolic acid serum and

915
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Revital triple power SPF 30. Enjoy it.

916
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,000
Look beautiful. We'll be right

917
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,099
back.

918
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,099
[Music]

919
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,480
From helping with your cough and

920
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,799
congestion to dry skin and chapped lips,

921
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,519
so many of you consider your humidifier

922
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,720
a winter weather necessity, right? But

923
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,799
can they be more harmful than helpful,

924
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,440
filling the air with excess debris and

925
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,360
mold, maybe bacteria. It's not only

926
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,440
gross, but what's lurking in your

927
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,159
humidifier may aggravate your asthma or

928
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,720
your allergies. So, my guest today says

929
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,960
she may have the filthiest humidifier in

930
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,080
America. Jessica has had this humidifier

931
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,919
for three years. Never cleaned it once.

932
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,519
Looks pretty on the outside, but is

933
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,679
apparently leaking some kind of a peach

934
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,519
colored slime. What is that? It is. And

935
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,360
Dr. Oz, no matter how hard I try to

936
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,960
clean it, I pull it apart. I go in

937
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,200
there, I try to scrub it, you physically

938
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,720
can't get into the mechanism. And when I

939
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,200
open it and look in there, I see this

940
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,720
kind of like peach slime that I just

941
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,320
can't scrub out. And then I don't know,

942
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,919
can I use a chemical on it? Is it safe

943
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,760
to use bleach? Because then I'm going to

944
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,119
heat it up and put it into the air. So,

945
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,639
I just don't know how to clean it

946
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,040
properly. I'm hoping that I do a good

947
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,720
job in that. Three years a long time.

948
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,320
What What is the problem with just

949
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,399
getting in there, even if it's a pain in

950
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,280
the neck, and cleaning the humidifier?

951
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,000
You physically can't. You can't reach

952
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,440
into some of these little crevices. You

953
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,960
can do an outside cleaning of it and

954
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,159
even on the column, but to try and get

955
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,359
into that water tank is nearly

956
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,720
impossible. So, most of us are not

957
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,480
cleaning it or that we don't know how to

958
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,000
clean it. I would assume that it's it's

959
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,919
impossible to clean it as well as you

960
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,119
think you might be doing or you want to.

961
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,399
Now, the compound issues, if I

962
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,399
understand correctly, you run it all day

963
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,399
long. I do. What is your biggest fear

964
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,399
about what might be lurking in this

965
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,760
beautiful humidifier that has not been

966
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,320
cleaned? I fear that there's something

967
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,560
toxic or some kind of bacteria or some

968
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,240
kind of creature or something that I'm

969
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,760
then spraying into the air in my home

970
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,800
without even knowing. Is there a small

971
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,200
animal in there? What do you think that

972
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,800
is? Yeah, I think it's swimming and

973
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,160
crawling. I see that there's some nooks

974
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,200
and crannies, but I know there are ways

975
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,560
of cleaning it, which we'll get back to

976
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,720
in a second. So, don't let your

977
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,520
imagination run too wild. When we come

978
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,560
back, we're going to talk a little bit

979
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,920
about what we actually found in here

980
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,680
because we did a little homework, but I

981
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,839
want to find out what could be lurking

982
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,599
inside this humidifier. All right, so

983
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,880
stick around. My head of my medical

984
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,280
unit, Dr. Michael Crooppin, has been

985
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,040
looking into this. First things first,

986
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,200
Jessica and so many others love their

987
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,320
humidifier. What is the deal here? Well,

988
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,000
cool air brings dry air and more

989
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,280
congestion. And when parents hear their

990
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,880
kids having trouble breathing because

991
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,480
they're congested or coughing or even

992
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,000
just sniffling, they want something to

993
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,920
do. So they bring in the humidifier,

994
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,200
which adds more moisture to that air,

995
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,720
and then that's supposed to help break

996
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,720
up the mucus to make it easier to

997
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,920
breathe, right? But so the med unit

998
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,520
looked into it and see if there's any

999
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,280
data to show that this is actually the

1000
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,440
case. And there isn't any, but they are

1001
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,040
recommended by pediatricians. But what

1002
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,720
most people don't think about is that

1003
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,480
humidifier is making all this mist,

1004
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,599
right? And if it can send mist out that

1005
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,960
you're supposed to breathe in, it could

1006
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,320
also send out things that maybe you

1007
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,599
shouldn't be breathing in. So, it's

1008
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,640
really important to keep them clean. So,

1009
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,160
are there some folks who definitely

1010
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,440
should not be using humidifier? So, we

1011
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,960
couldn't find anyone who definitely

1012
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,720
shouldn't use a humidifier, but people

1013
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,480
who have asthma or allergies should

1014
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,000
probably be more careful because they

1015
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,240
might be more sensitive to anything that

1016
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,560
a dirty humidifier might be sending out.

1017
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,880
There's also a thing called humidifier

1018
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,480
lung. And this humidifier lung, that

1019
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,839
sounds strange. This is a condition that

1020
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,440
happens when something from the

1021
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,680
humidifier gets into the lungs and

1022
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,440
causes irritation and inflammation. And

1023
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,880
this is very rare, but just another

1024
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,000
reason why you should be cleaning your

1025
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,359
humidifier. Well, obviously if you turn

1026
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,560
the humidifier on, you don't feel well.

1027
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,760
That's sort of a clue you may have one

1028
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,200
of these conditions. Okay, tell us what

1029
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,640
may be lurking inside the humidifier.

1030
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,560
So, there's three things that we worry

1031
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,960
about in a humidifier. The first thing

1032
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,560
is debris. So, humidifiers are filled

1033
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,640
with water, right? And water is clear,

1034
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,240
but things can be dissolved in that

1035
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,599
water. And when you break up the water

1036
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,359
and turn it to mist, those things can

1037
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,839
come out. In humidifier lingo, it's

1038
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,760
known as white dust and it can be an

1039
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,200
irritant. Got it. and not using your

1040
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,480
humidifier or not cleaning it for three

1041
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,800
years, could that make it worse? It

1042
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,160
could. So, next thing is mold. We all

1043
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,240
know that mold is not good for us, but

1044
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,240
you know what mold really likes? What?

1045
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,320
Moisture. So, humidifiers are like

1046
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,079
beachfront property for mold. They can

1047
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,320
grow there and they can come out again

1048
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,040
in the mist and cause health problems.

1049
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,320
Beachfront property. Jessica's teetering

1050
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,400
over there. All right, the last thing is

1051
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,880
bacteria. So, bacteria like mold also

1052
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,880
really like warm moist environments. So,

1053
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,800
they can grow in a humidifier. Things

1054
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,320
like Legionella, Sudamonus are the most

1055
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,839
concerning that could be in there. But

1056
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,760
all kinds of bacteria could grow in

1057
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,040
there and come out with that mist. So

1058
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,640
Jessica, are you fearful of any of

1059
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,760
these? Terrified. Terrified. Terrified.

1060
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,200
All right. Well, when we come back,

1061
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,800
we're going to reveal the truth, right?

1062
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,160
Everyone pay attention here. What you

will be the other lesson we teach

1065
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,440
because you're right, it's hard, but

1066
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,440
it's doable. Stay with us.

1067
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,640
Coming up, the test results are in. and

1069
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,480
filthiest humidifier in America. Plus,

1070
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,480
tips on how to keep your humidifier

1071
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,680
[Music]

1072
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,480
clean. We swab what could be the

1073
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,000
filthiest humidifier in America. And

1074
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,359
we're about to reveal the lab test

1075
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,119
results. Let's remind everybody that

1076
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,599
Jessica's humidifier looked like this

1077
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,800
with a little bit of slime there. Are

1078
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,040
you nervous? Very frightened, in fact.

1079
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,320
So, a lot of people are like you. They

1080
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,640
have not been able to get in the nooks

1081
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,560
and crannies. So, we checked a couple

1082
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,960
things. Let me let me let me start off

1083
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:31,680
with the bacteria. We found 14.2 million

1084
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,800
colonies of bacteria, which is two to

1085
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,880
three times what you have on your

1086
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,480
arms. And I only bring that up because

1087
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,560
that's bacteria that's being pushed into

1088
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,200
the air that goes into your lungs. So

1089
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,040
imagine dirty skin three times more than

1090
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,200
your skin and you're I don't know

1091
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:51,240
breathing in the bacteria that are on

1092
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,520
it. Not ideal. That's horrible.

1093
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,920
However, the fungus and mold stuff we

1094
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,440
look for inconclusive. So you dodged a

1095
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,800
bullet there. And those are actually

1096
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,079
more of a problem oftentimes because

1097
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,960
they'll hide in your lungs for a long

1098
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:07,440
time. So what do you think?

1099
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,720
Um, I'm I'm terrified and repulsed at

1100
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,480
the same time knowing that even though I

1101
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,760
did try to clean it, that my efforts

1102
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,079
were in vain because it just didn't

1103
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,200
work. Well, do I got to say I I was

1104
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,640
curious about your question. These

1105
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,400
little nooks and crannies. I think the

1106
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,320
battle on the humidifier is not fought

1107
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,160
in that tiny bit of tubing. It's fought

1108
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,240
here. Oh, it's actually the big stuff.

1109
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,920
If you can keep keep the big stuff clean

1110
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,920
as much as you can, the small stuff

1111
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,119
takes care of itself. Sort of like life,

1112
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,880
right? Let me give you and everybody

1113
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,800
else some tips. Thanks, Jessica. Here

1114
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,400
are three tips to help everyone watching

1115
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,480
have the healthiest humidifier in

1116
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,400
America. First off, use distilled water.

1117
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,160
Invest in it. It's not that big a deal.

1118
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,720
You drink clean water. Put clean water

1119
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,800
in your lungs. Every day, empty, rinse,

1120
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,400
and dry the base before refilling. Every

1121
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,000
day. Don't let the water lie in there

1122
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,599
stagnantly because that will begin to

1123
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,280
accumulate and that the stuff you can't

1124
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,400
get to. And this is important. Every

1125
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,880
week, remove the water that scaling on

1126
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,560
the sides with vinegar and then bleach

1127
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,400
solution to disinfect the unit. Don't

1128
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,760
run it through the unit. Just clean off

1129
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,960
the sides. That way when you put the

1130
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,480
water in there, you're starting you're

1131
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,000
rebooting the system effectively. Can

1132
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,359
wash out whatever may be stuck in the

1133
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,040
small tubing. All right. Remember the

1134
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,040
power change it lies in the power used.

1135
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,320
Spread the word. One person, one voice,

1136
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,960
but you're speaking the truth. So it

1137
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,960
matters. Goodbye everybody.
