00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,160
A night at the movies could be scarier

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,759
than the film. What was the most

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,680
disturbing thing you found? We're

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,080
investigating the five germiest

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,240
hotspots. It was disgusting. That could

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,559
be playing at a theater near you. Number

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,800
one on our list. It is even dirtier than

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,039
your toilet. Plus, could you be buying

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,119
beef all wrong? When it's first ground

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,199
starts off looking bright red. The Dish

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,510
beef for your burger.

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,399
Today, an investigation into dirty movie

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,960
theaters. That sounds like it's a scene

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,960
out of a horror movie. Ooh, scary.

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,160
There's mice invasions, bugs like

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,720
cockroaches crawling around, and mystery

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,960
germs and bacteria all over. Take a look

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,200
at what was uncovered at movie theaters

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,360
that might make you make your skin

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,720
crawl. It is, of course, the weekend,

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,720
and there's a good chance you might be

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,479
headed to the movies. Well, before you

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,960
go, you just might want to see what Lisa

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,000
Guerrero found lurking inside some

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,479
theaters. When you go to the movies, you

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,040
expect the theater to be clean, but we

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,600
found that's not always the case. That's

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,400
disgusting. All that leftover popcorn

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,200
and candy can attract some unwanted

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,840
guests. That's a mouse popping out

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,799
between the seats inside a California

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,840
AMC theater. These mice were filmed by

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,960
another movie goer at a Texas AMC this

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,920
fall. And it's not just rodents. Corey

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,399
Vgillio says he was disgusted after he

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,520
discovered these bugs crawling all over

45
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,640
the carpet at this AMC theater in

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,880
Ontario, California. As I'm recording,

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,360
zooming in, I'm seeing multiple what

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,200
looks like to me baby cockroaches. He

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,360
spotted them after he dropped his keys

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,480
under the seat. That's when he also

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,800
noticed all this discarded food. There's

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,120
no reason that these filthy conditions

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,680
like that should have been uh underneath

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,080
my seat. Trash. So, we decided to take

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,879
our flashlights in movie theaters in New

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,040
York and New Jersey. And what we found

57
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,400
after the theaters were supposedly

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,400
cleaned may disgust you. Popcorn, candy,

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,560
trash everywhere. Remember, these

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,879
theaters are supposed to be cleaned in

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,400
between showings. We found discarded

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,080
cups, wrappers, liquor and soda bottles,

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,400
lots of gum, even a tooth flosser. Yuck.

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
And who takes off their socks during a

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,920
movie? But look what else we found at

66
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,080
this popular AMC in New York City's Time

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,720
Square. Trap after trap after trap right

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,720
behind the movie screen. There's popcorn

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
and candy stuck all the way back there.

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,920
It looks like it's been dragged back

71
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,680
there by rodents. It appears that you

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,599
guys have a rodent problem. Are you

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
aware of that? The manager didn't want

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,680
to answer our questions. And you can't

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,640
be in here doing this. But of all the

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,360
theaters we checked, this AMC had the

77
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,360
grossest conditions.

78
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,720
It's a dead rodent in a trap. It's so

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,599
gross. And look at all those droppings

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,680
and what appear to be mouse nests. We

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,440
found something that you need to see.

82
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
This manager agreed to take a look at

83
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,519
what we found behind the curtain. Do you

84
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,400
guys have a rodent problem here in this

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,560
theater? No, not really. He told us they

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,319
have a pest control service that comes

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,000
once a week. Do you think it would be

88
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,840
disturbing for your patrons to know that

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,120
there are mouse traps and dead rodents

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,280
just feed away from where they're

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
watching films?

92
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,879
I guess so. But it's also a much better

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,959
solution than actually not having traps

94
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,680
and having the rodents make an

95
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,920
appearance during the movie. So gross.

96
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,680
AMC told us their policy is to clean the

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,840
theaters after every show and again

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,760
after business hours. They say they work

99
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,599
closely with pest control experts at

100
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,319
their locations nationwide and say the

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,080
use of traps in non-public areas is a

102
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,720
common and effective practice to

103
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
eliminating pests. Oh my goodness.

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
Joining me now from Inside Edition is

105
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,360
investigative reporter Lisa Guo. I am

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,479
shocked by what you shown the traps with

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,479
mice that look like they almost

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,400
decomposed in there. Trash. Endless

109
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,160
amounts of it. Right. It was it was

110
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,479
pretty shocking. You know, we we wanted

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,800
to do this story because we saw a video

112
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,720
that people were posting on social media

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,720
that they took with their own phones

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,720
around the theaters that they were in.

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,639
And we thought, Dr. Oz, is this just,

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,560
you know, isolated incidents around the

117
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,400
country or is this happening everywhere?

118
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,919
So, we got out our flashlights and we

119
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,080
went to a bunch of different theaters

120
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,160
and we were really disturbed when we saw

121
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,919
the rodents and all the droppings. What

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,120
was the most disturbing thing you found?

123
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,759
Uh, at one theater, two nights in a row,

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,000
we saw the same dead rodent in a trap.

125
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,320
Oh, it was it was disgusting. The reason

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,160
that we're just iconically scared of

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,759
rodents is that they transmit disease,

128
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,880
right? A variety of diseases, all kinds

129
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,400
of bad things because they're rooting

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
around and stuff. And you when you come

131
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,919
into contact with rodent droppings, it

132
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,919
can be a big-time problem for a lot of

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,320
folks. So employees are supposed to

134
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,800
clean up the place. Sure. What's not

135
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,280
being done? Well, first of all, as

136
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,039
moviegoers, we shouldn't be littering as

137
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,639
badly as we do. First of all, we have to

138
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,360
take some responsibility for what we're

139
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,840
doing. Also, these companies maybe need

140
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,919
to hire more than one person to clean in

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,000
between. I mean, one person can only do

142
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,759
so much. And if you have five minutes to

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,360
clean an entire theater that hundreds of

144
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,280
people have just been in, that's an

145
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,639
impossible task. So, maybe these

146
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,759
companies need to hire more people to

147
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,720
clean the theaters. So, just to be

148
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,320
clear, everybody, I love going to

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,919
movies. I suspect most of you, too. I'm

150
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,039
not saying to stop watching movies at

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,639
theaters. We just need to be aware of

152
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,199
the problem so we can ask for change. So

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,280
Lisa's reporting got us curious about

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,520
the germs in a movie theater. So we did

155
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,639
our own germ swabbing to find out the

156
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,360
top five germiest hotspots. You all

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,280
curious about this? I thought so.

158
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
Remember, anything below a 50 is

159
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,919
considered clean. Anything above a 50,

160
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,160
we're just going to say it's dirty for

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,600
the sake of this show. Let's start with

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,360
number five, the selfs serve butter

163
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,800
dispenser,

164
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,400
which had a germ score of 122.

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,319
What is going on at the buttery at the

166
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,240
butter dispenser next to the popcorn?

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,080
Dr. Oz, don't you love butter? Everybody

168
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,840
loves butter on their popcorn. So, you

169
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,919
get your popcorn and you press that

170
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,960
dispenser and what are you doing? You're

171
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,800
putting your hand on the same spot that

172
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,360
everybody else has put their hand on.

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,440
And then you take that same hand and you

174
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,039
put it in your popcorn and you plop it

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,560
in your mouth and you lick your fingers.

176
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,000
So you're getting all those germs that

177
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,840
everybody else has left on that butter

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,520
dispenser. Guys, this is yet another

179
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,600
reason to hold back on the butter and

180
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,560
the popcorn. I've been telling you a

181
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,919
bunch of other ones. I haven't thought

182
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,840
of this one. One more reason. There you

183
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,560
go. All right. The fourth geriest spot

184
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,240
in a movie theater. Come over. I'll show

185
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,000
it to you myself cuz we actually brought

186
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,000
some into the studio. It is the seats.

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,280
Of course, Lisa have a seat. Do they

188
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
ever clean these? How do these get

189
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,520
things get uh into the sanitary

190
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,520
condition we want them to be in? Think

191
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,800
about this. Think about all the people

192
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
that are sitting in these seats,

193
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,919
especially during the summer time. And

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
you got your your shorts on and you got

195
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,639
your tank top and you're sweating and

196
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
you're sitting against the seat and then

197
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,800
the next group comes in. We checked with

198
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,360
movie theaters across the country and

199
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,160
they say that 14% of these theaters

200
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,759
clean less than four times a year these

201
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,520
seats. Four times a year. Yes. But 58%

202
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
said that they cleaned it every day,

203
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,840
which I find pretty suspicious. Are they

204
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,479
really going to disinfect and shampoo

205
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,440
these seats every single day? No. That

206
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,880
seems impossible. If you detect

207
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,720
something on a seat, make sure to tell

208
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,840
the manager the theater. Yeah, they

209
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
scrape the bubble gum off, but I don't

210
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
think they're going to clean this. Is

211
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,440
impossible? No, it's impossible. All

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,039
right, number three on the countdown.

213
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,720
The floor. And it's not just the

214
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,199
discarded food on the floor, but the

215
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,280
germs that everyone is tracking in. So,

216
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,000
what did you find after putting a purse

217
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,240
on the floor? So, we swabbed the purses.

218
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,160
Before we put a purse on the floor, the

219
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,800
germ score was 140. After we put the

220
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
purse on the floor, we swabbed it again.

221
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,680
226.

222
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,960
That's how disgusting what is on the

223
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,560
floor is getting on your purse. And

224
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,319
think about this. You then take the

225
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
purse home and you put it on your

226
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,039
kitchen counter. So all the germs from

227
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,160
this nasty floor are going home with you

228
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,960
to your kitchen bone appetite.

229
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,440
Enjoy yourselves everybody. The second

230
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,839
germiest spot in the movie theater is

231
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,320
the armrest. Right, which had a germ

232
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,320
score of 1,371.

233
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,640
Why is it that the armrests are dirtier

234
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,480
than the seats themselves? Cuz your

235
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,920
hands are dirty. And so when you put

236
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,000
your hand on the armrest,

237
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,680
you're getting your germs on there and

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,600
you're picking up everybody else's germs

239
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,279
that have been on the armrest. So that's

240
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,959
why so many people are touching the

241
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,480
armrest and you're bringing it home with

242
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,600
you, right? Chances are you're touching

243
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,279
the armrest. Then you know what you're

244
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,480
doing? You're touching your face without

245
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,760
even thinking about it. And you watch

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,839
them moving, you're nervous, you're

247
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,399
clawing at yourself. We found on average

248
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,640
you touch your face 16 times an hour.

249
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,920
That's one6 times an hour. It's

250
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,080
frequent. You're always doing something

251
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,320
up here. So, it matters that you've got

252
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
a armrest. That's a problem. Up next,

253
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,519
you're curious about it. The dirtiest

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,279
part of the movie theater and you're not

255
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,680
going to believe what it is. It is even

256
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,580
dirtier than your toilet seat. So, stick

257
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,340
around. What is it?

258
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,440
[Applause]

259
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,160
[Music]

260
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,640
An unlicensed doctor. I went in to get

261
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,560
my breath smaller. Scamming patients

262
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,240
instead. What did he do to your body?

263
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,240
Botching surgery. that went from a

264
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,360
double D to an N and how he took

265
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,920
advantage with sex and drugs. Plus, an

266
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,000
ex-husband turns up dead soon after the

267
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,480
divorce. A person approaches the car and

268
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,839
shoots Dan at point blank range. And who

269
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,720
the police zero in on, no one expected.

270
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,720
That's coming up tomorrow.

271
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,350
[Music]

272
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,880
You're seeing it all. We are back

273
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,800
investigating dirty movie theaters and

274
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,640
counting down the top five germ hot

275
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,040
spots. Now, we just went through the top

276
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,800
four, the butter dispenser, the seat,

277
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,000
the floor around you when you sit in the

278
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
movie theater, and of course, the

279
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,040
armrest because you're touching the

280
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,279
armrest and you're touching your face 16

281
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,440
times an hour. So now it's time to find

282
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,040
out the germiest spot in the theater.

283
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,640
Number one on our list. It is even

284
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,320
dirtier than your toilet. Inside edition

285
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,480
investigative reporter Lisa Guerrero is

286
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,240
back. The number one hot spot for germs

287
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,480
in your movie theater is drum roll

288
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,839
please. The cup holder. The cup holder.

289
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,120
We swapped the toilet. This is what the

290
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,360
numbers are. We swapped the toilet. Had

291
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,120
a germ score of 219.

292
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,360
That's not so clean but not that bad.

293
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,839
when we swabbed the cup holder. This cup

294
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,839
holder one like this had a germ score of

295
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,839
3,416.

296
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,839
So, how does this get so dirty, Lisa?

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,320
Well, think about it. First of all, the

298
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,320
cup holder has nooks and crannies, so

299
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,480
it's hard for their employees to get in

300
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,200
and to clean around the actual cup

301
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,360
holder. So, what I recommend, Dr. Oz, is

302
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,160
when you're drinking, only hold the top

303
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,760
of the cup and then put it down. never

304
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,240
touched the bottom of the cup that's

305
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,240
been in this nasty cup holder. So, now

306
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,440
that you become a world expert on dirty

307
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,480
movie theaters, what are you doing

308
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,399
differently? You've changed your whole

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,240
approach, I gather. I have. So, now I

310
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,320
get to the theaters early, about 15

311
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,279
minutes early, and I take my cell phone,

312
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,880
and you know how they have the

313
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,120
flashlight on it? So, I turn on my

314
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,760
little flashlight and I check underneath

315
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,760
the seat I'm going to be sitting in. Got

316
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,959
front, behind, all over the place cuz I

317
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,240
don't want to see any nasty. Most people

318
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
get there early anyway, right? To get

319
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,959
better seats. So, don't just sit there

320
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,640
and watch the commercials. do some work,

321
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,399
right? So, look around. Look around and

322
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,920
if you see something nasty, tell

323
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
management. They want to know and they

324
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,200
want it to be clean for you. Now, we

325
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,640
revealed a couple things that are really

326
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,399
problematic, like the dirt, the

327
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,839
dirtiness of the floor around you. So,

328
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,440
people have purses, right? What do you

329
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
do with it? Okay, so if you have a

330
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,839
purse, do what I do. Take a little

331
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,920
plastic bag with you, wad it up, stick

332
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,120
it in your purse. When you get there,

333
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,880
simply unfold it, throw your purse

334
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,360
inside, and then knot it up, stick it on

335
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,519
the floor while you watch the the movie,

336
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
and then when you're done, take it out

337
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,079
of the bag and throw it away on your way

338
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,639
out. And that way, this never actually

339
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,480
touches the floor. Or you can do what I

340
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,760
do.

341
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,000
Smart. Just wear a cross body bag. Never

342
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,680
let your bag touch the floor. The only

343
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
thing that should touch the floor,

344
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,000
bottom of your feet. Yeah. Keep your

345
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,200
shoes on and your socks. Yeah, exactly.

346
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,560
So, thank you very much. Very nicely

347
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,120
done. Appreciate the investment. We'll

348
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,120
be right back, everybody.

products, holds 120 patents all around

362
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,519
the world, including the Scrub Daddy,

363
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,160
right? Perhaps my favorite, the Squatty

364
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,920
Potty, cuz it really works.

365
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,040
Banttom bagels. We'll get to these in a

366
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,120
second because you don't know they taste

367
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,720
good. And it all started with this

368
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,959
little jewelry organizer that she

369
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,880
invented. It's pretty cool. But now Lori

370
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,639
Grineer has a brand new venture that's

371
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,279
not about selling you a product. It's

372
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,040
about inspiring you to sell yourself and

373
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,880
make your dreams come true. And she's

374
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,000
here today to reveal it. Please welcome

375
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,000
Shark Tanks Lori Grineer.

376
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,349
[Applause]

377
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,440
Thank you for coming on. Thank you.

378
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,639
Oh my goodness, you look good. Oh, you

379
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,519
look good. So, the thing about your

380
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,040
career is it has always reminded us that

381
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,040
there's a role for women in the

382
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,639
entrepreneurial world and I'm curious

383
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
since you're on the inside, do you feel

384
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,959
like it's changing? Are we equalizing

385
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,199
the playing field for for women where

386
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,279
was once very inhospitable? Well,

387
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,360
listen, I think being an entrepreneur

388
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,680
and deciding to take your own life into

389
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,240
your own hands already levels the

390
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,480
playing field, right? And I think,

391
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,959
right,

392
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,959
and women are amazing. They're

393
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,279
multitaskers. They're brilliant. They

394
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,760
can tackle and handle anything. And then

395
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,320
the one big piece of advice, don't think

396
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,160
of yourself as a woman out there. Think

397
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,519
of yourself as a person and the best

398
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,959
damn one there is. Yeah, a little.

399
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,240
So, I know all your fellow sharks and

400
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,399
I'm always curious what they're like

401
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,920
behind the scenes. So, share a little a

402
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,760
little dirt. Give us a scoop of what

403
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,639
what happens when the cameras are off on

404
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,399
Shark Tank. Well, uh, music starts in

405
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,639
between the entrepreneurs. We get about

406
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,079
five minute break and Mark Cuban is

407
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,560
always screaming at the top of his

408
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,680
lungs, singing with it. And then Damon

409
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,000
is an extremely funny guy and he knows I

410
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,920
crack up from his little um he tells

411
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,399
like little grade school jokes which I

412
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,720
find hilarious. I don't know why. Um so

413
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,959
he'll tell me those and usually try to

414
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,560
make us all laugh. We have a crafty

415
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,320
table where there's lots of food and

416
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,959
we're always starving and then we go up.

417
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,880
Crafty table means that they have like

418
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,440
um I don't know pizza and different

419
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,000
tamales and stuff that we can go get in

420
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,760
between the breaks and it's usually

421
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,759
empty by the time we get there cuz the

422
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,839
whole crew has eaten everything. So who

423
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,839
who has the unhealthiest diet among the

424
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,600
sharks? Oh wow. Um probably Cuban. I

425
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,560
think Cuban. Yeah. How'd you know that?

426
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,959
Cuz I played against him in the

427
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,360
celebrity basketball game. Yeah. Cuban.

428
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,279
Cuban.

429
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,680
He'll he'll vacasillate from being

430
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,440
really healthy to being atrociously

431
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,199
horrible. All right, let's talk about

432
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,800
this magazine. It's fantastic. It's

433
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,199
called Living Inspired. It's a

434
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,560
wonderfully crafted exercise like

435
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,000
everything you do. But what sets it

436
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,759
apart in your opinion from a lot of the

437
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,240
other magazines on the stance? Well,

438
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,519
listen, Living Inspired was truly a

439
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,079
labor of love. Every single page is by

440
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,480
me. I there's not one page in there that

441
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,040
was not truly done and touched by me.

442
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,199
Um, it has everything in it. I feel like

443
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,839
in a time of sometimes people not

444
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,160
feeling very positive, I wanted to put

445
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,720
out a magazine because I'm a big

446
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,600
believer in positivity, inspiration,

447
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,399
giving back, having fun, feeling

448
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,560
empowered. And so I wanted to put that

449
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,120
all in the magazine. And the magazine

450
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,279
truly is just pick it up for a minute.

451
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,079
It truly is all about, it's called

452
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:02,399
Living Inspired. So from the title

453
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,160
inside it is advice on work and at home

454
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,640
and it's these are from me. It's truly

455
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,640
advice at work and at home but there's

456
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,240
also like great places to travel,

457
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,880
wonderful things to eat at different

458
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,160
levels, all budgets. There's um how to

459
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,880
sleep better. There's advice on deep

460
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,199
discounts, great products that I love.

461
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,919
I've heard from people say that have

462
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,000
read it thus far that when they open it

463
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,679
up, maybe they weren't in the best mood

464
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,760
or, you know, they weren't even in a

465
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,000
good mood, but when they were done, they

466
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,840
felt happier, they felt inspired, they

467
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,640
felt like they could tackle anything.

468
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,280
They felt like you could do this and um

469
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,280
that their life was better. So, that's

470
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,799
what the intention was. And I'm really

471
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,240
glad to hear that's how it's working.

472
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,160
Well, will you share some of your wisdom

473
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,760
with some of our audience members?

474
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,600
Absolutely. Entrepreneurs, come on over.

475
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,120
some amazing tips to attract everyone to

476
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,880
greatness. So Lor's gonna give some

477
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,320
advice to some entrepreneurs looking for

478
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,400
a little inspiration that many of you

479
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,320
out there for example says she has a

480
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
vision but has a hard time taking a

481
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,400
first step and making it happen. You

482
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,960
brought your vision with some products

483
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,200
to demonstrate. Yes, my name is Tasia

484
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,240
and I'm the creator of Body Party which

485
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,320
is an allnatural skin care line. Uh so I

486
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,760
have butters, scrubs, glow oils which is

487
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,720
an illuminating body oil. I'm working on

488
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,360
cuticle oil, eyelash serum, and body

489
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,280
wax. So, what's your advice? So, my

490
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,520
advice would be first thing, most

491
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,919
important, what is the key thing that

492
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,799
makes your products stand out versus any

493
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,480
other body butters or scrubs? So, I try

494
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,200
to also create custom uh butters and

495
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,640
products for anybody's personal skin

496
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,240
care and skinincare issues. Uh so, I

497
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,080
create a questionnaire and that's why I

498
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
have here what is my skin type? A lot of

499
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,160
people don't know what their skin type

500
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,840
is. So for all my customers, I ask them,

501
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,000
"What is your skin type? What are you

502
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,880
battling with?" And then I try to create

503
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,360
the product based on their issue. Well,

504
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,600
my advice would be because this is so

505
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,400
customized and specialized, I think you

506
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,480
should stay online as a business because

507
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,880
otherwise um you know, you'd need an

508
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,960
army of people to be out in retail

509
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,520
asking people those questions. But you

510
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,679
can easily fill out a questionnaire. I

511
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,240
would try to get out there um and get

512
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,559
this out there in a social buzz way. I

513
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,799
think Instagram ads are fabulous. I

514
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,679
don't know about anybody else.

515
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,640
They are fabulous. They work. Yes. And I

516
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,960
think grow slowly. Grow slowly and keep

517
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,360
learning from your customers. Priceless

518
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,799
advice. Yeah. Be sure to check out Lor's

519
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,799
new magazine. It's called Living

520
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,559
Inspired. It's on stage right now. Thank

521
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,280
you for being my hero. Appreciate it.

522
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,760
All right, guys. Be right back.

523
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,480
[Applause]

524
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,400
It's the biggest burger bash ever. Stay

525
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,840
tuned for a chef's secret to upgrading

526
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,480
your everyday burgers and turning them

527
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,320
into an ooey gooey cheesy delight. Just

528
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,320
be warned, you're about to get very

529
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,320
hungry.

530
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,520
What if you could see what the future

531
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,640
you looks like? Would you see wrinkles

532
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,039
and lines? Dry, crepey skin from years

533
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,280
of not moisturizing?

534
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,360
Maybe sunspots from not wearing

535
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,200
sunscreen religiously?

536
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,760
Could changing something about your skin

537
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,160
care routine today make a difference

538
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,720
down the road? Well, with the help of my

539
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,039
trusted sponsorship partner, Olay, we're

540
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,520
taking a look into the future of your

541
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,280
skin to help you visualize the impact of

542
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,799
your current skincare routine. And to do

543
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,880
this, Olay principal scientist Dr. The

544
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,440
broken Noisa is joining us. Bro, thanks

545
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,120
for being here as always.

546
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,039
I love how you break your stuff down,

547
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,880
keep it straight up. The biggest mistake

548
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,520
that we're all making with our skin that

549
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,159
will affect the future of our skin is

550
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,840
not wearing sunscreen every day. You

551
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,799
know, we do a lot of things to take care

552
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,480
of ourselves, our minds, our bodies.

553
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,000
But, you know, too often we don't think

554
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,559
of our skin and our sunare as a form of

555
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,280
self-care. You know, sure, most of us,

556
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,360
you know, moisturize our skin to offset

557
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,400
some of the effects of aging, but you

558
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,679
cannot stop there. Did you know that one

559
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,440
week of incidental everyday UV exposure

560
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:20,880
equals one day at the beach? It does.

561
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,880
So, wearing sunscreen on a daily basis

562
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,799
is one of the most important self-care,

563
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,799
wellness actions we can take for

564
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,640
ourselves. So, you always bring hard

565
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,320
science, new ideas. Yeah.

566
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,159
So, how are we going to get people to

567
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,799
value the importance of their skin care,

568
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,840
especially against sun, right? So, the

569
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:45,120
scientists at Ole created a technology

570
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,760
um to show you what your skin will look

571
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,919
like in the future. It's called Future

572
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,720
You and it's an advanced simulation

573
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,880
algorithm that is based in a huge

574
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,320
database of thousands of facial images

575
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,000
from women of all ages, all skin types,

576
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,200
all ethnicities. What you were seeing

577
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,320
there was one example, one small extract

578
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:12,159
of that database, a Caucasian average

579
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,880
face aging from 10 to 80 years old and

580
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,919
back. And we can use this technology to

581
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,280
predict what your face and skin are

582
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,400
going to look like in the future. So

583
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,600
what do we do? What's the goal once

584
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,080
you've generated this information

585
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,080
besides scaring the heck out of us?

586
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,240
Well, so first of all, it's really for

587
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,600
so that women better understand their

588
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,760
skin and how it changes over time. so

589
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,799
ultimately that they can better select

590
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,080
and tailor their skinincare regimens to

591
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,799
their personal needs and circumstances

592
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,120
so they can have the best skin they can

593
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,960
for as long as possible. Right. So, you

594
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,720
brought some examples to us. What do

595
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,320
they do to come up with to change

596
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,760
people's attitudes because you're very

597
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,000
concrete and very specifically it's

598
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,360
focused on sunscreen waking people up to

599
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,600
some of the numbers you've given us.

600
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,640
Yes. Well, so what we can actually do

601
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,240
with the future U technology, we can

602
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:07,520
model different behaviors. We can model

603
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,640
great skincare habits such as wearing an

604
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,400
SPF every day. And once people accept,

605
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,559
okay, I should be wearing a sunscreen

606
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,080
every day. We need to provide great

607
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,480
products that don't feel like the

608
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,559
typical sunscreen. So, not too greasy,

609
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,559
not too heavy, or else women are not

610
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,919
going to use them. We know that.

611
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:30,400
So, we came up with Olay Regenerous Web

612
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,799
SPF 25. It's a moisturizer with built-in

613
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,000
UV protection. Doesn't feel like a

614
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,960
sunscreen. Leaves your skin with a

615
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,799
breathable, very light finish. Or if

616
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,360
you're looking for even more UV

617
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:47,679
protection, how about you try the new

618
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:50,320
Olay Sun Shine Control with SPF 35. It's

619
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,120
a a light oil-free facial sunscreen

620
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,360
lotion specifically designed to

621
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,679
flawlessly blend into your skin and

622
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,039
leave it shine free with a matte smooth

623
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,400
finish. Right. So, we're going to do a

624
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,240
little experiment together. Beauty

625
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,159
director at Shape and Parents magazine,

626
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,840
Kate Sandival Box is here. She's also

627
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,600
here on behalf of Olay and she's tried

628
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,000
the future simulation. You are very

629
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,039
brave to share your data with us. We're

630
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,559
and you're all going to see it in a

631
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,919
second, but this is the point to wake

632
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,520
you up to the mistakes you may be making

633
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,279
so you don't make them. So, walk us

634
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,440
through like Dr. what we're looking at.

635
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,600
Right. So, what we did obviously earlier

636
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,360
this morning before the show before um

637
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,360
Kate went into hair and makeup, we took

638
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,600
a picture of her. Obviously, wanted to

639
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,320
keep it as realistic as possible. So,

640
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,679
this is her picture and then we um took

641
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,960
it through the simulation. So, I'm going

642
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,640
to show you. I can use this little

643
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,640
slider here. Do you want me to deage you

644
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,960
first? So, this is you today. I can

645
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,440
actually make you look a little younger.

646
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,840
So now we're 5, six, seven, eight, nine,

647
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,279
10 years older. And what I want to what

648
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,720
I want you to look at is what is

649
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,159
actually changing with age. It's three

650
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,480
things. Most people think wrinkles and

651
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,559
texture, but that's just one aspect. And

652
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,360
you're probably actually too young for a

653
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,720
lot of that. Face shape changes as we

654
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,000
age as well. But the third thing, what

655
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,799
what we're really seeing here with you

656
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,720
is hyperpigmentation, skin tone. So you

657
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,720
see that pigmentation coming through and

658
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,080
we know exactly what the main cause of

659
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,520
that is. It's unprotected UV exposure,

660
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,279
right? So, it is largely preventable.

661
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,120
And actually, let me show you something.

662
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,039
Okay, I'm gonna go to next. So, this is

663
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,520
the final stage of future U actually

664
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,000
shows you this is your skin's future in

665
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,240
10 years time. If you follow the average

666
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,640
aging curve, average I mean for your

667
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,080
age, for your skin type and ethnicity,

668
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,240
right? Thousands of women. However, how

669
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,880
about this alternate future? You could

670
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,279
also look like this, Kate. And the key

671
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,000
difference is great skincare habits

672
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:47,200
including using SPF every day which will

673
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,039
prevent a large amount of the UV damage

674
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,440
that leads to hyperpigmentation. So

675
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,600
Kate, how do the stimulation change your

676
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,600
attitude towards sunscreen? I think it's

677
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,520
really a wakeup call for a lot of

678
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,200
people. I hear from readers all the time

679
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,279
about sunscreen and they say that they

680
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,840
know they should be wearing it, but they

681
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,799
still aren't applying it consistently.

682
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,880
And FutureU is showing you the effects

683
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,679
of those skincare habits or lack

684
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,760
thereof. In fact, at Shape, we just

685
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,320
named it one of the coolest new skinare

686
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,080
technologies of 2019 because of its

687
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,679
potential to be so Congratulations.

688
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,799
So, you recently started using your

689
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,919
sunscreen uh control product, which I I

690
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,880
must point out, you mentioned it very

691
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,000
briefly, but it's sort of a matte

692
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,440
finish. It doesn't make you look like

693
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,960
you're reflective, which my wife was

694
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,039
always complaining to me about. Right.

695
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,559
Exactly. So, has it has it affected you

696
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,400
in ways that are positive? How's it

697
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,559
how's it worked? Absolutely. I started

698
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,720
using it. Immediately when I put it on,

699
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,360
I noticed that I didn't feel anything on

700
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,960
my skin. And heavy, greasy sunscreen is

701
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,760
what everybody complains about,

702
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,679
including me. This left no residue. I

703
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,440
could put makeup on right away. It

704
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,760
doesn't have that telltale sunscreen

705
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,679
smell either. So, bottom line, no

706
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,200
excuses anymore. Don't skip the

707
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,240
sunscreen. So if if you already have a

708
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,480
regimen for taking care of your skin,

709
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,000
moisturizer, yes, retinols, whatever

710
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,679
you're doing, how does the sunscreen

711
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,720
work into that? Yeah. So clearly, I

712
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,799
mean, when you take care of your skin,

713
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,880
it's, you know, moisturization and SPF

714
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,520
protection are the two big important

715
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,159
things. Um, and so no matter whether

716
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,279
you're using the uh Olay Regenerous uh

717
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,840
whip SPF 25, which is moisturizer and

718

use the Olay Sunshine Control, which is

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,120

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,919

744
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,720
everyone to the table to dish on

745
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,039
everything. From the latest food hacks

746
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,520
and trends to everyday recipes you can

747
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,440
make for dinner tonight. Singing is my

748
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,360
first love, but my other passion is

749
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,919
baking.

750
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,520
I'm an iron chef, but mostly the

751
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,520
executive chef of Butter Restaurant and

752
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,120
mother to an 11year-old. This is the

753
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,320
first recipe I ever made in a

754
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,559
professional kitchen. They were

755
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,799
terrible. My cooking is like me. A mix

756
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,320
of Caribbean heat meet southern sweet.

757
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,360
This is like my girlfriend in the

758
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,159
kitchen. I am as a chef first and

759
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,080
foremost about flavor. It's simple. It's

760
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,919
celebratory. And most of all, it's about

761
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,550
having a great time in the kitchen. What

762
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:04,990

801
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,960
that you make burgers at home. You guys

802
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,799
check this out. Okay, we are doing

803
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,720
muffin tin sliders. All right. Yes. Get

804
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,640
excited about that. So, you just season

805
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,080
your beef. Preheat your oven to 450 and

806
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,760
just do a little salt and pepper on the

807
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,200
outside there. Make sure you always

808
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,720
season your burger. That's the key to

809
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,799
make having good flavored burger. Then

810
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,039
you'll place the patty inside the muffin

811
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,159
tins. And you just cook for 5 minutes.

812
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,240
And of course, you got to add a little

813
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,000
cheddar cheese to it. And then load up

814
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,679
all your toppings. Onions, pickles, you

815
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,080
have it. You name it. Put it on that

816
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,640
burger, baby. Okay. Do we not love that?

817
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,640
Those cute little sliders. You corrupted

818
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,000
the muffin taste and then you enjoyed

819
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,559
guys. Now, we all know that all burgers

820
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,240
aren't created equally and there is one

821
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,720
rivalry that has left our country

822
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,279
divided. Yes. Which coast makes better

823
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,840
burgers, east coast or west coast? So

824
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:17,440
today, West Coast. Already we have

825
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,399
opinions. East Coast.

826
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,600
Well, well, yeah. Boo. Exactly. So today

827
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:27,520
we're squashing this aid old beef once

828
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,200
and for all with a burger bash debate.

829
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,720
Here to represent the east coast,

830
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,360
Jamaica.

831
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,200
East Coast. Yes. Yes. East Coast in the

832
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,360
house. Yes. Now you're going to argue

833
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,000
why you think Shake Shack has the best

834
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,640
burger. And representing the West Coast,

835
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,120
Daphne.

836
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,799
Come on, guys. There's no Westies out

837
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,640
here. This is ridiculous. That applause

838
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,519
was really life, but choice and burger

839
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,840
was not. You mean you're you're you're

840
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,039
on team In-N-Out Burger. I am. And

841
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,720
you're going to rep and you're going to

842
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,799
tell us why you think that's the best.

843
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,039
Each of you has 20 seconds to make your

844
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,640
case for who has the best burger. Okay.

845
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,159
I'm going to start with you, Jamaica. 20

846
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,440
seconds on the clock. Let's go. Watch.

847
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,360
All right. I am a Shake Shack girl

848
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,279
because they use potato rolls and they

849
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,120
toast and butter their rolls before they

850
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,120
make them. The beef comes from a

851
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,200
proprietary blend of beef from a

852
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,519
legendary butcher and they grill it in a

853
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,120
cast iron skillet. And do not get me

854
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,960
started on that special sauce. I mean,

855
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,600
come on now.

856
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,120
Shake shack in the house. Yes. Hold it.

857
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,720
That fighting words. She crushed it with

858
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,080
3 seconds remaining and she crushed it.

859
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,760
Is there a real clock? All right, Duffy.

860
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,760
There is an actual clock on you right

861
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,039
now. So, we got You ready? Dig your

862
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,120
heels in. You ready? I'm ready. All

863
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,240
right. West Coast baby 20 seconds. All

864
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,000
right, you guys. Here's my In-N-Out

865
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,399
Burger. It reigns supreme forever and

866
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,720
ever. Familyowned since the beginning of

867
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,240
time. A proprietary blend of their own

868
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,080
meat made the same way. I'm about a

869
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,000
classic with a twist. I have two words

870
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,080
for you. Animal style. We are talking

871
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,919
about caramelized onions, rich brown

872
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,480
sauce, American cheese sauce, special

873
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,559
sauce on a sesame seed bun. You can't go

874
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,880
wrong from that. Perfect onions, perfect

875
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,799
fries. All right, that's it. Perfect.

876
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,600
All right. So, if you guys agree with

877
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:09,600
Jamaica that East Coast burgers are the

878
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,440
best, give us a round of applause. Okay.

879
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,919
Yes.

880
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,000
Yes. Thank you.

881
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,960
Oh, no. All right. What about Daphne

882
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,960
with the West Coast argument?

883
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,399
All right. No soup for you. All right. I

884
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,080
hate to beat the pregnant lady, but I

885
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,760
think I won this one. I'm so sorry. I

886
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,440
love how you decided you won. All right.

887
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,200
Jimmy, you got it. It was pretty

888
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,559
obvious. No matter where you live,

889
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,000
finding the best ground beef for your

890
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,519
burger can be a pretty daunting task.

891
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,360
So, today, we're helping you through all

892
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,039
the confusion. So, first you got to

893
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,480
figure out the right cut. You want to

894
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,080
look for the chuck. Please demonstrate

895
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,679
the chuck, Alex, if you don't mind. The

896
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,279
chuck is right here. Right there. See?

897
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,360
Elegantly located. More bang for your

898
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,440
buck. This is a great allaround purpose

899
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,039
for ground beef since it's not too fatty

900
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,159
and not too lean. It's got tons of

901
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,600
flavor, which is what I care about.

902
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,880
Actually, when I have meat, I want it to

903
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,880
taste good. Daffy, come over here for

904
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,919
one second. Yes. Talk about color here.

905
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,360
This is something that a lot of folks

906
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,640
mess up. This is this is really cool.

907
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,000
Again, this is like when you're in the

908
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,120
grocery store and you're looking for the

909
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,039
right thing to buy because there are a

910
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,120
lot of ground beef options in the in the

911
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,359
butcher pack and also in your sort of

912
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,960
fresh pack and takeaway areas. Beef when

913
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,159
it's first ground starts off looking

914
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,200
bright red like well more like this. Um,

915
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,040
and as it oxidizes over time is when it

916
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,280
starts to get a little bit lighter in

917
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,280
color and then into this more brown and

918
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,119
then eventually into gray category,

919
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,879
which is how you know it's been let sit

920
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,720
outside for a bit. But if you're looking

921
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,159
for something already ground, get it as

922
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,440
bright, nice, fresh, and red as you

923
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,399
possibly can. Right. So then the

924
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,119
question is, do you make it yourself?

925
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,320
You get patties. Alex, honest here.

926
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,879
Yeah, honestly. Takes a little while to

927
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,960
make these. Yeah. Honesty. I have to say

928
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,119
if you buy your meat from the same place

929
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,960
and you trust it. I would go for ground.

930
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,320
I really would. And there's no no shame

931
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,119
in buying the ground meat, the

932
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,399
pre-formed patties. I like to mix them

933
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,919
up a little bit. Even if they're

934
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,040
preformed. I think it's nice when

935
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,040
there's a little bit of that uneven

936
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,720
touch, but no shame in ground meat. Do

937
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,280
you raise it up high like this or you

938
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,440
squish it down? It depends on how long I

939
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,320
have to cook and how how hungry I am.

940
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,480
Okay. Two thin patties like that is

941
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,480
gonna cook quickly. Yeah. If I have

942
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,000
time, if I'm basting, if I'm putting a

943
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,760
cast iron skillet on the stove and then

944
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,200
in the oven, I'll go thicker. But you

945
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,280
know what? All in all, you want an even

946
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,800
patty, not too thick. And you don't want

947
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,640
the portion to get out of control. You

948
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,160
know what I mean?

949
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,359
Now she's talking about not like 80

950
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,119
burgers like you see there. Okay. All

951
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,560
this burger talk is making me hungry.

952
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,480
you stick around because Alex has a

953
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,079
burger and cheese sauce recipe you do

954
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,520
not want to miss. Stick around. Pass

955
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,520
those sliders here. Pass those sliders.

956
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,160
I love getting to talk with you on my

957
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,400
show every single day. But when the

958
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,720
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

959
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,720
is not over. I still have a lot that I

960
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,520
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

961
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,450
Oz podcast on Apple Podcast or wherever

962
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,690
you get your podcast.

963
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,890
[Applause]

964
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,290
[Music]

965
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,290
[Applause]

966
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,560
We're back with a dish on Oz and today

967
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,640
is all about burgers. Alex is the queen

968
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,040
of crafting the best burger and her

969
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,440
secret weapon. She swears it's bathing

970
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,839
the beef in a silky cheese sauce for

971
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,520
some more fun between the buns. Oh yeah,

972
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,040
she said that. All right, Alex, why do

973
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,440
you think cheese can either make or

974
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,800
break the perfect burger? You know, I I

975
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,720
people that say to me, "I just want a

976
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,200
hamburger. I just want ketchup, no bun,

977
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,440
and a pickle. They're not to be trusted.

978
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,320
These are not friends. That's the future

979
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,240
enemy at hand. You need some cheese with

980
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,000
your burger. You just do. It's It's

981
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,680
balancing. You know, it's a balancing

982
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,359
act in life. You know what I mean? So,

983
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,599
what makes the perfect cheese sauce? All

984
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,280
right. So, I was thinking, you know, I

985
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,359
love two slices of American cheese

986
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,880
crisscross over melty. I love that.

987
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,800
Sometimes you want something different.

988
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,880
A simple cheese sauce. You can make this

989
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,359
ahead. I love this sizzling. I hear

990
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,440
that. It's like hard to talk. Okay, so

991
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,960
this is just a simple cheese sauce. You

992
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,680
could make it with a rue. I went

993
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,320
simpler. Just some cream simmering with

994
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,240
some grainy mustard for thickness. He's

995
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,280
like, "Please pay attention to me. I

996
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,800
love it. Look at you." So just cream in

997
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,640
here so far. Yeah, cream. A little

998
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,400
grainy mustard, a little paprika. You're

999
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,960
going to put a dash of hot sauce and a

1000
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,119
dash of woristure. Not enough that you

1001
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,960
really feel salt and heat. Oh my god, I

1002
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,599
love it. Give the pregnant woman the hot

1003
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,680
sauce and look what happens.

1004
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,480
And a little worshir sauce. I love

1005
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,680
worashir sauce. And then just simmer

1006
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,040
that cream a little bit and then just

1007
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,119
start whisking in all that cheese.

1008
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,480
That's actually what gives it the body.

1009
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,560
And then when you build your burger,

1010
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,960
then you just pour the cheese sauce like

1011
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,359
a cascading waterfall over your burger.

1012
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,119
Oh my. Right. Are you going into

1013
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,440
surgery? What are those? I am scrubbing

1014
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,160
in, doc. Okay. I am scrubbing into the

1015
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,160
waiting room of my world, which is

1016
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,480
ground beef. Um, you know, the thing

1017
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,400
about making a burger is that meat can

1018
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,400
get overworked the way cake batter can,

1019
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,560
the way flour can. When you overwork

1020
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,119
cake batter or bread dough, the flour

1021
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,040
gets tough and chewy. So does meat. It

1022
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,839
does not want to be taken to the gym a

1023
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,680
thousand times with you. So just gently

1024
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,400
spread it. Notice how I've pushed it up

1025
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,040
around the sides. That way I can season

1026
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,200
more surface area and just season it

1027
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,440
once and the seasoning really gets in

1028
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,760
there, right? Just gently mix it

1029
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,680
together. Don't overwork it. I mean, you

1030
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,440
really don't want to let these the meat

1031
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,680
and the salt sit together. When you

1032
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,520
brine meat, right, brine a turkey or a

1033
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,280
chicken. I love how he gets involved.

1034
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,119
She's a good griller. Yeah, this is my

1035
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,960
specialty. I'm I'm rescuing these

1036
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,720
burgers. Thank you. When you brine a

1037
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,880
chicken, right, it gets it changes the

1038
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,040
texture. You don't want salt to sit on

1039
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,839
beef. Thank you, Doc. I'm glad you

1040
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,920
scrubbed in with us. All right. So once

1041
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,359
you form your burgers, right, then you

1042
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,760
want to put a little dimple in the

1043
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,720
center. That flattens the burger out as

1044
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,320
it cooks so it sears more evenly. And we

1045
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,079
like that. All right. So now you got

1046
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,599
your burgers there. Dimpled as they are.

1047
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,520
Dimpled as they are. They're dimpling

1048
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,680
away. They're cooking. And now we're

1049
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,119
going to stuff. And now I mean it's time

1050
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,480
really to Is it time to eat? I think

1051
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,320
it's time. We have your prepared buns

1052
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,920
over there. So over here. Now what

1053
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,400
happens? Let's build this burger. Get

1054
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,240
some cheese sauce on there. How about

1055
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,480
Yes. Okay. So here's the question.

1056
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,920
cheese sauce on the bun.

1057
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,520
I I like to char the bun, right? I'm

1058
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,520
going to say let's put the burger on

1059
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,079
there. That's why I wore gloves, you

1060
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,640
know? I didn't I don't want to burger. I

1061
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,720
feel some onions on the other side.

1062
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,880
Okay. Right. These are just charred with

1063
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,200
a little bit of vinegar. Need a little

1064
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,599
acidity. And not too heavy, doc. Right.

1065
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,280
Not breaded or anything. There's no

1066
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,560
There's no onion rings or anything, so

1067
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,680
that's good. Let me pour it. Let me pour

1068
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,000
it. Let me pour it. Let me pour it. Let

1069
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,839
me pour it. You can. You can get go

1070
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,960
right over the meat. Go, go, go. Pour it

1071
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,839
slow. Pour it slow.

1072
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,520
Yes. Oh,

1073
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,640
I have some y'all. X-rated dish today.

1074
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,680
All right, we're going to taste when we

1075
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,720
come back. You kept working. I'm going

1076
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,320
to get Well, you know what? You have

1077
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,760
that burger. Thank you. Up next, we're

1078
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,000
going to put Alex's burger to the test.

1079
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,240
Plus, a sweet makeover for a burger you

1080
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,079
have to see and taste to believe. Stick

1081
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,480
with us. What is this, though? I want

1082
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,320
the burger.

1083
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,040
The burger. Look at that. So beautiful.

1084
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,520
An unlicensed doctor. I went in to get

1085
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,280
my breath smaller. Scamming patients

1086
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,599
instead. What did he do to your body?

1087
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,240
Botching surgery. I went from a double D

1088
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,040
to an N.

1089
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,040
And how he took advantage with sex and

1090
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,610
drugs.

1091
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,160
That's coming up tomorrow.

[Applause]

1094
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,920
It is our burger bash. Alex just crafted

1095
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,000
this perfectly cheesy burger that looks

1096
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,760
like a dream come true. Are we Is

1097
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,119
everyone ready to give this a taste? You

1098
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,200
didn't wait for me. You went right into

1099
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,720
it. All right. And Alex, these are your

1100
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,240
onion rings that we've got. What is the

1101
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,839
secret to getting these crispy

1102
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,680
delightful onion? We'll take a bite and

1103
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,760
then we'll just eating them. This thing

1104
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,000
is really, really delicious. It fills

1105
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,079
your whole mouth. Cheesy. Yes, it tastes

1106
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,200
cheesy. And mustard. You got a little

1107
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,480
bit of mustard. You took the hamburger

1108
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,400
out of my mouth. All right. I do have

1109
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,560
one request. I need more cheese sauce on

1110
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,520
the side so I can dip my onion rings in

1111
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,560
there next time. Agree. Noted. I agree.

1112
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,240
Yeah. Both signs. Noted. So now, what if

1113
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,720
I told you people are actually eating

1114
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,440
burgers? Not just like we are the right

1115
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,040
way, but for dessert. It's not exactly

1116
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,560
what you're thinking. Okay, take a look

1117
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,000
