1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,600
Fast food pizza, a quick go-to meal, but

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,000
are some chains cutting corners where it

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,320
counts? Sort of like a biotech cheese

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,880
business here. And cold pizza. We love

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,040
it, but is it safe to eat? What the USDA

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,199
says is a 2-hour rule for any

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,680
potentially hazardous food. Plus chicken

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,080
flavorings. They recreated a simulated

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,480
version.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,080
>> A simulated version. How do they do it?

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,680
Now, that tastes like chicken. That's

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,680
amazing to me. Coming up next.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,600
Y'all ready for season 10?

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
>> Yeah.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,390
[Music]

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,530
>> I love you, Da.

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,530
[Music]

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,400
[Applause]

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,120
[Music]

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,360
every single second. An average of 350

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,359
pizza slices are sold in this country.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,000
Even champion pizza toggers like Nino

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,479
Caniglio. Oh my goodness. And then he

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
couldn't keep up. It's why the

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,320
modern-day giants of American pizza keep

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,479
finding ways to make this stuff faster,

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,960
cheaper, and cheesier. But are they

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,400
taking shortcuts? Right? They're cutting

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,920
corners that are putting our health in

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
jeopardy. And how are they able to sell

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
pizza so cheap anyway? Right? They're

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,759
less than five bucks a pie. Well, today

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,920
I'll be right back. We are investigating

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,400
fast food pizza from America's biggest

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,240
pizza chains. Scott Weiner is a

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,080
professional pizza enthusiast and he's

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,840
not only the foremost expert in pizza,

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,920
but he's also the Guinness World Record

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,640
holder for owning the most number of

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,720
pizza boxes.

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,759
Why would you even do that? Is that your

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
living room? Where is that?

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,640
>> Listen, I don't want to talk about the

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,040
collection is personal thing for me.

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,880
>> Personal thing. All right. So pizza uh

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
chains have dropped their prices so much

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,040
you start to wonder instead of cutting

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
triangles are they cutting corners?

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,720
>> You know, it's a good question because

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,200
the independent pizzeras can't compete

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,280
on price. They compete on quality. But

52
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,000
the big chains have to figure out how to

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,000
get people. So they they do it by buying

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,840
tons and tons of cheese, tons of flour,

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
and tons of sauce. So this way they can

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,479
charge way lower prices.

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,599
>> Let's investigate some of these

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,280
shortcuts. We'll start with the cheese.

59
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,920
Is that okay? That's a great place to

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,520
start because 40% of a pizza's food cost

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,599
is the cheese. So if you're going to

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,120
save money, that's how you do it.

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,720
>> So how would it used to be done in New

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
York? It's the mozzarella town.

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,480
>> Absolutely. Mozzarella is the absolute

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,520
number one pizza cheese in America, but

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
there are two different types of

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,720
mozzarella. This is kind of confusing.

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,400
Yeah. Yeah. Well, cuz you know, like the

70
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
normal standard pizza you get is covered

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
in cheese.

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,040
>> Yes, it is.

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,040
>> But a pizza margarita has these clumps

74
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,360
of brighter white cheese. That's fresh

75
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,360
mozzarella. And fresh mozzarella is when

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
you take curd from cow's milk or from

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,200
buffalo milk. You cook it down and you

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
stretch it, but it's a really high

79
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,640
hydration. There's a lot of water in it.

80
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,599
>> So that means that it shelf life is

81
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,519
pretty short.

82
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,040
>> So about 100 years ago, the dairy

83
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,879
industry started working on the shelf

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,519
life thing. And that's how we got this

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,000
low moisture mozzarella has lower than

86
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
52% water content. So that it means that

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,360
this cheese will last a lot longer

88
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,440
because it's just got less water in it.

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,599
But the issue is when you're using this

90
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,440
type of cheese in a big commercial

91
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,360
setting, you got to take this block of

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
cheese and you got to shred it down. So,

93
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,519
I mean, try shredding this cheese right

94
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,840
now. This is crazy labor intensive. It

95
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,800
takes forever. Certain stand mixers

96
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,879
started adding in cheese.

97
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,319
>> That's all I got for all that.

98
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,080
>> I honestly expect a little more from

99
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,800
you, doc, but I guess you're not a pizza

100
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,080
doctor. But listen, this type of thing,

101
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,920
we kind of got around this because

102
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
rather than shredding it yourself, the

103
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,879
pizza industry, or rather the cheese

104
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
industry, started working on

105
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,640
pre-shredded versions of it, which is

106
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,799
good cuz it saves on labor cost, but

107
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,879
it's not so great because if you leave

108
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,720
this stuff to itself, it starts to clump

109
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,519
up. So, they added in all these kind of

110
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,280
anti-caking agents like potato starch,

111
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,040
uh, calcium silicate, all this other

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,440
stuff, which prevents the cheese from

113
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,519
clumping up, and that results in more of

114
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,799
a greasy shine on top of your slice. See

115
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,480
all that shiny puddle of oil on top? You

116
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
know, this is this is fat from the

117
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
cheese. It's not all bad, but yeah, if

118
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,280
you do the blot test, I mean, a lot of

119
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,920
people eat their pizza like this.

120
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
>> Oh, no. And this is I thought this was

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
just fat coming out, but it's because

122
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,799
they have these different products in

123
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
there.

124
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,760
>> Some of it's fat coming out, but also

125
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,959
some of it is the residual from all

126
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,080
these anti-caking agents.

127
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
>> Look at that, guys.

128
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
>> And now your pizza tastes like a napkin.

129
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
>> Yes, your pizza tastes like a napkin.

130
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,519
>> I don't want to do that.

131
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,799
>> All right, so that's the first thing

132
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,000
cheeses. I understand now that the

133
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,840
industry got involved in this. All

134
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,680
right, second big issue. the cheesy

135
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,040
chain pizzas. They've got breads. You

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,400
often, you know, you get bread, right?

137
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,680
Bread with cheese when it comes with the

138
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
pizza. So, it's more bread and cheese

139
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,000
with the bread and cheese that's already

140
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,840
in the pizza.

141
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
>> Absolutely. I mean, and cheese is a

142
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,560
great part of a pizza. And it's

143
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,840
definitely the most exciting thing, you

144
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,759
know, like in the commercials, you

145
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,440
always see the chain pizza commercials

146
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,400
with that slice getting and you get the

147
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
cheese pull

148
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,560
>> breaking apart like this.

149
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,520
>> And it probably saved the dairy

150
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,040
industry. I bet

151
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
>> that it probably did because, you know,

152
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
about a year ago since the dairy

153
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,600
industry had this crazy issue with

154
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
overpopulation of dairy cheese. Uh the

155
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,080
US government started asking chain

156
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,639
pizzeras and other chain food companies

157
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,639
to start using more cheese. So one of

158
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,280
the big chains increased one of their

159
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,960
products cheese by 25%.

160
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,639
So this means that the dairy industry

161
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,919
might be saved a little bit by this, but

162
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,360
it also means that you're eating all

163
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,880
this extra cheese that you might not

164
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,199
need cuz I don't know about you, but I

165
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,880
think a good pizza is a balanced pizza,

166
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,639
not cheese. It just blows my mind to

167
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,880
think that there first of all that

168
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,800
cheese industry is being bolstered by

169
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,199
the pizza industry, but they would add

170
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
25% more. It does take the balance away.

171
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,160
>> It totally takes it away, but you know

172
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,720
what? It makes it look real good. And

173
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,000
cheese has a high perceived value. So

174
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,639
less cheese makes you think it's a

175
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,240
cheaper pizza.

176
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,759
>> All right, the next shortcut, it's a big

177
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,360
one, is the dough.

178
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,039
>> Yeah. I mean, look, dough is probably

179
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,880
the most significant part of a pizza

180
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,320
because all pizzas might not have

181
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,840
cheese, might not have sauce, but they

182
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
all have dough. And you only need four

183
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,560
ingredients for dough. water, flour,

184
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,400
yeast, and salt. And some of the

185
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,600
independents don't even use commercial

186
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,440
yeast if they're doing natural

187
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,280
fermentation. So the other end of the

188
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,520
spectrum with the big chains, some of

189
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,560
them are using all these kind of

190
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,319
oxidizers and strengtheners for dough.

191
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,919
And some of them are even not great for

192
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,919
you. Like there's one ingredient that's

193
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,400
in this pile over here, potassium

194
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,840
bromine, and that's an oxidizer. So it's

195
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,000
going to help the dough ferment faster

196
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,600
and trap more gas. But that's actually

197
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,199
on America's list of potential

198
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
carcinogens. and most other

199
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,080
>> on America's list.

200
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,759
>> Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's a type category 2B

201
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,840
carcinogen. And we're still allowed to

202
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,759
use it, but if you have too much of it

203
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,919
or if you underbake the pizza that has

204
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,199
it, it could be dangerous to you.

205
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,000
>> Do other countries have the same problem

206
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
with it?

207
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,360
>> Other countries have a huge problem.

208
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
It's not illegal in China. It's not

209
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,120
legal in Canada. It's It's illegal in

210
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
most places. It's not banned in the US

211
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,199
yet.

212
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,720
>> Oh my goodness. But there is some good

213
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,240
news. I understand because that chemical

214
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,520
you just mentioned earlier,

215
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,039
>> other changes are happening.

216
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,479
>> Yeah. At least one of the chains is

217
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,479
using a flower that doesn't have any

218
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,720
potassium bromate and their flour is

219
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,160
unbleached. So that's great.

220
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,759
>> Well, so the industry listens. If you

221
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,199
guys if you guys tell people what you

222
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
want, they'll actually come along with

223
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,759
it. All right. No one knows this better

224
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,080
than than Jino Kigla, who you saw

225
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,199
earlier spinning around the pizza dough.

226
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,039
10 time world pizza maker. He's a world

227
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,840
champion pizza maker from the Brooklyn

228
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,039
Pizza Crew. So what are the markers of a

229
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,639
good crust? Educate us. A great dough

230
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,360
is, you know, all about the

231
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,440
fermentation. So, you want to have, like

232
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,759
Scott was saying, a long fermentation.

233
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,280
Uh, the best is using like a poolish, a

234
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,880
bea, or wild starter culture. And it's

235
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,400
just going to make for a healthier bread

236
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,639
product. I think a lot of the problem

237
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,520
with the industry is is, you know,

238
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,319
they're not fermenting right, which is

239
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,000
making like stuff that's it's it's going

240
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
to fill you up. It's going to, you know

241
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,080
what I mean? Not break down, not digest

242
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
easily.

243
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,479
>> It smells so good already. You haven't

244
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,240
even cooked it yet.

245
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,880
>> Yeah, it's amazing. And it's, you know,

246
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,800
chalk full of uh probiotics, great

247
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,960
tomato sauce. Pizza simple. That's why

248
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Italian food's so popular. It's just

249
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
simple stuff.

250
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,319
Go.

251
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
>> And the secret to making a world class

252
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,599
is is just a couple ingredients done

253
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,080
right or is anything else special.

254
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,680
>> Yeah. I mean, that's it. Like as long as

255
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,440
the most important thing is fermenting

256
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,879
the dough uh properly and using that

257
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,199
because that's what's going to give you

258
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,599
a healthy really healthy pizza. I mean,

259
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,160
>> is this arugula? This is basil. Get that

260
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,800
basil on there.

261
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,800
>> Oh, I like that.

262
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,879
>> You're going I like green stuff. I like

263
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,199
the green stuff.

264
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,800
>> So,

265
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,080
>> all right. Now, we actually cooked this

266
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,599
one ahead of time. Go ahead and pull it

267
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,160
out. Who wants to taste a little pizza?

268
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,520
World class pizza.

269
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,479
>> All right. Let's just cut it up. Cut it

270
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,800
small. They believe me. They'll cut

271
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
they'll they'll eat your fingers off.

272
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
>> You You'll lose a couple here. We need

273
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,599
you to make more. How many pizzas you

274
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,159
make a day?

275
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,440
>> Uh about like two 300 a day.

276
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,399
>> Two 300. All right.

277
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,080
As we feed the audience up the next cold

everybody?

280

Everyone loves cold pizza. Is it a

282
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,320

It's good. Pizza's good. I love pizza.

310

What are you doing?

311
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,360
What are you doing? Who eats pizza this

early in the morning?

313
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,519
>> Yo, who cares? My body. I do what I

314
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,959
want.

315
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
>> So unhealthy, bro.

316
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,959

>> So gross.

321

>> Your own thing.

322

breakfast of champions and others call

325
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,320
it a ripe harvesting ground for

326
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,560
bacteria. So, what's the deal with cold

327
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,360
pizza? Is it safe to eat? And what's the

328
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,800
real reason it tastes so good to some

329
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,320
people, especially the next day?

330
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
Professional pizza enthusiast Scott

331
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
Weiner is back and he looked into the

332
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,000
science behind why the taste of pizza

333
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,600
can improve as it gets cold. So, what's

334
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,920
the deal? Why are people so obsessed

335
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,440
with cold pizza? Well, there's a couple

336
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,360
reasons. First of all, you know, you

337
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,360
have all these active aromatics like

338
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,800
garlic and onions and herbs and all

339
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,720
that. And you know how it is when you

340
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,880
make something fresh and something still

341
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,399
warm, those flavors all stand out pretty

342
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,760
independent from each other. But if you

343
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,760
give them time to meld, you know, like

344
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,079
day old lasagna tastes really good. So

345
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,680
good,

346
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,760
>> right? That's because those flavors tend

347
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,200
to mellow out and then they combine so

348
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,560
you get a little bit of a more mellowed

349
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,560
and mesh of a flavor. It's a little bit

350
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,040
more rich. But then we can't ignore the

351
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
fact that of course fat is flavor.

352
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,440
>> Yes.

353
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,240
>> And fat and water separate. So the oil,

354
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,160
the fat from this pizza all rises to the

355
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,600
top as it cools off. So when you take a

356
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,959
bite, you're actually going to get the

357
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,079
fat right on the roof of your mouth. So

358
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,360
you get that flavor first.

359
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,120
>> All right. So this explains why the cold

360
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,279
pizza tastes so good. But is it safe to

361
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,519
eat? My medical staff went inside our

362
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,519
pizza lab testing and experimenting with

363
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,680
how to store leftover pizza. They

364
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,360
chilled one pie in the fridge overnight

365
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,560
and the other one, well, we left it on

366
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,079
the counter, right? That happens

367
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,600
sometimes at home, too. Now, you can't

368
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,120
see them with the naked eye, but these

369
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,680
could be harboring some harmful

370
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,480
bacteria. To find out, I asked German

371
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,000
specialist Peter Deluchia to join us.

372
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,000
So, let's start off with the pizza we

373
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,680
put in the fridge last night. Last

374
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,959
night, pizza in the fridge last night

375
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,800
like it's supposed to be theoretically.

376
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,399
Is it safe to eat cold today? I love

377
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,240
cold pizza, so I'm not going to ruin it

378
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,640
for anybody. It is good to eat today. If

379
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,360
it's in the refrigerator, 40 degrees,

380
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,320
it's good for four days. So, here's the

381
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,000
reality, though. So many of us, we leave

382
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,680
the pizza on the counter overnight.

383
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,120
Doesn't make its way to the fridge,

384
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,279
right? Does that make sense if it's been

385
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,639
on the counter to eat? Well, you know,

386
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,440
you forget about it. You leave it out

387
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,440
there overnight. What the USDA says is a

388
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
2-hour rule for any potentially

389
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,720
hazardous food, and pizza is one of

390
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,320
them. Has to be put under refrigeration

391
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,279
at 40 degrees within two hours.

392
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,800
>> No one does that.

393
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,320
>> Well, I'll give you the big butt on this

394
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,760
one. So, I'm going to say, you know, but

395
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
in this case, first of all, health

396
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
department, we're not getting big pizza

397
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,880
complaints. We're not getting big pizza

398
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,560
outbreaks. It's not happening. We're not

399
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,000
getting those calls. Maybe we'll get a

400
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,200
call that someone finds a hair or

401
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
something else in their pizza that they

402
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,360
don't want, but it's not happening. So,

403
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,120
what I'm going to say is that it's, you

404
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
know, it's a it's a safe it's it's,

405
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,880
let's say, a semisafe thing to do. And

406
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,800
this is why. It's because of water

407
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,399
activity. Water activity is the big

408
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,079
issue. What do germs need to grow? They

409
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,920
need a good pH and water activity. And

410
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,959
when you're looking at baked bread,

411
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,240
baked cheese, add the acidity of a sauce

412
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,000
on there. It's really not the

413
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,000
environment where germs want to grow.

414
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,120
So, it makes that regular plain pie. I'm

415
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,040
going to say, you know what? Roll the

416
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,680
dice. Eat it in the morning. Odds are

417
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,200
you're going to be fine.

418
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,360
>> I was going to do it anyway, but so is

419
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,880
the entire audience. But let let's let's

420
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,800
you know let's go on to the next thing

421
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,240
is let's have toppings. People like to

422
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,639
have all these exotic pizzas and

423
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,480
toppings. You start adding chicken and

424
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,680
broccoli and fresh tomatoes and all

425
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,360
these different things. Now you're

426
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,680
making a much more potentially hazardous

427
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,120
pie. Don't forget to put that one in the

428
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,880
refrigerator or if you leave it out

429
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,079
overnight, you know, I say when in

430
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,000
doubt, throw it out.

431
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,399
>> So generally good news from the health

432
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,920
department.

433
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,279
>> Generally I try I don't want to make I

434
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,839
don't want I want to keep pizza good. I

435
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
love pizza.

436
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,800
>> All right. Here's the challenge though.

437
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,560
Does it still taste good? What's the

438
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,480
best way to store leftover pizza if you

439
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,480
can put it in the fridge? World champion

440
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,720
pizza maker Neo Kadigio is back in our

441
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,200
pizza lab to test two methods. Two

442
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,959
methods, everybody. Science meets

443
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,519
savory. So, do you like cold pizza, by

444
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,120
the way?

445
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,720
>> Yeah, cold pizza's all right once in a

446
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
while. I prefer the room temperature to

447
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
be honest with you.

448
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,920
>> Room temperature is okay.

449
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,360
>> Yeah, room temperature is nice. Out of

450
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
the oven, a little cool down. You know

451
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,399
what I'm saying?

452
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,240
>> All right, so we're going to explain how

453
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,680
you and my medical unit tested storage

454
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,680
methods. This is the stack and rack

455
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,279
technique or the other version, but

456
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,680
there they are very diligently doing it.

457
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,120
I just take a darn box, put the pizzas

458
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,040
inside of it, right? Throw it in the

459
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,720
fridge. This is what a lot of folks do.

460
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,160
Yeah, I would once again I wouldn't

461
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,000
recommend this. The oxygen's going to

462
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,920
get there. Your uh product's going to

463
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,360
become very hard. All right. It's not

464
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,959
going to be enjoyable the next day, but

465
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,320
you know, sometimes uh we don't feel

466
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,800
like wrapping stuff. So, we're all

467
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,680
guilty of it. But the stacking wrap is

468
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,880
definitely the way to go.

469
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,480
>> You think? Well, I'm going to put it to

470
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,000
the test cuz I've got our our bike club

471
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,000
here. They're tasting me coming over

472
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,839
here. you know, reheated the pizza that

473
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,440
we stored straight in the box and he

474
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,959
heated the pizza that was wrapped,

475
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
stacked and wrapped rather. Right. We're

476
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,440
gonna see if you guys can taste the

477
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
difference. So, Menel, you want to go

478
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,720
first?

479
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,920
>> Yeah. Okay. So, I definitely want to say

480
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,519
that this one was a little bit drier

481
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,360
than this one. I could definitely tell a

482
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,360
little bit of a difference. Not a huge,

483
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,800
but definitely the cheese in this one

484
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,720
just tasted richer and it just tasted

485
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,680
like if it was fresh instead of just

486
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,680
microwaved right away.

487
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,800
>> Were you happy with the red plate? Very

488
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
happy with this one. I'd rather choose

489
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
this one than that one.

490
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,760
>> Amanda.

491
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,079
>> Yeah, I agree. This one was definitely

492
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,760
more crumbly. This one tasted a lot

493
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,279
fresher, more It was moistister.

494
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,600
>> So, you're a red plate person, too.

495
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,079
>> Yeah.

496
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,160
>> And guess what? The red plate was the

497
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,000
wrap, the sacked wrap. It actually seems

498
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,399
to pay off. But here's the thing. I

499
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,639
didn't know till just before this show.

500
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,199
>> How do you actually reheat pizza? How

501
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,199
many of you microwave your pizza? Oh,

502
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
>> bad, bad mistake.

503
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,519
>> Real bad.

504
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,040
>> Real bad. Right. What's the way to do

505
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,800
it? Is it putting it in the oven?

506
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,560
>> Putting it in the oven is a good way to

507
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,680
do it, but what we really prefer, what

508
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,680
most pizza guys prefer to do is to get

509
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,000
it in a hot pan. All right. I like to

510
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,440
put a top over it and just fry it up a

511
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
little bit. It takes about like one or

512
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
two minutes.

513
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,360
>> All the pizza guys are doing that. And

514
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,360
you know, no one ever told us. The

515
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,660
secret is out. Guys, thanks for joining.

516
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,240
Be right back.

517
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,120
[Music]

518
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,959
>> Love your chips and dip? We have a guac

519
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,639
shock. If you're buying pre-made from

520
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,480
the store, how do the companies get away

521
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,959
with that? You may be getting more in

522
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,199
your supermarket salsa than you think.

523
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,320
All new Oas. That's coming up on

524
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,510
Wednesday.

[Applause]

527
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
We've been investigating some of your

528
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,880
favorite weekn night meals. Now, the

529
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,399
crowd-pleasing side dishes that know you

530
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
all love because they save you time,

531
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,600
money, and they taste so darn good. Rice

532
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,839
and couscous and pasta with, of course,

533
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,000
chicken flavor. But did you ever stop

534
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,920
and wonder, is there any real chicken in

535
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,720
there at all? And what exactly does

536
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,399
chicken flavor really mean? Well, Mark

537
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,000
Shasker wrote a book called The Dorito

538
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,920
Effect, which remains one of the most

539
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,160
surprising windows into how the food

540
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,240
industry develops flavors in a lab that

541
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,440
keeps us wanting more. So, how what do

542
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,759
we know about how they actually make

543
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,480
these fake copies taste even better than

544
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,680
the real thing?

545
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,680
>> Yeah. So, when I was researching the

546
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,199
Dorito effect, I contacted a flavor

547
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,199
company and they told me the whole

548
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,959
story. They had just released a new line

549
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,320
of chicken flavors. And the way they

550
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,079
made this is they got a whole bunch of

551
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,759
super high-end chefs in Europe to get

552
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,679
the best pastured chickens they could

553
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,120
find and make the most wonderful chicken

554
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,799
broth they could find. And then they

555
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,480
took those broths and they chemically

556
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,160
analyzed them. They figured out what are

557
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,559
the flavor compounds in that broth. Then

558
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,919
they recreated a simulated version. So

559
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,760
here's what happened. Mark hit the road

560
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,679
to get some answers. He visited a

561
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,520
chicken farm and he asked, "Why doesn't

562
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,959
chicken taste like it used to?" Isn't

563
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,679
that your all your question? What

564
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,919
happened to our chicken? Take a look.

565
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,559
Chicken these days doesn't taste the way

566
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,320
it used to. Question is why? What

567
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,520
happened to chicken? Why does it taste

568
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,919
so bland?

569
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,840
>> To find out, I headed to a 200 acre farm

570
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,320
in Indiana run by my friend Pete

571
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,799
Echelman.

572
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,280
>> How you doing?

573
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,000
>> Good to see you.

574
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,919
>> Yeah, great.

575
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,760
>> Okay, Pete, tell me, why doesn't chicken

576
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,840
taste the way it used to? When I buy

577
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,919
chicken, it is the blandest meat. It

578
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,480
tastes like wet paper towel. What What's

579
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,400
going on?

580
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,760
>> Simply chickens are not raised like

581
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,160
this. They're out uh all natural on

582
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,600
grass eating bugs. They're harvested

583
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,640
around 14 16 weeks versus 6 weeks.

584
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,720
That's the difference.

585
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,039
>> So you're you're saying the fact that

586
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,440
these chickens live outside on pasture

587
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,840
eating this stuff and they grow more

588
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,600
slowly that makes them taste better.

589
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,520
>> Absolutely.

590
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,559
>> So if most chickens today don't live on

591
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,400
farms like Pete's where do they live? I

592
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,200
set off to find a modern-day chicken

593
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,760
farm. There's one, but it looks more

594
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,760
like a factory than it does a farm. And

595
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,320
something tells me it's not open for

596
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,120
tours. Inside, there may be as many as

597
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,600
25,000 birds. And they spend their

598
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,240
entire lives not doing much of anything

599
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,880
other than eating. But just what are

600
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,440
they eating? To find out, I'm going to

601
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,679
check out this local feed store. Tell

602
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,200
me, what's in modern-day chicken feed?

603
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,600
Basically, you add corn for your

604
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,520
calories here, soybean meal for protein,

605
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,160
and then the vitamins and trace mineral

606
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,919
mix.

607
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,919
>> So, would you say then that this food is

608
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,720
designed to make chickens grow big and

609
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,440
fast?

610
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,280
>> Basically, the the diet is always

611
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
designed, I would say, for chickens to

612
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,080
grow faster.

613
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,559
>> You've heard the expression, you are

614
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,400
what you eat. What about chickens? Well,

615
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,080
there's some debate on this, but certain

616
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,080
scientific studies show that the flavor

617
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,320
of chicken is influenced by what

618
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,280
chickens eat. And if chickens grow up

619
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,679
never eating bugs or grass and only ever

620
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,320
eating bland feed made from corn and

621
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,000
soybeans, that's how the chickens taste.

622
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,400
Bland.

623
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,520
I had one more stop to make to find out

624
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
why chicken these days tastes so boring.

625
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,039
>> Greg.

626
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
>> Hi, Mark.

627
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,120
>> Greg Gunthorp runs a chicken processing

628
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,559
plant that supplies some of Chicago's

629
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,080
best chefs.

630
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,320
>> So, Greg, if I think chicken tastes like

631
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,240
tap water, it's not my imagination.

632
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,720
>> It's not your imagination at all. Most

633
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,799
commercial chicken is soaked in bleach

634
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,840
water for about 90 minutes in a large

635
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,520
automated chiller.

636
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,679
>> And how does that affect the flavor?

637
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,720
>> Washes out a lot of the flavor. To

638
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,120
maintain flavor, Greg avoids water.

639
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,960
Instead, he air chills his chickens

640
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,720
inside this refrigerator.

641
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
>> These chickens when they cool like this

642
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,640
in a fridge, they taste better. They

643
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
taste less watery, I'm guessing.

644
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,000
>> Yeah. They're, you know, the you can

645
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,760
wash some of the flavor out by chilling

646
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,360
them in water. It would be like taking a

647
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,160
ham sandwich and dunking it in water.

648
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,200
>> Right. Exactly.

649
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,120
>> Yeah.

650
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,240
>> All this talk of bland chicken was

651
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,480
making me hungry for the real thing. So,

652
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,880
I decided to go back to Pete's Farm to

653
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,039
see what a slow growing, pasture-raised,

654
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,360
air chilled chicken actually tastes

655
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,520
like.

656
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,790
>> This is the moment of truth to try my

657
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,859
chicken.

658
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,859
[Music]

659
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,720
Oh my god, it actually tastes like

660
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,919
chicken.

661
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,520
>> Here's what I take away from that.

662
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,520
Instead of using real chickens to give

663
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,600
us chicken flavor, the food industry has

664
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,039
turned to science. So, here's how

665
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,640
chicken flavor is often made. I just

666
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,000
take what Mark taught me and put it in

667
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,200
some pictures for you. First off, they

668
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,320
don't start with chickens. So, get rid

669
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,679
of the chickens. There's no chickens in

670
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,960
this thing. Instead, they start with

671
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,880
boiling soybean meal. Soybean meal,

672
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
right? They do this in large vats of

673
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,320
hydrochloric acid and they leave it in

674
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,000
there for about six hours. It's

675
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,919
basically a chemistry lab that that

676
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,919
wrenches apart the protein molecules and

677
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,919
turns them into amino acids, things that

678
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,360
Mark was talking about. Corn syrup can

679
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,280
then be added to the mix for an even

680
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,600
more intense browning flavor. Then the

681
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,039
solution is neutralized with sodium

682
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,960
hydroxide. Why am I telling you all

683
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,480
that? Because sodium hydroxide, sodium

684
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,559
salt, right? It leaves the product with

685
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
an abundance of salt and then it tastes

686
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,640
like chicken when they're done. Go

687
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,240
figure. But it's never ever had a

688
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,640
feather and it definitely never lived on

689
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,559
Old McDonald's farm. I just want you to

690
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,760
be clear on that. But now first, I mean

691
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,760
a bunch of questions come to mind, Mark,

692
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,280
but first, how did anyone ever discover

693
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
this? Who who have put the pieces

694
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,840
together and thought they could make

695
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
something chemical that tasted like

696
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,919
chicken?

697
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,440
>> Well, like I said, you know, they've got

698
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,520
very sophisticated equipment. They can

699
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
analyze the the chem the flavor

700
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,559
chemicals in actual chicken. They don't

701
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,760
bother with the nutrition. It's not

702
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,120
about the protein. It's not about the

703
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,320
vitamins. It's just about the flavor.

704
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,520
And they recreate that.

705
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,720
>> Are you worried about these flavorings?

706
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,159
Do you think they're dangerous at all?

707
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,760
>> So, a lot of people ask me, are these

708
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,039
toxic? Are they going to give me cancer?

709
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,400
That's always the big worry. Is it going

710
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,039
to give me cancer? I don't think that's

711
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,880
a danger here. What is the danger is

712
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,640
that this is the stuff that makes food

713
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,240
delicious and it keeps us going back and

714
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,600
back and back. And let's face it, our

715
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,760
big problem when it comes to food is

716
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,400
eating too much. I would say if you're

717
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,440
looking for flavor, go to nature. Use

718
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,360
herbs, use spices, use parmesan cheese.

719
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,200
Nature does not have a flavor problem.

720
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,960
The processed food industry does. On

721
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,360
that note, if you want savory,

722

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,840
I love getting to talk with you on my

731
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,000
show every single day. But when the

732
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,320
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

733
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,720
is not over. I still have a lot that I

734
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,360
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

[Applause]

738
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,880
Are you obsessed with the taste of box

739
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,400
side dishes but don't want all the added

740
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,400
chemicals and the salt? Well, there's

741
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,720
good news today cuz Chef Dicky Dinky is

742
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,720
breaking all the flavor rules down to

743
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,320
revealing three all naturatural tricks

744
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,559
for tastier side dishes that are going

745
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,760
to blow your mind. All right, so we're

746
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,360
going to put Nikki's new side dish

747
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,600
solutions to the test. To do that, we

748
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,440
assembled a team of crack tasters who

749
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,720
are obsessed with the box stuff. They're

750
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,120
going to give us their honest opinions

751
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,400
on how naturally flavored sides stack

752
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
up. Are you ready to do that?

753
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,919
>> Yeah.

754
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,520
>> All right. Here goes. First up, we're

755
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,640
going to add salsa to your water. And

756
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,039
then you're going to boil the food in

757
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,200
there.

758
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,760
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm going to boil my

759
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,080
rice in a mixture of half salsa, half

760
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,919
water. And what this is going to do Oh,

761
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,760
feel free. Um, what this is going to do

762
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,480
is it's going to put that salsa flavor

763
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,960
directly into our rice and give it great

764
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,960
color. So, if you're making rice for say

765
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,960
a big Mexican feast, you've got some

766
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,400
tacos, this is a great side dish.

767
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,320
>> All right, Kayan, you've been tasting

768
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,320
this whole time. Please compare this to

769
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,039
the usual box product you eat.

770
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,280
>> Wow. This is fresh and flavorful. It's

771
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,799
definitely not as overpowering and salty

772
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,640
like the box stuff.

773
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,600
>> It's really great.

774
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,679
>> That's a winner.

775
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,279
>> It's great. We love salsa. Put that in

776
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,880
our buns. I didn't think you could boil

777
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,480
the sauce. I thought you'd mess it up.

778
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,520
>> No. People are so afraid of messing

779
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
things up. Sometimes we don't take

780
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,200
chances. And that's one that you want to

781
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,000
take.

782
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,480
>> All right. Next up, we're going to

783
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,840
replace the butter or your oil with

784
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
schmaltz cubes.

785
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,880
>> Yeah,

786
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,919
>> schmaltz. It's a word. I looked it up.

787
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,480
What does schmaltz mean?

788
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,159
>> So schmaltz is just chicken fat. So

789
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,559
anytime that I cook up, say chicken

790
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,799
thighs or skin on chicken breast, that

791
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,039
fat that renders into the pan, I save it

792
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,520
just like you see here. And then I just

793
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,760
scoop it into an ice cube tray. And you

794
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,000
can see it's got all that great gelatin.

795
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,080
And what this does is it adds intense

796
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,279
chicken flavor to your dish. And it's

797
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,760
one of those things that you would have

798
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,880
otherwise thrown away. So it's free and

799
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,679
we're going to have it on hand because

800
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,200
we're freezing it.

801
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,039
>> I think it's brilliant. I used to always

802
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,600
get upset throwing this away. No more.

803
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,600
So

804
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,480
>> once you freeze it, it looks like this.

805
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
>> You pop it open.

806
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,159
>> Yeah.

807
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,880
>> Like that. And you take these little

808
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,799
babies.

809
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,400
>> Put it right in your finished couscous

810
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,480
or whatever kind of grain you have

811
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,960
instead of say a pad of butter. And that

812
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,279
chicken flavor will perfume the dish and

813
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,080
it just adds this lusciousness, this

814
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,679
richness. You can smell it. It's great.

815
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,360
>> She perfumes it. I love it.

816
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,919
>> Perfumes it. Who doesn't want chicken

817
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,480
perfume?

818
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,320
>> I want So Maria, would you perfume with

819
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,000
schmaltz your couscous?

820
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,880
>> Absolutely. Well, Dr. Oz, admittedly, I

821
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,799
am a horrible cook. And when I use

822
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,200
anything, it's very bland and it's very

823
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,799
dry, but this was very flavorful. It was

824
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,440
very rich and creamy. So, I certainly do

825
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,120
have an appreciation.

826
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,559
>> It's mana from heaven. Yeah,

827
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,320
>> I like it.

828
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,000
>> Finally, we're going to cook your grains

829
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,480
in orange juice. Now, the first two I

830
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,559
sort of got. I This thing seemed crazy.

831
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,960
>> Uh, it's a little crazy, but crazy in a

832
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,520
great way. So, we are simply replacing

833
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,159
your boiling water with orange juice. In

834
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,679
this case, we did some uh quinoa. It's

835
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,760
got a little sesame oil, a little

836
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,679
scallions. Not many ingredients here,

837
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,679
but because the grain is so flavorful,

838
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,120
the whole dish just sings. Not many

839
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,679
greens, but the name, think about this,

840
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,720
orange juice infused quinoa with some

841
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,559
sesame oil.

842
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,520
>> Some adjectives, please. Princess,

843
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,440
>> it was definitely tangy, very tasteful,

844
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,799
savory. I really enjoyed it.

845
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,919
>> I like the ginger. It's my favorite.

846
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,279
>> Yeah, a little bit of spice.

847
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,960
>> All right, I want to thank Chef Nikki

848
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,320
Dinky. Her book is called The Meat.

849
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
Actually, just meat on the side.

850
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:27,400
>> Just meat on the side. You can all at

851
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,400

852

853
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,679
Love your chips and dip. We have a guac

854
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,200
shock. If you're buying pre-made from

855
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,039
the store, how do companies get away

856
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,840
with selling guacamole doesn't have real

857
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,360
avocados in it?

858
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,279
>> And you may be getting more in your

859
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,520
supermarket salsa than you think.

860
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,240
>> Sugar, sugar, sugar. Oh gosh.

861
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,380
>> All new OS. That's coming up on

862
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,870

For those of you in pain, I get it.

866
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,840
You're desperate for fast relief to an

867
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,600
aching back or sore muscles.

868
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,000
Over-the-counter pain relieving creams

869
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,760
and lotions may seem like a safer choice

870
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,159
than taking a pill. But can those

871
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,080
numbing ointments that you're using be

872
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,640
addicting? Today we investigate pain

873
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,240
relief cream confessions. Can you be

874
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,360
overusing these over-the-counter

875
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,919
solutions or worse overdose on pain

876
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,919
relieving creams?

877
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,159
I keep my pain relief cream with me

878
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,960
every day all day. I keep one in my

879
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,279
purse. I keep one in my car. I even keep

880
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,080
one at my desk at work. It's essential

881
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,640
that I have my pain relief cream with me

882
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,720
every day for my chronic back pain. I

883
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,159
need my pain relief cream. I use it so

884
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,039
much even my husband tries to hide it

885
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,880
from me. I rely on pain relief cream.

886
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,600
It's my security blanket to get through

887
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,919
the day.

888
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,840
>> I love my pain relief cream. I use it

889
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,840
every day, even more than normal lotion.

Pain specialist and anesthesiologist Dr.

Gupta is here to help investigate pain

893
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,559
cream addiction. What kinds of pain

894
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,240
relief creams are people using,

895
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,720
overusing, maybe even getting addicted

896
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,960
to?

897
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,640
>> Dr. Oz, there are so many pain creams at

898
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,360
the pharmacy right now. And this is the

899
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,520
issue. People find them very easily.

900
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,840
There are tubes, there's gels, and there

901
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
patches, and people want to take them

902
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,520
right now. They don't want to take

903
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,720
pills. Um, they're fast, they're easy,

904
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,640
and you can get them without a

905
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,320
prescription. And they think they're

906
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,960
safe. And that's why we're here today to

907
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
talk about them.

908
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,159
>> All right. So, let's talk about what's

909
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,720
specifically in them that might be

910
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,080
addictive.

911
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,559
>> That's right. That's right. So, there's

912
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,240
many ingredients. Menthol is one of the

913
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,159
most common that you'll hear about and

914
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,760
that gives you the cool sensation that

915
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,399
you when you apply on you feel good

916
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,159
about that. Also, camper oil, very

917
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,159
traditional type of medication that

918
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,039
you'll find in many countries. Uh, it's

919
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,679
an essential oil. Eucalyptus from a

920
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,360
tree. Uh, and also menthol salicellate.

921
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,120
Now, that is one that we have to be

922
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,360
concerned about. When you use a lot of

923
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,039
it, that's when we can run into trouble

924
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,159
and it can actually be toxic,

925
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,360
>> right? So, what's the amount that you're

926
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,880
supposed to use? How do you know when

927
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,720
you're using it more often than you're

928
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,960
supposed to? Give me some of the the

929
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,240
rational guidelines from from an expert.

930
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,840
>> And that's and that's what we really

931
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,080
need to be worried about. Um, you know,

932
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,760
look, as a doctor, a pain doctor, we

933
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,240
really have to be concerned here. Three

934
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,640
to four times a day, no more than seven

935
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,080
days.

936
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,960
>> Right. So I I'm interested. You say

937
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,640
three to four times a day for a week and

938
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,200
after that you got to talk to somebody.

939
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,480
>> That's right.

940
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
>> Let's go talk to Kimberly. She's going

941
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,760
to be one of our audience member. She

942
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,399
uses a cream five times a day.

943
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,880
>> Hello.

944
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,320
>> Thanks for being here. And five times a

945
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,919
day, which is I didn't think was an

946
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,120
unusual amount. And when I hurt myself,

947
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,799
that's probably what I would probably

948
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,880
do. Explain how you first learned about

949
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,000
these creams and how you've built up to

950
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,520
five times a day.

951
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,520
>> About seven years ago, I ran my first

952
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,039
half marathon. Um I noticed my knee

953
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,720
started hurting during the race, so I

954
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,679
stopped at the medical tent. It was the

955
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,679
first time um they lthered me up and I

956
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,760
continued the race and after that it

957
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,520
just became

958
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,520
every day I started using it so I could

959
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,919
run and and I got into CrossFit and

960
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,360
that's

961
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,480
>> this is exactly what I often hear. It

962
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
starts with once or twice you get

963
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,000
introduced to it and it does sound like

964
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,760
other types of addictions. You slowly

965
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,440
building up more and more and more. So

966
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,840
Dr. Gupta, what's actually happening?

967
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,360
>> Look what she's experienc Kimberly's

968
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,360
experience is the common thing that I

969
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,120
hear in my office. The most important

970
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,360
thing here is that we have to remember

971
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,279
drugs are drugs. You have to remember

972
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,960
that if you use too much of it, you're

973
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,320
going to run into trouble and harm can

974
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,799
happen. And we're going to talk about

975
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,399
that.

976
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,000
>> More is not better. Even though this is

977
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,880
America, there's a rational amount.

978
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,320
Here's a picture of a burn that could

979
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,679
happen after using too much of these

980
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,640
creams. That's actually what happened to

981
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,320
this patient.

982
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,480
>> And there was one case, Dr. of an

983
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,320
overdose in a teen who used too much of

984
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,760
a pain relieving cream. Mhm.

985
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,840
>> I I don't know how much they were using,

986
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,200
but they had a pretty benign problem,

987
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,559
but it ended up becoming

988
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
>> a lethal complication.

989
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,080
>> Right.

990
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
>> Let's come on over, Elizabeth. Have a

991
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,960
seat in that chair because I've got a

992
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,360
surprise for you in a second. Dr. going

993
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,960
to show you why that the heating pad is

994
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,480
such an issue here. I never thought

995
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,840
heating pads and creams would ever

996
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,720
interact with each other. Never crossed

997
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,440
my mind. I thought you're supposed to

998
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,000
use them together.

999
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,840
>> That's right.

1000
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,600
>> Your skin, this is what it represents,

1001
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,080
right? Has little pores in there. And

1002
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,399
when you add a pain relieving cream, in

1003
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,480
theory, these little pellets of pain

1004
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,559
relief go through the hole and you're

1005
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,320
good to go. When you put a heating pad

1006
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,240
on your skin, what happens to the pores?

1007
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,880
>> So, the pores get bigger. And this is

1008
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,799
the problem.

1009
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,200
>> So, as the pores get bigger, now let's

1010
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,360
both add a handful of cream, right? And

1011
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,640
as we do that, you'll notice mine don't

1012
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,720
all go in. They're sort of sitting on

1013
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,399
the surface, whereas yours are falling

1014
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,679
in there pretty readily. In fact, hers

1015
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,600
is so big, I could probably just pour

1016
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,799
this straight in there, right? And if

1017
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,880
you look at the amount that's actually

1018
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,720
getting into the skin, it's dramatically

1019
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,880
different. You're you're absorbing the

1020
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,120
active ingredient at a different rate.

1021
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,159
And that can result in symptoms which

1022
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,919
lead to confusion, vomiting, headache,

1023
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,200
you know, nausea, complications that you

1024
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,399
never could think could be associated

1025
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,960
with a pain relief cream.

1026
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,000
>> That's right.

1027
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,519
>> So instead of using a heating pad plus a

1028
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,120
cream or but if you are going to do

1029
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,760
this, this is not irrational. How often

1030
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,600
would you do it?

1031
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,120
>> Look, you have to be careful. uh heating

1032
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,360
pads have the risks that we just talked

1033
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,960
about, but very cautiously and talk to

1034
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,519
your doctor. I mean, I would tell my

1035
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,360
patients to avoid combining these type

1036
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,120
of treatments together and people still

1037
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,240
do it, but talk to your doctor if you're

1038
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,480
going to do all these things together at

1039
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,200
once.

1040
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
>> All right, let's talk about something

1041
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,000
simple like knee pain. Let's say you

1042
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,120
have knee pain because you're trying to

1043
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
do the right thing for your body.

1044
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,279
>> That's right. That's right.

1045
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,640
>> Kimberly wants to put the cream on

1046
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,159
there, but since you're a pain

1047
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,519
specialist, teach us what else might be

1048
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,919
causing the pain. Let's deal with the

1049
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,000
root issue, not cover up, paint over the

1050
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,440
cracks in the foundation of our health.

1051
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,360
There are things that you can do at

1052
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,679
home. So, one thing you can do is have

1053
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,760
an upright back in a chair, cross your

1054
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,279
legs over your knee. Um, what I can do,

1055
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,960
take your leg, and what I'm going to

1056
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,880
have you do is place this knee actually

1057
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,559
right here and this. And I'm going to

1058
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,640
have you straighten this leg and then

1059
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,320
lean forward. And then I'm going to have

1060
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,559
you put your hands over this knee right

1061
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,559
here. Both hands like this. And now I

1062
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,640
want you to lean towards this hand. Lean

1063
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,919
and actually cross your back. And do you

1064
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,360
feel that stretch in your back?

1065
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,440
>> Very much. And so you're going to feel

1066
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,679
it in your back and in your hamstring

1067
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,360
and in something called a purformis. And

1068
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,960
this muscle, if you do alternating

1069
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,880
repetitions, actually can actually

1070
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,559
stretch most multiple muscles, not only

1071
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,480
your back, but your hamstrings and your

1072
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,720
knee. And this is an exercise that I'll

1073
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,159
recommend to my patients very frequently

1074
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,080
just in the office, whether you're an

1075
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,240
athlete, whether you're someone that has

1076
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,679
back pain or knee pain, very effective.

1077
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,640
>> It's a much more holistic approach. I

1078
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,240
hope that's helpful to you. Keep

1079
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,399
running. Absolutely. All right, we'll be

1080
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,399
right back.

1081
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,399
The Atlanta child murders.

1082
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,679
>> Most of the people did not believe that

1083
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,159
Wayne was the killer.

1084
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,960
>> A victim's brother reveals what some

1085
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,039
won't believe.

1086
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,600
>> I was there. I saw this guy.

1087
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,760
>> Plus, actor singer Donnie Wahlberg

1088
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,480
shares chilling details about Charles

1089
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,440
Manson.

1090
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,440
That's coming up tomorrow.

1091
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,039
[Music]

1092
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,640
One thing I loved about visiting China

1093
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,880
with my trusted sponsorship partner,

1094
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,640
USANA Health Sciences, was the ability

1095
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,399
to explore how traditional Chinese

1096
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,640
medicine and conventional western

1097
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,880
medicine work together. They each have

1098
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,200
so much to offer. But how do you decide

1099
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:02,519
when to incorporate an ancient practice

1100
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,519
into your life today? We'll take a look.

1101
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,279
Beijing is fast-paced and fast growing.

1102
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,960
A city that radiates hope and

1103
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,679
prosperity.

1104
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,599
The best part, the people. Wherever we

1105
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,679
went, we were greeted with tremendous

1106
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,320
enthusiasm.

1107
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,879
Another joy of this journey, the food. I

1108
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,440
sampled exotic snacks by day, and on my

1109
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,520
first night, an extraordinary classic,

1110
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,919
Peeking Duck.

1111
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,320
The next day, a stiff neck I developed

1112
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:32,399
during the flight was getting worse. But

1113
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,320
I was in China, where the approach to

1114
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,480
medicine often blends the latest and

1115
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,119
high-tech without casting off what's

1116
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,399
worked over time. I was game to give the

1117
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,159
age-old methods a try. At the Dau

1118
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,839
Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic,

1119
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,399
some of the practices date back

1120
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,399
thousands of years, but are they still

1121
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,399
relevant?

1122
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,159
>> Chinese medical doctors are very

1123
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,640
important in China. Currently, we are

1124
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,800
confronting a lot of challenges such as

1125
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,200
drugresistant viruses and chronic

1126
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,680
diseases. Therefore, we value

1127
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,760
traditional Chinese medicine even more.

1128
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,400
>> How does traditional Chinese medicine

1129
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,760
differ from Western medicine?

1130
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,920
>> The biggest difference between

1131
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,280
traditional Chinese medicine and Western

1132
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,280
medicine is their different worldviews.

1133
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,680
One way to look at it is that

1134
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,400
traditional Chinese medicine takes a

1135
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,119
holistic approach to health centering on

1136
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,280
balance and energy flow orqi while

1137
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,960
western medicine focuses on curing

1138
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,560
disease. And if you have a patient, how

1139
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,240
do how do you decide if they should get

1140
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,800
traditional Chinese medicine or if they

1141
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,079
should get western medicine?

1142
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,839
>> The difference between them is that

1143
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,560
western medicine is more suitable for

1144
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,119
certain diseases.

1145
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,359
>> For example, pneumonia.

1146
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,839
Administering antibiotics can result in

1147
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,240
a speedy recovery.

1148
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,079
>> Other complicated chronic diseases may

1149
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,880
require treatment using traditional

1150
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,800
Chinese medicine.

1151
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,800
One of the most fascinating aspects of

1152
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,440
traditional Chinese medicine is the use

1153
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,040
of herbs. I watched what is essentially

1154
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,720
a traditional Chinese medicine

1155
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,160
pharmacist prepare a prescription.

1156
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,680
I mean, look at this. There's so many

1157
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,599
herbs here. They're all so different.

1158
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,520
How many herbs are there in traditional

1159
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,920
Chinese medicine?

1160
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,160
>> There are more than 10,000 of them.

1161
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,560
There are about 450 that are commonly

1162
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,200
used. And what's the most common

1163
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,800
solution? What problem do you solve?

1164
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,839
>> Some of the common ones are used to

1165
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,480
treat colds.

1166
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,240
>> It was time for me to be the patient.

1167
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,240
So, I'm with Dr. Pong. He's helping me

1168
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,359
with this neck pain I've had since

1169
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,160
flying to China.

1170
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,320
>> Dr. Pong will use moxabustion where an

1171
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,119
herb is burned over certain areas of the

1172
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,880
body to facilitate healing.

1173
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,599
>> It's warmer than a heating pad would be

1174
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,720
and more intense. Dr. Can you explain

1175
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,720
what you're doing?

1176
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,440
>> Well, in traditional Chinese medicine,

1177
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,440
the pain point is called ashra.

1178
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,520
Through the stimulation of that point,

1179
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,800
we can promote the relaxation of the

1180
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,800
muscles and the pain will dissipate.

1181
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,400
has a powerful smell. Oo,

1182
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,079
it's like a an incense. What What does

1183
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,560
it smell from? Oh my goodness. You're

1184
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,880
getting it.

1185
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,560
>> This is mugwart leaf.

1186
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,560
>> The session lasted about 11 minutes.

1187
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,400
>> Does it still hurt?

1188
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,040
>> It's amazing. I mean, it has been

1189
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,200
non-stop aching for 3 days. I mean, it

1190
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,119
doesn't hurt at all.

1191
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,680
That's remarkable.

1192
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,680
Who would have thought?

1193
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,860
[Music]

1194
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:54,720
I have witnessed in China a unique blend

1195
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,800
of ancient and modern and a people open

1196
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,720
to both who do their homework and hold

1197
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,640
on to what works, learning from the past

1198
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,400
to help shape the future. I know that

1199
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,880
USANA Health Sciences Chief Science

1200
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,960
Officer Dr. Robert Senate also shares in

1201
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,000
this belief. What kinds of ideas has

1202
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,200
USANA adopted from past eastern

1203
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,599
philosophies?

1204
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,200
>> Well, we've adopted a very holistic uh

1205
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,680
approach towards health which comes from

1206
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,240
Eastern medicine. But holistic means

1207
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,920
that we pay attention to the body, the

1208
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,480
spirit, the whole the whole person

1209
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,200
rather than just organs and cells within

1210
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,400
their body.

1211
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,680
>> We're not just a bunch of molecules.

1212
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,040
We're actually connected in ways that

1213
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,560
are special, unique.

1214
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,480
>> Exactly. In ways we don't even

1215
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,720
understand yet. So scientists often

1216
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,839
infuse eastern knowledge into modern

1217
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
supplements that are being created

1218
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,880
today. It's happening all over the

1219
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,480
place, but it's especially evident when

1220
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,320
we try to take care of ourselves. So Dr.

1221
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,760
Sen, walk us through some of the the

1222
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,280
traditional ingredients that you that

1223
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,960
you're seeing out there, especially the

1224
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,839
ones that USANA is starting to use in

1225
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,520
his supplements.

1226
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,040
>> Okay, so we actually share quite a few

1227
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,119
ingredients in common with traditional

1228
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,240
Chinese medicine. We use certain

1229
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,680
mushrooms such as rayi and shiakei. uh

1230
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,359
they've got polysaccharides that

1231
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,680
stimulate the immune system and help

1232
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,560
your body uh fight against um things

1233
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,720
that are invaders. We also use a form of

1234
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,160
baker's yeast called beta glucan. So

1235
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,839
it's the cell walls from the baker's

1236
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,079
yeast that stimulates the immune system

1237
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,000
and keeps it modulated. And then we also

1238
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,119
use the mineral zinc quite a bit because

1239
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,800
zinc is a micronutrient that your body

1240
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,560
needs actually increased amounts when

1241
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,079
you're under stress and when you're

1242
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,040
exposed to things that you shouldn't be

1243
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,720
exposed to. It's remarkable to me that

1244
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,800
traditional Chinese medicine figured a

1245
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,320
lot of this stuff out thousand plus

1246
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,440
years ago. I mean, imagine walking

1247
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,800
through the forest and seeing this.

1248
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,280
Look, it looks like a piece of art.

1249
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,560
>> Yeah.

1250
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,640
>> You just come in close on these. Look

1251
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,240
how pretty those are. Then understanding

1252
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,440
exactly how these might work. I'm

1253
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,119
stunned. For example, the baker's yeast.

1254
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,880
It makes sense, right? If you showed me

1255
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,480
the wall of a bacteria that could have

1256
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,839
been invading me, of course, I'm going

1257
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,760
to think it's a bad thing that I want to

1258
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,400
knock out. So since there's no bacteria

1259
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,839
there, I just get my my tentacles go up

1260
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,880
to watch out for problems, but I don't

1261
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,480
actually overreact.

1262
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,680
>> Exactly. You got it exactly right.

1263
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,200
>> So how did you kind of take all these

1264
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,800
ingredients and put them package them

1265
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,800
into one product?

1266
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,640
>> Well, the prlucamune is really a

1267
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,079
compilation of all those particular

1268
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,400
ingredients from traditional Chinese

1269
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,440
medicine. So we've got the the rayi, the

1270
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,040
shiakei, the beta glucan, and then we've

1271
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,200
also got zinc in there. So it's all

1272
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,960
formulated together at the appropriate

1273
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,599
effective amounts. It's been clinically

1274
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,359
studied. We've shown that it not only uh

1275
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,760
improves the immune system function but

1276
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,040
also uh improves a measure called

1277
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,359
protectiveqi which is uh it's a TCM

1278
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,640
measure of protective immunity. Well,

1279
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,920

[Applause]

1291
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,319
Doctors are notoriously known for having

1292
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,599
bad handwriting. So, I wanted to look a

1293
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,680
little deeper into this theory and to

1294
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,520
see if there's really a science behind

1295
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,680
how we write and what it could possibly

1296
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,680
mean about our personality. So, I asked

1297
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,599
handwriting expert Michael Hernandez to

1298
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,680
analyze my handwriting to see what it

1299
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,800
says about me and what it says about

1300
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,000
doctors. How are you?

1301
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,800
>> It's pleasure to meet you. Doing well,

1302
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,720
thank you. But

1303
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,119
>> just before I get started, why do

1304
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,280
doctors seem to have bad handwriting?

1305
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,400
>> Well, quite frankly, uh doctors have a

1306
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,560
lot of things on their minds. They

1307
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,560
process information very quickly and as

1308
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,160
a motor skill, their hands just can't

1309
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,319
keep up with how quick their brains are

1310
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,000
functioning. So, it's a great thing.

1311
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,440
>> Maybe it's a good excuse.

1312
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,640
>> Used to bother me before I became a

1313
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,760
doctor. Now, I can't read my own

1314
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
handwriting. All right. So, what should

1315
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,400
I write here?

1316
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,400
>> You can write uh whatever you had for

1317
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,680
breakfast this morning. Yeah. Uh, so

1318
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,680
I'll say for breakfast

1319
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,880
I had

1320
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,640
yogurt and

1321
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,119
berries.

1322
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,760
>> Okay.

1323
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,760
>> Excellent.

1324
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,119
>> Now, first and foremost, from looking at

1325
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,640
your handwriting, I'm going to say that

1326
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,800
you're a very good listener. You're

1327
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,560
actually you not only like to talk, but

1328
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,040
you're a very good listener. And more

1329
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,880
importantly, you are very good at

1330
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,599
keeping secrets. But more importantly,

1331
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,200
what we do find with with you also is

1332
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,440
that you process information very

1333
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,280
quickly, which is a great trait. Uh what

1334
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,720
I would probably say, you know, is

1335
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,160
you're not someone who beats around the

1336
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,800
bush. You're very direct. You're to the

1337
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,880
point, and more importantly, uh I would

1338
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,359
say that you're very open-minded as

1339
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,400
well, and you're very ambidextrous.

1340
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,920
You're dexterity.

1341
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,800
>> I'm going to take you home with me.

1342
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,319
>> All right, good enough.

1343
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,680
>> And you know about ambidextrous,

1344
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,720
surgeons have to be ambidextrous because

1345
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,599
you have to be able to operate from both

1346
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,680
sides of the body,

1347
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,160
>> right? This is remarkable just from

1348
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,520
handwriting.

1349
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,200
>> Well, I'm not telling you anything that

1350
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,079
anyone who doesn't know you well

1351
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,040
wouldn't tell you.

1352
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,680
>> All right, we're going to put more on

1353
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,800
dr.com. Together, change is happening.

1354
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,800
Our journey is just beginning.
