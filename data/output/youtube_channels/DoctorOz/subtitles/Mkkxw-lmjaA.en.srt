00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,080
Today on Oz, think fast. Someone

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,040
collapses. Oh my god. You have seconds

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,519
to act. It's cardiac arrest. I wouldn't

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,000
have a clue what to do. What you do next

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,720
could save a life. Plus, caught on

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,880
camera. Our core worker is a 24/7

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,400
snacker. We catch viewers unhealthy

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,039
habits in the act.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,560
See the plan to break bad eating habits.

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,560
Coming up next on Dr. Oz.

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,960
I'd like you to meet Karen. Her

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,120
11-year-old daughter Janet suffered a

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,000
cardiac arrest one afternoon in August

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,920
while at cheerleading

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,640
practice. Janet was a typical seemingly

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,360
healthy 11-year-old out for an afternoon

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,399
of cheerleading practice. But when Janet

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,440
went out for a slow jog with the other

19
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,440
cheerleaders, she never came back.

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,719
Janet collapsed on the field with a

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,199
sudden cardiac arrest. One of her

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:06,200
coaches, a pediatric trauma nurse,

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:09,439
immediately began CPR, but there was no

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,720
AED. Even after undergoing 45 minutes of

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,240
CPR, Janet died at the hospital less

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,520
than an hour after

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,040
collapsing. Janet's survival depended

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,439
upon a device that you've probably all

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,520
seen, but very few of you know how to

30
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,080
use. So Karen, if you can take us back

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,000
to that afternoon, what happened? Uh, I

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,799
had gone to cheerleading practice with

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,119
my daughter Janet, and uh, a couple

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,439
minutes later, two girls who were

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,000
cheerleaders with her ran up to me and

36
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,439
told me that Janet was laying on the

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
field and she wasn't moving. We had a

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,520
lot of calls go out to 911.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,119
EMS arrived on the scene about 22

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,920
minutes later and uh from there we

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,479
started to transport her to the

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,960
hospital. Paramedics met us uh about 20

43
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,600
minutes after that and they took over

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,680
from EMS.

45
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,759
Um we arrived at the hospital close to

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,119
45 minutes. She had been in cardiac

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:13,120
arrest already. Uh the paramedics were

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,760
able to revive her uh at the hospital.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,800
She went into cardiac arrest again and

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,400
she couldn't be saved. I'm so sorry. I

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,720
know this is difficult to talk about.

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,560
Thank you. I asked you to go through

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,319
that story as painful as is to retell

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,599
because I'm curious what we could have

55
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,120
done differently because what happened

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,520
to your daughter is not uncommon.

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,879
Everyone, this is called an AED device.

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,360
You've probably seen it. It's in

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,120
hallways and public areas all over this

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,720
country. It checks the heart's rhythm

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,040
and then it can send an electrical shock

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,360
to restart it. Did anyone have any idea

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,480
that this AED device could have helped

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,879
her? Did anyone know her heart had

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,040
stopped beating? Uh, the pediatric

66
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,200
trauma nurse knew. Um, she knew her

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,720
heart had stopped beating and she had um

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,440
already started CPR. I myself when I

69
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,519
came upon the scene, it was just I was

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,800
horrified and um I did not know um that

71
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,239
we needed an AD. And it wasn't until uh

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,080
after everything had happened that my

73
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,480
husband and I started researching like

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,560
how could this have ended differently

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,400
and uh and AED is a critical part to the

76
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,200
chain of survival when someone is in

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,840
cardiac arrest. Do you believe if this

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,760
AED device had been available for you,

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,400
your daughter would be alive now? My

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,040
husband and I um feel that had we had

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,959
one, she could very well be here with us

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,120
today. Thank you for sharing your story.

83
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,519
Thank you. Appreciate it. So 70% of

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
Americans feel helpless to act when

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
someone is having a cardiac emergency.

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,560
That's twothirds of us. That back

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,040
worries me. So I conducted a social

88
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
experiment to find out if the chance to

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,239
save a life from cardiac arrest comes

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,159
up. Will you be prepared?

91
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,319
I wouldn't have a clue what to do with

92
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,700
the AED. I'm not even sure what AED

93
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,080
stands for.

94
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,080
[Music]

95
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,480
We wanted to try our experiment on the

96
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,480
Dr. for Oz audience because no one is

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,959
better informed about health. But could

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,400
they pass this life and death test? Mom,

99
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,720
I don't take any available in the first

100
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,040
few rows. Okay. What our audience

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,680
doesn't know. Earlier that day, we

102
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,079
installed an AED on a fake wall in our

103
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,320
audience holding area. Then we rigged

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
hidden

105
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,080
cameras. To make this as real as

106
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,680
possible, we hired an experienced actor

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,440
to reenact sudden cardiac arrest.

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,560
Then we brought in an expert from the

109
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,199
American Red Cross, Lika Shaw, to play

110
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,680
the role of a helpful bystander. Our

111
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,680
audience has no idea what's about to

112
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,680
happen.

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:52,400
Oh my god. Oh, are you Andrew? Hello.

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Uh, I don't think he's breathing. Fool's

115
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,720
people were terrified and sat

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,360
motionless. Can you get me an AED,

117
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,680
please? Just get me an an AED. An AED.

118
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,560
Give me an AD. How long was an AED? What

119
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,360
is AED?

120
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,000
Um, what is I took a class once. Are you

121
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,400
Oh, can you But fortunately, Shannon

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,800
knew what to do.

123
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,120
Seven. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Put up

124
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,400
here. As it turns out, Shannon was

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,479
trained to work in AED for her job.

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,919
I am a nurse anesthetist uh in

127
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,600
Baltimore, so I'm very familiar with

128
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,000
AEDs. Shannon knew what to do, but 99%

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,320
of the audience didn't. This is actually

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,960
okay. This is an actor. This is someone

131
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,960
from the American and you did a great

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,960
job.

133
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,039
I was just like, what am I supposed to

134
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,360
do? I panicked. I didn't know what to

135
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,560
do. She kept asking for an AED. I had no

136
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,039
idea what it was. Never heard of it.

137
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,039
Then we ran the experiment again with a

138
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,360
new audience.

139
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,880
Oh my god. Oh my god. Someone get an

140
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,199
AED, please. Please not. I don't. Again,

141
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,680
most were frozen in their tracks, but

142
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,360
not this woman. Turns out she's a nurse

143
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,280
and even trains people on CPR and AEDs.

144
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,960
Everyone needs to be trained because you

145
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,880
never know what's going to happen. Can

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,880
you grab the AED? In her next run

147
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,759
through, Camille didn't know how to work

148
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
an AED, but that didn't stop her. She

149
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,840
still helped by fetching the

150
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,600
defibrillator and bravely assisting. I

151
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,000
didn't know what to do, so I just

152
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,240
grabbed it and listened to what she was

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,240
saying. Kim told us her heart was

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,960
pounding, but you'd never know it. She

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,000
remained calm throughout. Oh, definitely

156
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,820
going to look into how to use an AED now

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,440
after this. Definitely.

158
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,960
[Applause]

159
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,639
Well, we say I have the smartest

160
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,639
audience in television. Camille is

161
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,080
joining us. When the actor fell on the

162
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,600
floor and you thought he was dying from

163
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,479
a heart problem, what was your first

164
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,560
reaction? Oh my gosh, I was so scared

165
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,400
and so nervous. I didn't know what to

166
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,000
do. But I heard someone yell, "Get an

167
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,360
AED. I just turned around, saw one on

168
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
the wall, grabbed it, and went over

169
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,400
there. I didn't even think." Do you have

170
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,560
any idea what this device does? No, I

171
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,160
know it's good, and you need to, you

172
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,560
know, need to have and know what to do

173
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,680
with it. You heard Karen's story about

174
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,319
losing her daughter. Yes. 80% more than

175
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,599
80% frankly of the time we drop dead in

176
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,000
front of the people who love us the

177
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,000
most, right? We die at home, folks. We

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,720
die with our pe friends in the cars. So

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,960
we can save each other's lives. 5% of

180
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
the time we actually do save their life.

181
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,319
There are hundreds of thousands of

182
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,240
lives. We can save this year if we pay

183
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,840
attention just for the next few minutes.

184
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,080
Yes. Can all do that together? Yes. All

185
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,360
right. Leica Sha is joining us from the

186
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,280
American Red Cross. Beacon, what is it

187
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,880
that is hurting us? Why isn't America

188
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,400
responding when we see folks dropping

189
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,000
down? It been loved ones. And clearly

190
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,560
they haven't taken my class. No, they

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
haven't. Um, I think that AEDs are a

192
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,360
medical device. It's got this big old

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
lightning bolt symbol on it. Maybe it's

194
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,000
a little intimidating. It may be a

195
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,840
little scary if you've never taken a

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,199
class. You don't really know what to do

197
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
beyond what you've seen on TV. Let's

198
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,520
demystify it. What do these devices do?

199
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,440
The purpose of an AED is to analyze a

200
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
victim's heart rhythm, and if it finds

201
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,039
something wrong with it, it prompts you

202
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,120
to deliver an electrical shock to the

203
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,800
heart. That shock interrupts the heart

204
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,560
rhythm and allows it to reset itself

205
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
back to normal, which is a pretty great

206
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,000
thing if someone's in cardiac arrest.

207
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,759
Now, remember, minutes are critically

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
important here. You dramatically change

209
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
the outcome just by acting a minute or

210
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,000
two earlier. So, there are three things

211
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,680
you got to do, Brett, when you see

212
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
someone go down right away. First and

213
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
foremost, call 911. If you can have

214
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,599
somebody else do it, even better.

215
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,080
Second, if your victim's unconscious and

216
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,440
not breathing, start CPR. It's the best

217
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,360
thing that we can do. You can take a

218
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,360
class to learn how to do it. And third,

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,200
as soon as it becomes available to you,

220
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
you use that AED because when in

221
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
combination with CPR, it does so much to

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,160
help victims in cardiac arrest. Wow.

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,000
Camille, you want to learn how to use an

224
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,040
AED? Yes, I do. Maybe you can take it

225
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,720
away. Come on over. I've got a little

226
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,000
friend down here. You're going to sit

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,839
right over there and I'll sit down right

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
next to you. Okay. Okay. The brilliant

229
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,360
thing about AEDs is they're super easy

230
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,880
to use because once you turn it on, it

231
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,320
tells you what to do. Okay. So, why

232
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,399
don't we turn on this AED here. Go ahead

233
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,000
and hit that on

234
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:11,440
button and let's see what it tells us.

235
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,480
Apply pads to patients bare chest. Okay.

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,080
Okay. Plug in pads connector next to

237
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,279
flashing light. Beautiful. So, we have

238
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,760
two steps. You're going to bear the

239
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,080
chest. Beautiful. And then wipe it down.

240
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,440
We want to make sure it's dry. It'll

241
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
keep repeating itself until we do

242
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,240
something.

243
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,160
You're going to apply these pads.

244
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,880
They've got pictures. So, one pad goes

245
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,640
up here, upper right side of the chest.

246
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,320
Beautiful. Yep. And that one goes down

247
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,640
there. Exactly. Well done, Camille.

248
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,000
Beautiful. If it's a child or an infant

249
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,560
that we're helping, you can actually

250
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
still use the pads. They might touch

251
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
those. So, one goes in the front and the

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
other goes in the back between the

253
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,920
shoulder blades. Super easy. Okay,

254
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,600
great. So, pads are on. Now, we're going

255
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,720
to plug in this connector. Love it.

256
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
Isn't that unbelievable how

257
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,800
straightforward that is? Analyzing heart

258
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,640
rhythm. Remember, it won't shock. Do not

259
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,560
touch the patient unless there's a

260
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,480
problem. Right. So, the problem wants

261
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,880
you off and it's going to shock the the

262
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,800
heart back. Shock advised. Okay.

263
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Charging.

264
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,959
Stay clear of patient. So, we're going

265
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,519
to stay clear. Everybody else is too.

266
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,240
Deliver shock now. Press the orange

267
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,040
button now. Shock delivered. And that's

268
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,000
it. Paused. Wow. That's how you save

269
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,240
lives.

270
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,560
So, where can folks get trained to do

271
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,839
this other than watching the show? I

272
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,760
think that it's super important to take

273
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,200

274
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,200

The embarrassing condition she's lived

295
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,480

302
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,120

Ash Show audience, led by Tanisha Thomas

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,399
from TV's Bad Girls Club, to test them

310
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,200
out. So, what do you look for when

311
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,040
you're trying to find the best

312
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,279
anti-aging product? Well, I know that um

313
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,560
SPF is important. Also, price because

314
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,480
honey, I'm not trying to break the piggy

315
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,360
bank. So, there's so many to choose

316
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,000
from. So, uh definitely SPF and

317
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
hydration. Yeah. And I might got to ask

318
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,720
cuz I know you do some crazy things out

319
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,440
there. What's the weirdest thing you've

320
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,200
done to get beautiful, to look a little

321
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,880
younger? Oh my gosh. Well, definitely

322
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,959
cross state lines for a weave, honey.

323
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,480
Yes, it's worth it. Oh, it's definitely

324
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,160
worth it. That's right. Hello, hair

325
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,120
popping. Hey, it is popping. Thank you.

326
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
All right, so we're going to get to

327
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,720
that. My team and I have been searching

328
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,519
for the best new anti-aging products and

329
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,000
we saw these. They are popping up

330
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,680
everywhere. Actress Mindy Kaling and

331
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,079
supermodel Heidi Clume have recently

332
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,959
posted these pictures on Instagram. I

333
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,800
actually tried it this morning myself.

334
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,480
You'll notice me there getting my

335
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,920
psyched up look. There I am. See how

336
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,240
comfortable I look? I look like

337
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,760
Jason. Maybe Hannibal Lecter.

338
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,600
But you guys are doing it yourselves. I

339
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,560
got to ask, do you do you feel a little

340
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,880
ridiculous doing this? Um, a little bit,

341
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,279
but it feels really nice. Describe it.

342
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,160
Um, it feels really cold and wet, but

343
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,079
really smooth. Cold in a good way. Yes.

344
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,000
What do you think? It feels soothing. Is

345
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,680
it worth it? Yes. Not sure yet, though.

346
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,480
Are you? Well, hopefully it'll be more

347
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,399
worth it. What do you think? Very

348
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,160
soothing. Very soothing. Is soothing the

349
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,160
best word that describes us, everybody?

350
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,079
Soothing. Who doesn't like it? Oh, maybe

351
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,519
one person.

352
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,800
Um, I think it's a little too close to

353
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,040
my eyes. And then move it

354
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,720
up. It's It's on your eyes. It's not too

355
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,360
close to your eyes. It's on your eyes.

356
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,800
There. Now, how's it now?

357
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,560
Gosh. Think about it. You're supposed to

358
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,560
be able to see through it. All right.

359
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,959
Kisha, have you tried this as well? I

360
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,959
have. I have tried it. Yes. And I love

361
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,240
it. You do? I mean, except, you know,

362
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,800
despite the fact I look like a Michael

363
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,360
Myers. I mean, honey, my face felt just

364
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,959
soft, hydrated. It was just it was

365
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,800
amazing. I could instantly feel a

366
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,399
difference. All right, so explain why

367
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,000
these sheet masks are one of the best

368
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,480
anti-aging products of the year. Here's

369
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,279
dermatologist Dr. Dorsay.

370
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,120
Sheet masks. These are one-time use and

371
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,959
mess-free, and they come with different

372
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,519
ingredients based on your particular

373
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,279
skin complaint. But the key point is

374
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,000
that they're made of biocelulose

375
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,959
material that recreates the natural skin

376
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,440
barrier and helps hydrate the skin and

377
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,279
lock in that moisture. You can do it at

378
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,320
home two to three times a week or

379
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,560
anytime you need a healthy glow. So, can

380
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,079
you see through it now? Yes. Better?

381
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,600
Much better. Yeah. How about you with

382
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,360
the glasses on? It's also okay. It's

383
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,720
soothing. That's a word. Now, how can

384
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,880
you get yours on with the glasses and

385
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,560
your friend back there couldn't do it? I

386
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,160
do everything with my glasses. I've been

387
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,920
wearing them since first grade. Well,

388
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,600
you look wonderful now. It's a great new

389
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,440
look. All right, so the mask is supposed

390
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,560
to stay on 15 to 20 minutes. We're going

391
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
to have everyone take them off at the

392
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,000
end of the segment for a full honest

393
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,279
reaction and hopefully you can all see

394
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,120
yourselves then at that point. All

395
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,639
right, the next new anti-aging product

396
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,480
comes from my beauty director at the

397
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,040
Good Life magazine, newest issue has

398
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,560
this Myeller water. This is a European

399
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,480
trend, very popular, just come to

400
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,399
America. It's basically makeup remover,

401
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,000
but it's soap free, alcohol free, and

402
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,519
it's a cleanser. So, you don't have to

403
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,959
scrub or rinse and it's meant to leave

404
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,079
the skin very soft and nourished and

405
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,160
hydrated. You know, I check all these

406
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,079
things out myself. I'm the beauty tester

407
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,600
and I like the way it feels on my skin.

408
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,800
But I actually wanted to hear about your

409
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
experience cuz you sent us a little

410
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,959
footage using my water. I did. So, walk

411
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,560
us through this. Well, you know, I wear

412
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,959
a ton of makeup for, you know, for

413
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,120
television and it was really, really

414
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,480
great because I love the fact that I

415
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,399
didn't have to wash it off and as you

416
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,160
see, I'm really enjoying myself there. I

417
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,800
mean, you know, the fact that just with

418
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,000
one swipe, it was so gentle on the skin.

419
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,199
Yeah. And I like the fact you don't have

420
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,800
to take it off at the end of the day,

421
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,480
right? Which is a huge event. Okay. We

422
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,920
got Lauren, Renee, and Mandy here from

423
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,600
the audience. They are bravely removing

424
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,399
their makeup with my water. So ladies,

425
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,320
what do you think? I think that is has a

426
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,760
good feel to it. It allows you

427
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,120
opportunity to take all of it off. And

428
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,399
look how much it took off in just a

429
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,920
little bit. I didn't have to use a lot

430
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,480
of product at all. So show the camera.

431
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,560
That is a lot. That's a lot. Yes. And it

432
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,320
was a clean feeling. My face feels

433
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,399
refreshed. And I feel like I'm glowing.

434
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,839
It's nice and smooth. Yeah. And it feels

435
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,199
like it's like this u nice water feel.

436
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,120
It's not a heavy chemical thick goopy

437
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,560
stuff. And it it does work. I sense that

438
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,000
too. My face usually feels a little

439
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,160
slippery afterwards. Like I have to wash

440
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,759
it again after I've taken off stuff. But

441
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,839
this doesn't have that feeling. I like

442
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,839
that it's not greasy. It's very light.

443
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,920
Very light. We have happy customers. I

444
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,680
think I think so, too. Get in there.

445
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,600
Come

446
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,880
on. Yeah. Get that soft tea going, girl.

447
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,000
I want to thank the beauty editors of

448
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,839
the good life for that tip. All right.

449
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,759
The final anti-aging product comes from

450
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,480
my daughter Daphne. She just tweeted

451
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,880
this. She said, "New skin saver find for

452
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,120
you. Anything with amla in it. It's

453
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,959
loaded with vitamin C. Amazingly gentle

454
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,800
and exfoliation that gets her the daily

455
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,160
glow that she wants." Let me explain

456
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,920
what amla is. You all know what this is.

457
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,839
It comes from Indian gooseberry. It does

458
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,839
have a lot of vitamin C and that content

459
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,120
helps form collagen which is good for

460
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,120
the skin. It helps smooth out the fine

461
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,440
wrinkles and the lines. That they

462
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,519
actually bought a product from a store.

463
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,800
It's a cleanser. They have amla but you

464
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,120
don't have to get that. You can actually

465
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,720
just buy the juice itself in a pure form

466
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,199
and you just apply it with a cotton pad

467
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,440
like this um after cleansing and or you

468
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,680
can get amla oil and this this is

469
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,559
actually frequently used Indian secret

470
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,720
for thick soft healthy hair. So Daphne

471
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,079
tried the amla oil on her face. Why

472
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,880
don't you walk us through because we

473
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,760
actually had a experiment done on

474
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,120
Tanisha's hair. The ama oil. Yes, I did.

475
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,520
I actually used it um before washing um

476
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
and then after washing. I loved it so

477
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,640
much. I used it as a treatment because I

478
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,480
have very dry scalp. You know, this

479
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,160
weather has not been kind, honey. Uh

480
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,480
okay. Looks good. Yes, it looks good,

481
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,240
right? Soft and just got rid of the

482
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,080
dryness in I'm in love with this. Would

483
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,919
you cross state lines for that? I would

484
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,840
cross a country. The definitive

485
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,679
endorsement. I will cross a country for

486
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,559

What's your favorite at home anti-aging

502
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,840
tip? I dab a little bit of olive oil on

503
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,520
the sides of my eyes and my forehead

504
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,039
before bed each night. It's completely

505
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,280
natural and is a fantastic way to

506
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,919
moisturize. Plus, it smells great. Share

509
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,039
food junkie? Vending machines by day,

510
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,640
refrigerator raids by night. We're

511
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,880
setting up a health stick to catch

512
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,880
unsuspecting snackers on tape and bust

513
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,720
them on our shelf. The plan for anyone

514
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,720
who has trouble snacking. Coming up

516
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,080
loves to snack and her co-workers say

517
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,640
she can't stay away from the office

518
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,200
vending machine. So, we set up a sting

519
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
to see if we could catch her on camera.

520
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,919
You want to see what happened?

521
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,919
Let's look. Our coworker Nicole is a 247

522
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,679
snacker. If it's not to the vending

523
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,679
machine and get a bag of chips or a

524
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,000
soda, she's snacking on some in

525
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,919
someone's office. We're going to try to

526
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,080
get some shot of her going to the

527
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,240
vending machine and eating it. We know

528
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,240
she wants to get healthy. That's why

529
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,400
we're going undercover so you can see

530
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,880
what we've been talking about. Time for

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,440
a health thing. Mission day one, baby.

I heard she's coming upstairs. I'm going

536
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,140
to go put a camera in the kitchen.

Selfie time. Ready?

546
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,400
in a second.

547
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,960
We're about to go with Buster. She has

548
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:43,520
no idea what she's in for. I'm busted.

549
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Busted. Busted. Yeah, we got you. Good.

550
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,039
Been leaving you all week ago on healthy

551
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,240
skinny. Yeah. Yeah.

552
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,080
Dr. Hi, Nicole. If you're listening to

553
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,840
this, you've been a victim of my health

554
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,120
state. My loveies. Your friends told me

555
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,039
that you can't help but snack on the

556
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,559
temperament foods around the office. So,

557
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,280
I'd love to invite you to my studio to

558
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,280
talk about the sting. I'll see you here.

559
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,280
What?

560
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,840
What's Nicole is here along with her

561
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,760
co-workers Janice, Andre, and Kenya. Oh,

562
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,400
Nicole. Poor Nicole. Uh, no. Can we

563
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,840
switch seats? No. You want a second? So,

564
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,440
were you surprised your friends turned

565
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,960
their cell phones on you? Very, very

566
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,000
surprised. Yeah, I'm I'm plotting

567
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,679
revenge right now. You are? Yes, I am.

568
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,440
How hard was it to set up the sting? It

569
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,799
was actually pretty easy cuz she wears a

570
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,039
lot of bracelets. So, when she's walking

571
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,799
down the hall, we can hear them. So, we

572
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,760
were like, "Go get the camera. She's

573
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,440
going. She's going."

574
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,880
And now, this Kenya was behind the

575
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
cameras helping plat out this whole

576
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
thing. And now, I heard the call got a

577
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,159
little revenge on you. What did you do?

578
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,520
Yeah. Um, we stepped out the office for

579
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,159
a second. We returned. Uh, Janice had to

580
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,720
search for her chair. Hm. Uh, once she

581
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,799
found it, I got to my office and candy

582
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,400
was all over my desk. I can't believe

583
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,840
she would do that. And then Janice tried

584
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,200
to call me. So I go to reach for the

585
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,919
phone and I'm like, "Where's my

586
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,440
receiver? Don't have a receiver.

587
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,799
Couldn't put it on speaker." Yeah. Where

588
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,000
was the video camera now?

589
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,360
Yeah. See what a good sport you are.

590
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,200
What gives you the urge to go up and

591
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,720
snack like you do? Well, you know, in

592
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,039
the afternoon I just need a little

593
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,000
pickme up to get me through the rest of

594
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,880
the day. So, a little Jolly Ranchu, a

595
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,240
little Pepsi, and I'm good. You're good.

596
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,080
Yeah. But does it last you through the

597
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,440
rest of the afternoon? Yep. Just Just

598
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,799
the perfect touch. Just the perfect

599
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,640
touch. We're going to see what we can do

600
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,320
about that. Before that, Nicole, you

601
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,840
weren't the only one to get set up with

602
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,799
a hell sting today. There's someone else

603
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,679
who has no idea. There's a man in this

604
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,480
audience, a man who set up a sting on

605
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,360
his wife. Now, how dangerous is that?

606
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,919
She's here and she has no idea until

607
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,240
right now. Take a look. Dr. Oz, I need

608
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,919
your help. My wife is snacking

609
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,520
constantly. She wakes up in the middle

610
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,679
of the night almost every night. Comes

611
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,520
down and raids the pantry. She eats the

612
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,679
kids snacks for school. The next morning

613
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,600
I wake up, it's like a small crime scene

614
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,080
around here. I'm going to set a video

615
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,760
up. I'm going to send it to you. I need

616
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,080
you, Dr. Oz. I think it's time for a

617
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,080
house thing.

618
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,000
I woke up before her and she's still

619
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,400
sleeping. And this is what uh what she'd

620
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,200
had last

621
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,960
night. Her

622
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,760
cookies and

623
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,760
chocolates. And there she was

624
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,840
sleeping. She's in the bathroom. She

625
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,640
doesn't know I'm here. This is

626
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,640
everything she's been eating.

627
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:43,840
[Music]

628
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,840
That's the That's new candy

629
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,559
wrappers. Aaron just made popcorn and

630
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,559
sat down on the couch

631
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:56,080
downstairs. That's

632
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,760
her. There's Aaron at 3:30 in the

633
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,919
morning eating popcorn and chocolates

634
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:07,159
and watching TV by

635
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:11,279
herself. We caught her red-handed.

636
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:14,799
Very very clever. Erin,

637
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,279
are those tears of joy? I I I'm shocked.

638
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,400
I am so shocked. I Any idea he could set

639
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,880
this up at all? No, I had no idea. We

640
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,960
We've been together for ever. So, I had

641
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,640
no idea he could set this up. I thought

642
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,200
this was my idea cuz I wanted to meet

643
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,840
you and be it was energetic couple. So,

644
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,279
I was like, "Woo, yay." But yeah. Oh,

645
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,720
now we got to meet now. It's nice to

646
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,840
meet you. Oh, nice to meet you. Thank

647
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,760
you. You think you could throw in the

648
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,440
dog house now, Erin? No. No. I I

649
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,600
actually I watch your show and I I want

650
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,679
to be healthy and my brother's getting

651
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,559
married in October and I've been trying

652
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,760
to do everything, but I at night I have

653
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,279
no willpower. I I sleepy, sleepy,

654
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,760
sleepy. So, what goes on specific? I see

655
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,440
that I just I love the shot looking over

656
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,120
the banister at three in the morning at

657
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,720
the TV set. And what is going on when

658
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,360
you start to get those those urges?

659
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,960
Well, I'll do Oh, I'm sorry. I do great

660
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,440
all day and eat healthy, try to do the

661
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,600
diet I'm supposed to do, but then I get

662
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,120
the I'm watching TV and I get the u the

663
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,640
cravings. Uh right now it's Easter, so

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,880
there's those peanut butter.

665
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,559
And then I I my willpower just just

666
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,159
leaves. So if you can help me with that,

667
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,440

I got to go to Joe. Joe, tell the mic.

670
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,400
Why would you do this to the wife uh and

671
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,840
that who loves you so much and what

672
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,840
makes you brave enough to risk

673
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,279
everything? Well, it's it's a funny

674
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,240
thing, Doc. Uh you know, we've been

675
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,400
together 19 years and married for 16 and

676
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,039
she's always been the uh the midnight

677
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,520
pantry bandit and uh you know, the kids

678
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,520
are getting a little older now and Aaron

679
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,000
likes to not take the blame for some of

680
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,600
the stuff missing. So, there's been a

681
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,679
little bit of chaos in the house with me

682
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,880
and the kids over snacks in the morning

683
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,640
missing. And uh finally, you know, I

684
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,799
woke up a couple times and caught her,

685
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,320
but she denies it and you know, she gets

686
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,799
away with it with her little smile and

687
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,159
and and I buy it. But it this has been a

688
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,080
long time coming. Well, you have a

00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,080
popcorn and

713
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:10,720
chocolates watching TV by

714
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,720
herself. We caught her

715
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,799
red-handed. So, I'm here with Nicole and

716
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,159
Aaron and their friends and family

717
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,320
members who actually helped me catch

718
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,760
them in a Dr. Oz health sting. I love

719
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,840
doing these. Oh, question of the entire

720
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,440
group. How many of you only snack

721
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,400
because you're hungry? When you're

722
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,559
hungry? Hands up. Oh, please. Aaron,

723
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,159
come on. 3 in the morning. No one's

724
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,120
hungry. Nicole, you think you're only

725
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,279
doing it when you're hungry? Yeah. Yeah,

726
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,440
maybe. Maybe. We'll think about it. I

727
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,720
love you. All right, bigger question.

728
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,760
How many of you snack because you're

729
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,960
bored or anxious, stressed? Oh, I put my

730
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,240
hands up, too, right? That's a big deal

731
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,360
for all of us. Okay, so the question is,

732
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,440
how do we help you get past this

733
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,200
mindless and emotional eating? and I've

734
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,200
enlisted psychologist Dr. Romani

735
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Dvasula.

736
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,080
Here are some tips to help you avoid

737
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,240
mindless

738
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,559
eating. First, instead of reaching for a

739
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,360
snack, try reaching for a warm drink

740
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,360
like warm tea or warm water. That's

741
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,279
because warm liquids soothe us. And we

742
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,760
often snack to soothe. Second, replace

743
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,159
the snacking with other activities that

744
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,240
you enjoy. things like reading, watching

745
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,600
TV, or talking on the phone with a

746
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,679
friend. And finally, remember the word

747
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,840
halt. Stop and think whether you're

748
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,080
snacking because you're actually hungry,

749
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,559
or if you're angry, lonely, or tired.

750
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,799
Only snack if you're hungry. Don't snack

751
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,279
to manage these other emotions. It's

752
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:42,200
better to work on other skills and other

753
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,200
ways of coping with difficult emotions.

754
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,559
Great advice. And Nicole was stung by

755
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,399
her co-workers for being unable to avoid

756
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,240
the office vending machine and that

757
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,919
candy bowl, the dreaded candy bowl. But

758
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,760
sometimes it's not just mindless eating.

759
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,880
Sometimes you just want a snack. And

760
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
actually, you were pretty honest about

761
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,600
this. Sometimes you just want that

762
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,600
little pickme up. So here's the deal. If

763
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,880
your co-workers have tricked you, they

764
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,720
actually want you to control your

765
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,159
snacking a little bit. So we have a plan

766
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,559
for you. Is that true? Kenya, you want

767
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,520
to take it away? We want you to embrace

768
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,360
embrace the snack size baggie. Why is

769
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,360
that, Kenya? Because it's portion

770
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,520
control. Just enough to get you through

771
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,960
your little break.

772
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,799
Doesn't this sound like a big deal? This

773
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,480
is actually my bag. It's perfect. I fill

774
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,760
this up in the morning. I happen to like

775
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,039
cashews. They're just what I need when I

776
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,880
need that afternoon pickme up, which is

777
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,559
what I do. I have this little bag. I

778
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,080
can't put too much in here. I pretty

779
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,279
much fill it as much as I can. And then

780
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,399
in the afternoon, I take it. Now, I put

781
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,159
a bunch of things up there. You could

782
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,000
have carrots and celery and popcorn and

783
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,840
nuts and other kinds of nuts, frankly.

784
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,080
Even chips, maybe things that aren't

785
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,039
ideal. Veggie chips, of course. Which of

786
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,120
those would you pick to put in your

787
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,120
half-sized baggie if you had the choice?

788
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,159
H not too excited. I can

789
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,799
tell. Don't hold back now. I want to see

790
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,840
the enthusiasm dripping from your pores.

791
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,600
Is that popcorn? Is that popcorn? Yes.

792
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,120
Okay. Popcorn. Popcorn is the best we

793
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,159
can do, huh? You don't seem too excited

794
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,559
about this tip. Although, Ken, you

795
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,720
worked on it all week. I try. I have a

796
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,720
health corner. You know what? I get it.

797
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,399
You want a decadent snack, don't you?

798
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,080
Yeah. You want something real? Yes. That

799
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,080
you're going to crave. And so, my Forget

800
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,520
this idea. It's a bad idea. All right. I

801
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,880
like it, but some of you may go, "Joe,

802
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,919
you like my idea?" I absolutely like

803
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,000
your idea. Joe, you have poor judgment.

804
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,360
Look what you did to Aaron. So, here's

805
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,360
the thing. Chef and self-proclaimed

806
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,120
snacker Candace Kamay is joining us with

807
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,159
healthy swaps for all of your favorite

808
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,240
snacks. These things will taste good.

809
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,840
You will like them. Okay. So, what are

810
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,080
your favorite things to snack on before

811
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,159
we talk about your healthy stuff, right?

812
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,480
Believe it or not, I am a total snacker.

813
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,159
I loved eating pita chips and bagel

814
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,240
chips and then I found out I may as well

815
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,240
be eating potato chips at the same time.

816
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,120
So now I snack on things like avocados,

817
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,480
raw nuts, popcorn, and I absolutely love

818
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,080
kind of changing it up to make things

819
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,320
more enticing at home and that's kind of

820
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,600
where the chef role comes into play. But

821
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,039
I know that you guys want something a

822
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,880
bit tastier. So chemist has created

823
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,480
swaps for the most common unhealthy

824
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,000
snacks. So what are they? I'll put them

825
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,760
in a list for you. They are the candies,

826
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,120
the chips, the cookies, the sodas, the

827
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,320
ice creams, all those bad things that

828
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,000
you I know you all want. I see you

829
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,600
nodding your heads up and down. We have

830
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,360
options for you. Take it away. By the

831
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,720
way, the entire audience, we're giving

832
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,399
you samples of these snacks cuz I'm

833
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,320
going ask you to vote on the ones that

834
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,919
you would actually crave so much you

835
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,520
replace that junk food with these

836
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,279
Candice approved snacks. Take it away.

837
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,039
Right. So, cookies. We all know we like

838
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,279
sweets and candies. So, I created a

839
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,480
cinnamon coconut popcorn for you. These

840
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,720
are ingredients you already have at

841
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,559
home. It's simple to make and cinnamon

842
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,080
actually just a little sprinkle on top.

843
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,159
You can actually use some coconut oil

844
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,960
spray. It's really simple, light, and

845
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,480
filling. Yeah. And you keep going. But

846
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,039
what does that replace? That's for this

847
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,960
replaces the candy and the cookies. Yes.

848
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,320
Cuz we all know we love sweets and we

849
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,640
want something to crave, you know, with

850
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,039
our sweet tooth. So these are rosemary,

851
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,760
garlic, almonds. So if you love chips

852
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,360
and you like salt, cuz a lot of us do,

853
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,200
these are actually a great alternative.

854
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,399
You can roast them at home in your oven.

855
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,519
You're going to get nutrients and you're

856
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:52,320
going to really feel good about what

857
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,279
you're snacking on. Then we have frozen

858
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,039
berries and grapes. Okay, so a lot of us

859
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,760
like to get, you know, frozen yogurt,

860
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,440
dessert, and ice cream at night. So, I'm

861
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,960
also to blame on this. Go to the

862
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,440
freezer. You reach in there and you just

863
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,760
get the half pint. Instead, put all of

864
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,679
these frozen berries and grapes into a

865
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,760
bag and then you can reach in and grab a

866
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,120
handful at night and they're so cold and

867
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,960
delicious and they kind of melt in your

868
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,320
mouth. It feels like you're eating ice

869
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,760
cream, but you're actually getting

870
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,679
something that's good for you. All

871
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,039
right. And finally, water, which we, you

872
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,960
know, I think is an option, but people

873
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,799
find it very bland. Instead of soda pop,

874
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,080
what do you offer? Absolutely. Infused

875
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,600
waters are kind of all over the place

876
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,200
right now. are very trendy and I'm sure

877
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,279
you've seen mason jars all over the

878
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,120
place. So you just add your favorites

879
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,360
like mint and cucumbers here. You can

880
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,120
add some honeydew melon as well or in

881
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,799
this case we have rosemary infused with

882
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,880
some berries. So you're going to get a

883
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,880
rosemary berry feel. These are really

884
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,039
great with coconut, pineapple, whatever

885
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,720
you like. Infuse, take it to work and

886
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,000
you can really hydrate and stay full at

887
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,039
work too. So we're going to take this

888
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,039
steak and we're going to learn from it.

889
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,080
Now I want you to take these ideas.

890
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,840
There are four of them. They're laid in

891
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,600
front of you that are savory, wonderful,

892
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,640
sometimes sweet treats. audience. You

893
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,320
all have them in front of you. You have

894
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,600
those little voting devices. You go

895
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,039
ahead and vote. In the meantime, I want

896
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,159
to ask Aaron which of these you think

897
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,240
you might like. I like them all. You

898
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,960
like them all. Especially in the middle

899
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,080
of the night, right? But I really like

900
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,679
the frozen fruit. That was because

901
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,720
almost replaces the ice cream. The

902
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,440
coldness I like. So I I like the fruit.

903
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:24,159
And Nicole, how about you? I like the

904
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,960
popcorn. Great. All right. The nuts

905
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,360
and the frozen fruit.

906
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,039
Now, now I see a smile on your face.

907
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,000
There's a smile over there. That's

908
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,200
amazing. I I unlike what happened

909
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,399
earlier when you couldn't pick the

910
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,360
celery or the carrots, which is your

911
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,360
favorite. Okay, here's the deal. You're

912
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,399
going to vote. A is cinnamon, coconut,

913
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,880
popcorn. B is garlic, rosemary, almonds.

914
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,279
C is frozen grapes and berries. D is

915
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,880
infused water. Log them in there, guys.

916
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,240
Vote which oneever you want. Again,

917
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,320
these things are fantastically tasty for

918
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,519
you. And the winner is Oh, frozen grapes

919
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,360
and berries won by a large margin. I

920
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,600
would have gone with the rosemary nuts.

921
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,559
I thought so too, actually. You guys

922
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,159
could probably enjoy all of them,

923
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,440
couldn't you? So, thank you all for

924
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,880
being part of this. Candace, thanks for

943
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,320
I want you all to live a good life. I

944
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,839
mean, after all, I named a magazine for

945
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,599
that reason, the good life. But let's

946
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,520
face it, a good life is filled with

947
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,359
good, healthy food. And a lot of you say

948
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,839
cooking has become more of a chore than

949
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,000
a joy. Sorry is in that group. Why is it

950
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,400
you dread dinner time? I get so

951
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,160
overwhelmed by the cooking experience in

952
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,160
general, just making sure I have the

953
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,960
right ingredients, the right utensils,

954
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,119
measuring out all the spices and getting

955
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,800
the flavor right. And then after work,

956
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,040
coming home and cooking, and then

957
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,720
cleaning after that, it just I get

958
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,640
anxiety just from the thought of cooking

959
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,720
alone. It's just another it feels like a

960
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,160
chore. Like a chore like homework. Yes.

961
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,440
We're lucky day because I invited

962
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,760
someone to join us. He's brought some

963
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,520
simple ways to get the joy back in your

964
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,280
cooking. He's the author of Good Food,

965
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,280
Good Life, celebrity chef Curtis Stone,

966
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:49,639
[Applause]

967
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,639
[Music]

968
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,200
welcome. This show segment is all yours.

969
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,960
Take it away. I want you to go when

970
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,040
we're done. I want you to help us all

971
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,359
appreciate how we make it a joy, not a

972
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,200
chore to make our meals. Now, Sar, I

973
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,560
think good food and good life are so

974
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,160
interconnected. And I'm going to give

975
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,320
you a few little tips that make it super

976
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,560
easy. Okay. The first one, I'm going to

977
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,720
show you how to do a Baja chicken salad.

978
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,760
Right now, over here, you think to

979
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,119
yourself, well, that's not enough to

980
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,640
make a salad. And that's cuz I did a

981
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,400
little bit of preparation ahead of time.

982
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,480
So, that's the first secret. Just get a

983
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,680
little bit organized. So, Doc, if you

984
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,520
don't mind having a quick look in the

985
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,280
fridge, I've got some carrots and some

986
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,200
radishes and some cabbage that I've

987
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,839
already sliced up. So, all of that stuff

988
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,680
comes together to um to quickly uh

989
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,599
That's it. Beautiful. Beautiful.

990
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,040
Beautiful. And we just toss that

991
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,800
straight on in here. Should I open that

992
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
up a bit on my Sure. I've made a quick

993
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,839
dressing which is really simple. It's

994
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,320
made from cilantro, a little bit of oil,

995
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,839
a little bit of vinegar. Toss it in. So,

996
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,520
you know, I I cut some of this stuff on

997
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,680
a Japanese mandolin. So, you can just

998
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,440
literally stand there and slice away,

999
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,760
right? So, it's really quick and simple.

1000
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,599
Grab a couple forks. Don't be shy. Go

1001
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,880
on. Use your hands. Use your hands.

1002
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,000
Um, that's a good thing about having a

1003
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,640
doctor in the kitchen. We know that

1004
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,880
you've got nice clean hands.

1005
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,119
Um, and then the avocados, which I've

1006
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,040
kept to put on last because they're a

1007
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,920
little bit softer, of course. Some of

1008
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,599
those uh pumpkin seeds, you can go ahead

1009
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,599
and throw a little bit of that feta in

1010
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,720
and then drizzle drizzle your uh

1011
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,200
dressing over. So, in literally 60

1012
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,280
seconds or so, you can put together a

1013
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,720
beautiful, healthy salad. So, yes,

1014
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,480
there's a few minutes of chopping

1015
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,240
earlier in the day. A little bit more.

1016
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,160
But put a little bit more. So stingy

1017
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,720
with that dressing. Don't be making sure

1018
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,560
it's not too fat. Good girl. And then a

1019
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,560
few corn chips. And look at this. Like

1020
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,400
you know, I know that corn chips uh have

1021
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,960
a little bit more fat in them. So I've

1022
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,560
just got literally four or five corn

1023
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,079
chips and you'll get that little bit of

1024
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,560
crunch that you're looking for without

1025
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,359
all the calories and fat. So that's tip

1026
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,040
number one. Let me taste it.

1027
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,880
I want to taste the chicken. Get in

1028
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,800
there. Get in here. It's good. Yeah.

1029
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,839
While I'm eating. So good. Part of the

1030
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,040
issue sorry has and so many of you

1031
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,800
viewers write about is the amount of

1032
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,640
time it takes and the mess that that you

1033
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,560
make me do it. So deal with the cleanup

1034
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,000
as well. Mhm. So the cleanup is a

1035
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,680
nightmare for all of us. Don't worry. I

1036
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,240
have to clean up at my house too and I I

1037
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,320
don't like it either. So the one pot

1038
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,160
cooking thing I think is a is going to

1039
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,920
be your best friend. Definitely. So you

1040
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,280
think of a casserole or a stew that all

1041
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,480
happens in one pot. But I thought I'd

1042
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,720
show you something a little different.

1043
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,040
I've got a big filt of salmon here and

1044
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,359
I've roasted it on one tray. So it's one

1045
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,640
tray cooking. Thinly sliced the beets

1046
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,800
and I've just put that around with a

1047
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,040
little oil. And then the salmon I've put

1048
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,800
an herb crust on it and again a really

1049
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,040
simple dressing or vinegarette that you

1050
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,119
can just go ahead and spoon over the top

1051
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,400
there. And you've got all the flavors in

1052
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,680
the same pan which is really really

1053
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,119
delicious. You literally have no dishes

1054
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,240
then. You throw this the aluminum foil

1055
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,560
away and you're done. That's right.

1056
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,800
That's it. It's so simple. So get a fork

1057
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,160
and dive in there. and tell me what you

1058
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,640
think. I want to taste one of these

1059
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,880
things. Mhm. Look how how long you cook

1060
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,040
it for. So, the the salmon's only in the

1061
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,720
in the oven for about 12 15 minutes,

1062
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,880
depending on how thick the fililet of

1063
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,320
salmon is. But it's a beautiful big

1064
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,000
piece. It's, you know, if you're cooking

1065
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,920
for a family of four or so, it's it's

1066
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,359
really easy. It's delicious. Would the

1067
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,280
family like, there's a bigger I love the

1068
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,400
beets. Oh, yeah. My son, I think, would

1069
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,000
love the beets and they're healthy

1070
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,280
because I'm always trying to figure out

1071
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,040
what's something for him to eat that's

1072
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,480
healthy. Surprise your family with this.

1073
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,680
If this is 12 minutes of work, this is a

1074
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,960
good investment of time. Yeah,

1075
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,800
definitely. Right. You know what? Take

1076
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,760
this home for the kids tonight. Tell me

1077
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,599
you made it for them on the way home.

1078
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,720
They'll be so impressed. We'll wrap it

1079
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,400
up for you. What do you think? I'm going

1080
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,320
to be impressed. Absolutely. You got it.

1081
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,359

1082
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,440
little less painful. You can find all

We've got the inside scoop. That's

1114
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,900
coming up on Monday on Dr.

1115
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:40,760
[Music]

1116
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,440
[Applause]

1117
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,880
Oz. Remember, I always disagreeing over

1118
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,480
the color of that dress. You know, was

1119
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,880
it white and gold or was it blue and

1120
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,720
black? You all remember that. Well, it's

1121
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,320
too bad butterflies can't talk because

1122
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,400
they would have added a few more colors

1123
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,800
to the debate. See, eyes see colors

1124
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,200
thanks called cones. And humans have

1125
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,640
three types of cones. We can see green,

1126
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,920
blue, and red. And you combine these

1127
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,720
colors. you remember from art class when

1128
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,880
you were a kid. Butterflies, well, they

1129
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,920
have five types of cones. They have the

1130
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,760
green, blue, and red, too. And then

1131
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,359
there are two more mystery colors that

1132
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,040
our brains can't even process. Plus, I'm

1133
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,800
not a butterfly, so I can't imagine it.

1134
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,160
But imagine that much more complex a

1135
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,920
world. So, they can see all kinds of

1136
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,839
beautiful things. The audience, when it

1137
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,839
comes to color and color vision in

1138
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,760
particular, can you guess what animal

1139
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,000
that takes the prize? What do you think?

1140
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,119
You'd never guess this one. It's called

1141
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,760
the mantis shrimp. It's the butterfly of

1142
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,000
the sea. He's got not three, not five,

1143
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,680
16 color cones. So, they can see all

1144
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,680
kinds of wacky things. Imagine what can

1145
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,280
be seen with that much. Well, that's

1146
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,640
maybe perhaps how beautiful he can see.

1147
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,240
It reflects how beautiful he actually

1148
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,160
is. Now, it's time for in case you

1149
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,920
missed it. First, if you ever have the

1150
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,520
chance to save a life from a cardiac

1151
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,560
arrest, I want you to be ready for it

1152
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,760
because odds are it's going to be

1153
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,599
someone that you know, someone that you

1154
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,200
love. For every minute that passes

1155
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,760
without someone starting CPR, the chance

1156
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,560
of surviving by cardiac arrest goes down

1157
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,520
10%. So, when minutes are all you have,

1158
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,800
there are three things you got to do.

1159
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,720
You're going to call 911. You all know

1160
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,800
that. Get people to come help you. Begin

1161
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,680
CPR. The chest compressions. Super easy

1162
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,040
to do. Then use an AED. Looks like this.

1163
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,640
You're going to see them all over the

1164
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,960
place now. And if you don't know how to

1165
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,040
do CPR or use an AED, all you got to do

1166
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,000
is learn, which is super simple because

1167
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,520
you're going to save the life of someone

1168
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,440
you know. Now, there are Red Cross

1169
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,960

1173
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,599
Frankly, folks, it's just a matter of

1174
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,359
putting two pads in the chest and

1175
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,040
getting away. The thing is automatic and

1176
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,480
it's safe. Finally, please be careful of

1177
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,760
dubious people online make it seem like

1178
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,280
