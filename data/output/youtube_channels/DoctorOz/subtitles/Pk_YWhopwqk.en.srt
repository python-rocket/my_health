1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,960
My next guest is a modeling superstar in

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,120
the 70s and 80s and she's been a

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,200
familiar face in movies on television

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,960
ever since. But the past couple of years

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,759
have been challenging for Christina

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,759
Ferrari. She has fought cancer and she

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,000
lost her mom after a long battle with

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,920
Alzheimer's. Now Christina is making it

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,240
her mission to help improve your brain

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,470
health with her new cookbook, Food for

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,380
Thought. So Christina, come on out.

12
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,850
[Applause]

13
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:36,280
[Music]

14
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,280
[Applause]

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,399
You know, you do the runway beautiful.

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,120
You know, it's been years and I always

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,719
worried about tripping. So, thank gosh

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,079
do it this time. Well, first of all, you

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,239
look wonderful. You look healthy,

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,680
actually. I am healthy. I am healthy.

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,000
How you doing after this cancer

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,840
diagnosis?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,840
Um, I'm doing super well. Well, I'm in

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
remission. So, I'm glad to hear that. I

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,840
had a stem cell replacement and I'm

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
doing really well. So, thank you, God.

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,240
In remission. Let me just get everyone

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,320
on the same page. You had a diagnosis of

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
my multiple myyoma, which is a bone

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,200
marrow ailment. There's no cure, but

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
there are very effective treatments. And

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,439
you mentioned you had one, which is a

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,560
stem cell transplant. Yes. I was

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,200
diagnosed in 2016 with multiple myyoma.

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,640
And I'm I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh, this

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,880
is this is serious." I thought it's, you

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,280
know, I can imagine the feeling at the

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,640
moment they use that word cancer. Well,

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,000
you know, Dr. Ar, which is really

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,920
strange. You think when you get a

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,920
diagnosis of of, you know, you have

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,040
cancer, you're going to panic and and

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,200
all of a sudden you think, "Oh my god,

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,720
your life is over." I don't know what

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,720
happened. I I I I did not panic. I did

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,680
not feel sorry for myself. I did not and

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,000
I wasn't scared. And my attitude was,

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,840
okay, what is it and how do we deal with

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,520
it? So this bone marrow transplant which

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,600
which please applaud you because you

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,520
were brave in the face of this but this

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,079
bone marrow transplant forces you to

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,759
essentially reboot your body. Yes it it

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,600
did. I knew instinctively the first

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,360
thing the doctors told me was to stay

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,360
off the internet of course which I

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,840
didn't do. I went right to the internet

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
and I you know I I I read about it and

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
it said you have two to five years to

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,920
live and and I said no no no this is not

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,319
working for me. So I instinctively I

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,239
said I'm going to look up stem cells bec

63
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,000
and I don't know why and I did and I

64
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
said to the doctor we're going to cut to

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
the chase. We're not going to do all

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,720
this stuff. I'm going to have a stem

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,560
cell. You know Tom Bro has um multiple

68
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,000
myoma. He's been on the show. Yes. And

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,800
uh I've known him for a lot of years. So

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,599
I called him and I said uh Tom I have

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,599
multiple myoma multiple myyoma. and his

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,959
words were, "Well, kiddo, you know, his,

73
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,400
well, kiddo, if you're going to have a

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
cancer, this is the best one to have

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
because they've made the most uh they

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,040
made the most inroads as far as finding

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,879
a cure and it's manageable. You'll be

78
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,640
able to live a very long life and I've

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,080
known people through my support group

80
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,560
that have that are 20 25 years out. So,

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,239
I'll probably die of old age, I hope, or

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,840
you know, before that, you know, before

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,840
most of my own." I don't know if people

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,760
know what this is, but which you get

85
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,000
chemotherapy, they basically kill off

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,480
your bone marrow and then you replace

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,120
the now dead or cancerous cells with

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,440
healthy ones. So the whoever gave the

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,440
bone marrow to you is basically you. It

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,519
was me. I was my own donor. Oh, good.

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,200
Yeah. They find that if you are able to

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
manufacture your own stem cells, you

93
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,720
have a better chance of a longer uh

94
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
recovery time. So I opted to use me. And

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,080
how do you build your immune system back

96
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,959
up after the transplant? How do you get

97
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,360
it back to recovery range? Uh well, it

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,200
my doctors were really uh shocked at how

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
well and how quickly I recovered from

100
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,080
it. And I I believe it's because of the

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,799
way that I've always um I've I always

102
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,319
ate. I was always uh very skeptical

103
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,560
about, you know, the pesticides,

104
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,080
chemicals, eating organic. And my

105
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,159
doctors, I was supposed to be in the

106
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,319
hospital for almost a month. I was there

107
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,200
a little less than two weeks and I was

108
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,599
home. and they said it was because my um

109
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,239
the way that I ate that it helped my

110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,840
body um to heal much faster. And while

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,400
you're struggling for your life, your

112
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,239
mom has Alzheimer's. Yes, my my mom my

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
mom has suffered from Alzheimer's for

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,360
about eight years. Uh she passed away

115
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,519
two years ago and uh it's one of my

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
missions in life. I'm working with Maria

117
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,639
Shrivever on this new book, Food for

118
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,079
Thought. You know, Maria's in the

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,759
forefront of finding a cure for

120
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,919
Alzheimer's disease. her father,

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,320
Sergeant Shrivever, passed from the

122
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,400
disease. So, we work every I'm working

123
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,479
uh with her in the Women's Alzheimer's

124
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
movement, and part of the proceeds of

125
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,080
Food for Thought are going to go to the

126
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,680
women's Alzheimer's movement. And that's

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,680
something um you know, I have two

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,479
passions now beside, of course, my

129
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,560
family. There's three um is multiple

130
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,479
myyoma and Alzheimer's disease. So, this

131
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,000
is this is what I'm doing now. This is

132
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,160
my mission in life. Well, what you're

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,919
really really good at, I think, is

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,440
giving us tools to help with both these

135
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,360
issues. So, up next, Christina has chose

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,720
us a recipe from her new book. It's so

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,320
darn fun to make. Your kids and

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,919
grandkids will want to help you out.

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,199
That's how good it is. Trust me, it's

140
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,520
fun. It is fun. This is worth it. Stick

141
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,040
around. Fun. It's fun. We are back with

142
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,800
Christina Ferrari, who has a new

143
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,160
cookbook, Food for Thought. It's all

144
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,199
about food that can improve the health

145
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,280
of our minds and our bodies. I love your

146
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
body healing salad in the book. Yes.

147
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,960
It's a cute idea. It makes sense. Moms,

148
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,880
grandmas can make this with the with the

149
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
kids, teach them about the body. Yes.

150
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,000
So, we're going to start at the top of

151
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,199
the body. This is the brain. We should

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
be eating a lot of walnuts. These are

153
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,840
anti-inflammatory. As you can see,

154
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,919
there's a left and right hemisphere, and

155
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,440
it looks just like the brain. The next

156
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,520
thing, you're going to love this one.

157
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,520
Did you ever cut open a carrot? And if

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,320
you look really carefully at it, you can

159
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,639
actually see the pupil and the iris of

160
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,560
the eye. So, what is what do carrots

161
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,320
have? They have beta carotene and

162
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
vitamin A, and they're good for the eye.

163
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,240
Did any of you know this? Anybody? Did

164
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,600
you ever look at it and see? We have We

165
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,039
have the smartest audience in

166
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,560
television. And they know about carrots,

167
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,000
but they didn't do the anatomy lesson.

168
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,280
This is one I did. I'm a heart surgeon.

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
I didn't think about the tomato for the

170
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,320
heart. You cut the tomato in half and

171
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,759
there's actually the chamber of the

172
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,520
heart. Look at that. And this has

173
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
lycopine in it and it's good for your

174
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,080
heart. It's also very anti-inflammatory

175
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,680
and it's full of vitamins that you need.

176
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,759
Also anti-inflammatory. And the reason

177
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,919
why I keep saying that is your health,

178
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,240
all health begins in the gut. So it's

179
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,759
your gut first, then your heart, and

180
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,840
then your brain. You have to feed all

181
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,360
three parts of those bodies for body

182
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,800
parts for ultimate health. You have

183
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,240
ginger for the stomach. This is for your

184
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,160
tummy. Do you ever have a tummy ache or

185
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
you're you are nauseous? This is a great

186
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,000
thing for you to eat. Ginger is good for

187
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,400
your tummy. This I love is your

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,400
pancreas. I mean, there's a pancreas. If

189
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,319
this is a sweet potato, it actually

190
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,919
looks like your pancreas. And why why do

191
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,680
you have an avocado here? Now, I love

192
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,160
this. This is my favorite. This is an

193
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,560
avocado and it's shaped like your uter

194
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,880
Well, if you're a woman or uterus, your

195
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,440
uterus. And it has a seed. Come on. It

196
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,919
has a seed in it. So this feeds all all

197
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,360
the the parts and it also has all of the

198
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,680
good fats in it that you should be

199
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,319
eating. I eat a small avocado every day.

200
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,639
U this is uh the grapes and or figs

201
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,759
which are low hanging fruits. Uh this is

202
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,479
for uh the testes or testicles. Now wait

203
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,880
now men have you know now there's

204
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,560
testicular cancer, prostate cancer.

205
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,479
These are all the things that uh grapes

206
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,599
have resveratrol in it which is um

207
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,520
anti-inflammatory as well and you should

208
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,840
be having that because it lowers your

209
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,199
LDLs and your lowers your cholesterol

210
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,120
and what does that do? It helps your

211
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,880
heart and our bones are like celery.

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,240
Celery and they have silicon in them and

213
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
you should be eating that as well

214
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,120
because it's hard to come by uh

215
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,639
naturally. You'll have to take

216
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,880
supplements but you should be eating

217
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,639
this. And so um I like this. Yeah. This

218
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,319
is you should There you go. There's your

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,720
body. Okay. And you can just throw them

220
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,560
together. Yes. Make a salad. Now, what I

221
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,160
did is I took all of those elements that

222
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,000
you had there and I have there and I

223
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,919
added arugula and some spinach.

224
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,280
Everything is organic. Look how

225
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,720
beautiful. And then the dressing itself,

226
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,720
this is spectacular as well. Pretty

227
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,120
straightforward. Yes. This is this is

228
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,800
from the book and I have other um

229
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,879
dressings in the book, but this is the

230
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
citrus Asian marinade which we're going

231
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,120
to pour over the salad. And we'll do

232
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,039
maybe about five or six tablespoons.

233
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
There you go. Here we go. You don't have

234
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,560
to deserve it. Just look at this. And

235
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,479
you tell me the family won't dive into

236
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,680
this. Yeah, I've done all this to

237
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,280
address the healthy part of the show,

238
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,440
but something that's a secret that

239
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,639
everybody is going to enjoy. It has to

240
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,759
do with dark chocolate. Dark chocolate

241
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,240
is actually good for you.

242
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,599
You chocolate turtle apple lovers. What

243
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
do you got for us? Well, a lot of people

244
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,120
think you can't eat desserts. I have a

245
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,120
whole dessert section in the book.

246
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,280
Eliminating all the sugar. I I sweeten

247
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,360
everything with maple syrup and um uh

248
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,880
stevia, which is a healthy uh sweetener.

249
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,000
And what we did here, your kids can help

250
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,080
you, too, or you could just do it

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,560
yourself. These are green apples. I made

252
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,880
them nice and chilled. And you stick a

253
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,719
little um stick in there. And then you

254
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,159
melt your chocolate, your dark

255
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,760
chocolate, which is very good. I eat a

256
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,760
piece of dark chocolate every single

257
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,000
night. Every night, look at that. Isn't

258
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,279
that beautiful? And then when we're

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,040
done, what part of the body is a

260
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,920
chocolate, you think? Oh, all parts of

261
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,040
your body loves it. Yeah, your heart

262
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,640
especially. Okay, so then you can

263
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,320
decorate it any way you want. You could

264
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,480
have your kids come in and do it. And

265
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,920
then you put them in the refrigerator.

266
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,240
And what I love about it is I made a

267
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,160
whole bunch for um New Year's Eve. Uh

268
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,440
New Year's Eve. Oh, he's going in. Oh,

269
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,760
you guys get to eat some. You keep

270
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,680
talking over. So for New Year's Eve, you

271
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
just put it in the freezer and then you

272
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,720
can have your dessert. So you don't

273
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
forget you can have dessert. And I guess

274
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
we're going to Everybody, you know what?

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,920

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,080
