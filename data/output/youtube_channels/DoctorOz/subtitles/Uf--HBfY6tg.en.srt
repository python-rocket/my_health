1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,640
It was a horror story that gripped the

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,919
nation. Jennifer and Sarah Hart had

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,280
adopted six kids. Then Jennifer drove

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,840
the family off a California cliff at 90

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,519
m an hour. When we first brought you

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,600
this story, we were still struggling to

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,080
make sense of it all. Why would a mother

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,240
do this? What was the motive? Today,

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,640
you'll hear exclusive interviews and new

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,960
insight that may help answer why this

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,640
tragedy happened. Let's take a closer

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,600
look at the Hart family.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,840
is an overturned vehicle 11:24.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,239
That's the California Highway Patrol

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,200
reporting on the crashed SUV of Jennifer

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,960
and Sarah Hart. Mothers to six adopted

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,440
children. No sign of anybody around it.

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,480
The vehicle plunged 100 ft over these

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,320
cliffs along the Pacific Coast Highway.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,160
There's a lot of unknowns on this.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,360
However, we do know several things. We

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,840
know that an entire family vanished.

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,559
Jennifer and Sarah Hart began adopting

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,439
children in 2006. The couple were

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,280
described by some friends as

26
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,280
free-spirited, openhearted moms known

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,600
for raising their own food and taking

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,240
their family to music festivals and

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,119
political gatherings seen here on old

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,119
social media posts. Yet, some also

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,119
describe a darker side. In 2011, while

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,600
they were living in Minnesota, Sarah

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,159
Hart pleaded guilty to assault and the

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,920
malicious punishment of a child after a

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,320
teacher discovered bruises on their

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,720
six-year-old daughter. Sarah admitted to

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,159
police she had let her anger get out of

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,560
control. After that, the family began

39
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,880
homeschooling. In 2014, a photo of the

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,799
couple's son, Devonte, hugging a white

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,439
police officer during a Black Lives

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,280
Matter rally went viral. The couple

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,200
claimed racist backlash from the

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,650
attention led them to withdraw from

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,079
public

46
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,600
[Music]

47
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,000
life. Then the family moved to this

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,560
house in Woodland, Washington. Their

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,960
neighbors Dana and Bruce Dalb say they

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,920
remember Devonte coming to their door

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,160
requesting food. The couple reached out

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,040
to Child Protective Services and the

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,599
Friday before the deadly crash, a CPS

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,480
worker came to the Hart family home. No

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,840
one answered. The worker departed and

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,640
the next morning so did the Hart family.

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,280
Now nearly a year later, the Hart family

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,520
tragedy is still unfolding. Police just

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,040
recently identified the remains of a

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,239
fifth child from a deadly crash. Abuse,

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,200
lies, and unanswered questions. All part

62
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,930
of a story that ended 100 ft below the

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,400
scenic Pacific Highway

64
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,400

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,920

Harmon are the co-hosts of Broken

68

Hearts, the podcast about this tragedy.

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,760
They join me now. Liz, you were

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,000
initially drawn to this story because

71
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,200
you found the women relatable. I just

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,879
wanted to understand that a little

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,080
better. I first read a headline about

74
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,560
this story when I was on a very long

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,159
road trip with my own kids. I have

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,720
three, two teenagers, one tween. And I

77
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,080
read the headline that a family of eight

78
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,440
had gone over a cliff in

79
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,959
California. I saw I was intrigued

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,040
because of course I had just spent the

81
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,000
day in the car with my own kids who were

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,480
bickering and complaining and I assumed

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,920
they had been on a road trip also. And

84
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,519
when I saw pictures of Jen and Sarah

85
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,680
Hart, I was immediately drawn to them

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,920
because they looked like people I might

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
know. And in fact, I logged into my own

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,959
Facebook account and looked up their

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,560
names to see if if I had friends in

90
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,120
common with them. I did not. Um, but I

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,120
continued to follow the story and was

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
what surprised me the most was how

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,959
quickly it disappeared from the

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,680
headlines. It was such a terrible

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,680
tragedy and it didn't seem to get the

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,519
attention that I thought it deserved.

97
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,360
Justine, walk us through the dynamic

98
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,879
between these two women. women who do

99
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,560
seem relatable when you see them on

100
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,000
social media, but they're much more

101
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,200
complex. So, they met in college um in

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,560
Aberdine in South Dakota and they were

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,320
inseparable to begin with and friends of

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,320
them friends of theirs from back then

105
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,320
sort of described the dynamic as Jen was

106
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,400
the outgoing one and Sarah was a little

107
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,759
more reserved. Um, but as time went on

108
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,520
and as they, you know, adopted more and

109
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,120
more children, it seemed that the

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,440
differences between them, the disparity

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,199
between those personalities really grew

112
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,800
at Delta and Jen was the alpha. And it

113
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,280
does appear that Sarah was a little bit

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,680
more of a traditional sidekick. And the

115
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,320
kids even said when some of the abuse

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,919
allegations came out that um Sarah used

117
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,120
to push back and toward the end she

118
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,120
stopped. And so, um, I mean, I'm not a

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
doctor, but it does seem that they are

120
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,600
playing two very different roles in how

121
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,840
this family

122
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,880
was reared. How did people react to the

123
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,120
blended family aspect of this? Um, well,

124
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,440
these women moved the children from

125
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,560
Houston, which is a very diverse area,

126
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,080
to very secluded suburban areas. And a

127
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,400
lot of the neighbors we spoke with

128
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,400
discussed that, you know, they didn't

129
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,160
want to appear politically incorrect.

130
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,560
They didn't want to appear intolerant or

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,320
racist. Um, and they had a hard time

132
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,759
understanding where the line is between

133
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
being respectful of a family that

134
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,320
doesn't look like your own and turning a

135
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,560
blind eye. And I do think the blended

136
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,560
element, you know, two gay moms, six

137
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,039
black kids, a lot of people were hands

138
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,840
off on that and didn't want to appear

139
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,520
to have an opinion that might not jive

140
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,960
with that lifestyle. And I think it was

141
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,800
really important to what happened here.

142
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Yeah. I never thought of the possibility

143
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,639
that being politically correct or

144
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
conscious of your own potential bias

145
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,520
might have actually led to the these

146
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,919
kids being ignored. Yeah. I mean, we

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,600
live in this faux post-racial society

148
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,759
where people want to believe that we

149
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,840
live in a time in a place where we're

150
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,919
equal and these conversations are no

151
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,440
longer needed. But it's it's the lack of

152
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,039
these conversations that can really

153
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,960
contribute to some really horrible

154
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,199
things. So, I think it's a hard thing to

155
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
talk about and it's a hard thing to

156
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,400
address, but we're hoping with this

157
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,240
podcast, Broken Hearts, that we're able

158
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,400
to shed a light on some of these harder

159
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
and more difficult conversations. And it

160
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,160
also simulates another idea in me which

161
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,919
is maybe these moms purposely went to

162
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,680
places right where they were clearly

163
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,520
different from everybody else so that

164
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,919
they would be left alone because if they

165
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,720
if they moved to a major urban area

166
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,560
where people might be more

167
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,759
connected to the this lifestyle they

168
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,039
probably would have had people asking

169
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,400
them questions poking at them a little

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,919
bit. You go to a rural part of the

171
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
country where no one looks like you.

172
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,919
Yeah. I mean, absolutely. And neighbors

173
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,479
Bill Grooner, who lived next door to

174
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,240
them in Westlin, Oregon, said as much.

175
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,319
And Woodland, Washington, where they

176
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,960
lived right before they went off the

177
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:09,840
cliff, is.3% black. Um 3% 3%. Um, so

178
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,360
there really wasn't anyone to confide

179
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,240
in, to relate to. It's all I mean,

180
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,880
hindsight is 2020, but it all feels very

181
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,400
intentional to keep these children from

182
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,120
being able to reach out, from being able

183
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,680
to connect, from being able to have any

184
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,680
sense of autonomy. Um, so it it is

185
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,840
pretty sinister. All right, we'll be

186
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
right back. We're back investigating the

187
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,960
mystery surrounding one of the most

188
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,520
tragic stories of the last year.

189
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,520
Jennifer Hart, whose blood alcohol level

190
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,680
was over the legal limit, drove her

191
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,280
partner Sarah and their six adopted

192
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,520
children off a cliff. Why did she kill

193
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,880
her family? The Broken Hearts podcast is

194
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,720
investigating every angle of this

195
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,280
tragedy. Host Justine Harman and Liz

196
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,560
Egan are back. So, Justine and Liz

197
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,160
talked to several people who considered

198
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,319
themselves part of the Heart's inner

199
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
circle, including a photographer who

200
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,400
immediately after the tragedy defended

201
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,160
the women that she thought she knew.

202
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,800
Take a listen.

203
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,400
They were that really bright kind of

204
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,199
presence. It was pretty hard to miss

205
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,960
them. Any event that that I was at where

206
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,520
they were, if I had a camera, I was of

207
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,319
course attracted to that. I was inspired

208
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,400
by them. They gave me hope. Everyone

209
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,639
considered them like a heart tribe. Even

210
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,800
now, Zippy has a hard time believing her

211
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,960
friends were living dual lives. There's

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,039
no part of me in all of my looking back

213
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,039
at my observations of them that's

214
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,720
capable of seeing that it was just a

215
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,800
charade.

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,039
All right. All right. So, Liz, uh, Jen

217
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,640
and Sarah have six adopted kids that we

218
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,279
know of, but it wasn't the first time

219
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,360
that they were parents. That I didn't

220
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,360
realize. They had a foster daughter. Can

221
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,320
you tell us that story? They had a

222
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,959
foster daughter when they were in their

223
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:52,320
20s. And the foster daughter reported in

224
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,880
one in, she only gave one interview. Um,

225
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,120
she prefers to remain

226
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:00,080
anonymous. She remembers that one day

227
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,320
they drove her to a therapist's office.

228
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,720
They dropped her

229
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,880
off. They never came back. And she was

230
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,120
taken from the therapist's office to

231
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,440
another foster family where her

232
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,959
belongings were already in the house. It

233
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,959
had been planned ahead. She had no

234
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:19,760
idea. So right there, you have to look

235
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:24,000
at that treatment of another human being

236
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,640
and think that is so incredibly cruel.

237
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm stunned that the system would

238
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
tolerate that degree of

239
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,560
cruelty because it's not just the

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,720
mothers dropping these this child off

241
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,399
and not looking back. It's the fact that

242
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,680
there was a system that supported that,

243
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,519
right? That therapist had to take her

244
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,080
in. Another FOS family had to accept

245
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
their the closer delivered without her.

246
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,120
It's astounding. It's brutal. It's

247
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,040
unconscionable. I'm thinking why would

248
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,720
they give those two mothers more

249
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,320
children? Exactly. Why roll the dice

250
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,680
again? Right. Doesn't that seem to be an

251
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
obvious question you'd ask unless you

252
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
didn't know what's happening? So, Jenn

253
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,279
and Sarah will go on to adopt six kids

254
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,040
in three years. Six kids. Yeah. In an

255
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,040
exclusive interview on our show, The

256
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,200
Hart's nextdoor neighbors, Dana and

257
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,680
Bruce, told us about an exchange with

258
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,160
one of the kids when he came over to ask

259
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,279
for food. He's asking for food. This is

260
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,560
just days before they were killed. These

261
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,320
are all the questions that I understand

262
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,959
you asked. Are they feeding you? What

263
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,440
did he say? That they would, he said,

264
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,920
they withhold food as punishment. And it

265
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,839
used to only be a meal at a time, but

266
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,000
now that it was going for days at a

267
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,240
time. Are they abusing you? And he said,

268
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,720
"Yes."

269
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,160
He said he was being abused. Question

270
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
I'm asking, what you're all thinking is,

271
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,120
"How's this possible? How could we have

272
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
tolerated this? The people that are

273
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,120
supposed to be in charge? How did these

274
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,320
women get away with this?" Justine, what

275
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,959
role did race play? I think race played

276
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,200
a very big role in what unfurled over

277
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,200
the course of a decade. Um Shondaanda

278
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,519
Jones, who was the attorney for the

279
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,000
second set of siblings, said that in her

280
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,320
22 years as an attorney, um she'd never

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,079
felt a tenor like the one she felt in

282
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
the courtroom where she was trying to

283
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,000
help their biological aunt maintain

284
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
custody of these children. She felt the

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,600
mind was their mind was made up that

286
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,079
these two white women in Minnesota were

287
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,279
just more suited to raising these

288
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,800
children than their own biological

289
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,320
family. And white privilege is so

290
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,600
apparent here. and the fact that they

291
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,360
were able to uh mask such horrible a

292
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,920
horrible legacy of abuse based on the

293
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
fact that they look passable or look

294
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,920
like someone you can know on Facebook.

295
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,519
This is really intrinsic to what they

296
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,040
were able to pull off whether it was

297
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,680
intentional or whether it's just

298
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,000
capitalizing on a lot of the issues that

299
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,360
plague our society. And so I do think

300
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,880
the juxtaposition between their

301
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,720
whiteness and the blackness of these

302
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,279
children cannot be ignored. And we've

303
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,959
received some criticism about the fact

304
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,200
that we are two white women telling this

305
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,200
story, but it's a story that's worth

306
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,240
being told and I understand the

307
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,920
criticism, but I also really think that

308
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,360
at the end of the day, there are six

309
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,040
kids who died and to honor them and to

310
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,880
recognize some of the issues that led to

311
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,040
that tragedy, it's vitally, you know,

312
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,320
it's vitally important. I come to this

313
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,720
story as a mother having had three kids

314
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,680
in six years and almost losing my mind

315
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,240
at the time. I know that I know the

316
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,040
desperation of having a bunch of kids

317
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,240
who are little and

318
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,320
overwhelming. The idea that they were

319
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,040
able to adopt six kids in three years,

320
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,600
which is essentially three sets of twins

321
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,360
in a row.

322
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,079
You just have to wonder how that

323
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,560
happened. Up next, the hearts choose to

324
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,160
live off the grid. They chose that yet

325
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,240
live much of their lives on social

326
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,160
media. Could their social media presence

327
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,680
have played a role in the tragedy? Stay

328
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,959
with us. We're back. Investigating the

329
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,800
mystery surrounding one of the most

330
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,360
tragic stories of the last year.

331
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,360
Jennifer Hart, whose blood alcohol level

332
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,519
was over the legal limit, drove her

333
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,040
partner Sarah and their six adopted

334
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,360
children off a cliff. Why did she kill

335
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,639
her family? The Broken Hearts podcast is

336
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,560
investigating every angle of this

337
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,040
tragedy. Host Justine Harmon and Liz

338
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,680
Egan are back. So Justine, the Hearts

339
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,720
lived off the grid, right? Yet they're

340
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,360
all over social media. It doesn't seem

341
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,600
that they match up that well. You would

342
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,200
think that, but effectively, everyone

343
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,760
who knew them in their real life says

344
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,480
that what they saw online corroborates

345
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,160
the hearts they knew. Um, and Zippy

346
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,639
Lomax, who we heard from earlier, said

347
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,240
the same. They were very good at

348
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,360
curating

349
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,480
um a version of familial bliss that

350
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,200
existed both online and in person. And I

351
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,200
do think creating that myth across all

352
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,360
platforms really prevented them from

353
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,880
ever being able to go off track and say

354
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,320
actually no, we're having a problem or

355
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,560
we're having difficulty raising these

356
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,800
children because they reaffirmed this

357
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,600
narrative so many different ways and the

358
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,600
abuse lived in such an underbelly. Um

359
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,200
you and we've gone back I mean thousands

360
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,440
of posts we've looked at and there

361
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,360
really is no wrinkle. There's no aha

362
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
moment where you're like oh that that

363
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,560
shows that something sinister was

364
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,079
happening. It was a very wellcurated um

365
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
reality in a way and it's something that

366
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,000
I think a lot of us do maybe perhaps

367
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,160
subconsciously. It makes the hypocrisy

368
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,680
that much deeper and it leaves me even

369
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,360
more questioning what happened. We've

370
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,880
been struggling for a year now. We all

371
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,800
have in this whole country understanding

372
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,920
why did these women do this? So let's

373
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
come back. I mean, let's go through the

374
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,959
main theories you looked into. First is

375
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,240
terminal illness. And I'm curious what

376
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,000
made you go there because this didn't

377
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,279
come out in an investigation. I would

378
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,040
have thought we would have known that

379
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,480
someone had, you know, brain cancer or

380
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,920
something. At one point, Jen Hart took

381
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,560
about a six-month hiatus from Facebook.

382
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,639
And when she returned, in her status

383
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,880
update explaining her absence, she

384
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,440
mentioned the word cancer. She she

385
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,760
listed a whole bunch of reasons why she

386
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,240
had taken some time off from Facebook.

387
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,360
So, of course, we became curious about

388
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,120
whether Jen or Sarah had cancer, whether

389
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,480
they had a terminal illness that uh

390
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,360
might have scared them and made them do

391
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,839
this. We did not turn up anything along

392
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,600
those lines in our investigation. It's

393
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,959
probably not that. Probably. No. Let's

394
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,720
go to number two, which is a common

395
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,880
issue we have across the country.

396
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,279
financial problems. The Harts had about

397
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:23,040
$20,000 worth of debt. They lived on one

398
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:26,639
salary of $45,000 a year. For a family

399
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,279
of eight, that's not a huge amount of

400
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,440
money. A lot of people feel financial

401
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,680
stress and don't drive their family of

402
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,680
eight off a cliff. So, I look at these

403
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,440
problems, I'm still left with this last

404
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,800
word of mental health. And I I don't

405
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,959
even know where to put my arms around

406
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,279
this, but it it seems that there's

407
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,480
something going on inside of their

408
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,800
minds. So Justin, what have you

409
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,040
uncovered? Is there a diagnosis we have?

410
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,880
We don't have a diagnosis, but someone

411
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,199
close to the family um does say that

412
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,800
there always was some indication that

413
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,120
there was something going on with Jen,

414
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,759
that there was an undiagnosed mental

415
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,320
illness. Um but we don't have I can't

416
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,440
come out and say, you know, the DSM says

417
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,360
this. We we haven't seen any um evidence

418
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,320
that she was in therapy or taking

419
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,440
medication, but something's not right.

420
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,720
Maybe she should have been in therapy

421
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,560
and taking medication perhaps. Uh right,

422
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,240
that this case is still ongoing in

423
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,759
California. I'm surprised that police

424
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,000
are still trying to figure out is this a

425
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,160
homicide or not? What's left to find

426
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,920
out? Um well, they still don't have a

427
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,600
cause of death on the death certificates

428
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,920
of these children and on Jed and Sarah

429
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Hart. Um, and in March, to mark the

430
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,759
one-year anniversary, they're going to

431
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,440
hold what's called a corner's inquest,

432
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,600
which is something that hasn't been done

433
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,600
in Mendescino County, where they died in

434
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,160
50 years, according to the sheriff. And

435
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,360
it's basically a jury of civilians

436
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,920
determining whether this was an

437
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,079
accident, a crime on behalf of one

438
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,759
person, or on behalf of two people. And

439
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,880
in so many ways, that's the end. That's

440
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,240
what is stamped on the death

441
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,079
certificate, and that is how these

442
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,759
deaths will be ruled. So, what's the

443
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,319
lesson here? What's the message from

444
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,079
this tragedy? What do we learn? To me,

445
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,919
it's

446
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,559
twofold. The first is that we need

447
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:14,000
better communication between states

448
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:17,280
about child abuse charges. When Jen and

449
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,199
Sarah moved from Minnesota to Oregon,

450
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,679
the state of Oregon should have been

451
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,240
made aware in some way, there should be

452
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,160
a national registry of child abuse so

453
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,160
that you can't just pick up stakes and

454
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,160
move someplace else when you have some

455
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,200
marks on your record. Mhm. And the

456
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,000
second thing is more personal. It's that

457
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,559
I'm personally trying to st take take a

458
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,559
step away from the screen away from

459
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,200
exclusively inter interacting with

460
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,080
certain friends through social media on

461
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,080
Facebook on Instagram and actually

462
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,160
looking out my window and seeing the

463
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,360
people who live in my neighborhood and

464
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,080
the actual friends who I have in real

465
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,760
life and to build that community rather

466
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,559
than putting so much focus as Jen Hart

467
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,880
in building

468
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,400
this fable online.

469
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,919
Thank you very very much. I appreciate

470
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,520
both yours in the hard work that you put

471
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,520
into researching this case. Since our

472
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,360
story first aired, the bodies of Jen,

473
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,200
Sarah, and five of the children have

474
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,679
been found and identified. The only one

475
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,160
still listed as missing is 15-year-old

476
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,240
Devonte Hart. He's the young boy who

477
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,120
famously hugged a police officer at a

478
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,400
rally protesting Ferguson police. To
