00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,640
She's been a celebrity OBGYn for over 20

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,639
years. Stars in Bravo's hit series

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,040
Married to Medicine. And her clientele

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,840
includes stars like Tony Braxton and the

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,640
families of TI and Usher. She recently

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,560
released the book The Queen V:

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,800
Everything you need to know about sex,

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,439
intimacy, and down their healthcare.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,400
Please welcome Dr. Jackie Walkers.

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,560
>> Thanks for being here.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,359
>> Thank you. Thank you for having me. So

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,920
T, before we get into the the Queen V

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,440
insights, uh TI's uh took his daughter,

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,120
accompanied his daughter for virginity

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,399
testing. You have a good relationship

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,079
with TI, so I don't want to put you in

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,399
awkward spot, but what do you feel about

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,760
accompanying your child for virginity

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,840
testing?

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,760
>> Let's clarify. I don't think he meant

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,239
that in a serious way. I think he

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,800
started out joking and of course it

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,280
blossomed into something else, but I

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,719
don't think we should be doing that. You

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
know, I don't think I want my dad to go

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,520
with me to the doctor to see if I'm a

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,879
virgin, especially if I'm not.

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,559
>> You're not.

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,840
>> I don't take Is there really such a

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,680
thing as virginity testing?

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,600
>> It isn't. There's no test cuz some women

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
aren't even born with a highman. You can

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,920
destroy the himman in sports.

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,000
>> Sure.

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,080
>> Yeah. And then surgeries, of course, you

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,360
know, we could disrupt the highman

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,759
there. So, no.

39
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,960
>> Okay. Just got past that. Now, one of

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,720
the reasons you wrote the book was

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
because you feel so passionately about

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,159
the need for us to understand our own

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,759
bodies. Absolutely. Absolutely. I think

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,840
we're in an era where women are

45
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,000
disempowered. And I wrote the book

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,000
because I want to empower women to one

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
speak up about feminine health and two

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,439
to protect that vital part of their body

49
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,119
and treat it like royalty.

50
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,119
>> It does.

51
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,119
>> It is royalty. It is. And we're ashamed

52
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,119
about it. We hear about it from our mom

53
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,479
at age five and maybe she had it wrong.

54
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,399
Maybe we don't remember it right or

55
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,079
maybe the science changes. But here you

56
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,479
all these years later believing

57
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,399
oftenimes myths well-intentioned as they

58
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,360
may be that can take you in the exact

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,439
wrong direction.

60
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,280
>> We can't even say the word when we're

61
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,000
born. You know, in some shows you can't

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,759
even say the word. And so kids are

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,719
raised not saying the real word. We give

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,719
it names.

65
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,319
>> Oprah told me when I was doing the Opra

66
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,599
show years ago, she would say, "Call it

67
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,319
vaji."

68
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,319
>> VJ.

69
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,239
>> VJ. Yes. I got it wrong. a ja

70
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,319
>> and one thing you you comment on that I

71
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,160
adored because it's so true is this

72
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,480
concept of a door knob question.

73
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
>> Yes.

74
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,599
>> So doctors know this but most of you

75
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,239
don't. Please explain this.

76
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,680
>> So most of the time for women and I see

77
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,000
all women they come in the room and

78
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
they'll talk around the real situation

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and a lot of times with physicians we

80
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,959
have only a limited amount of time. When

81
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,959
you stand up and your hand hits the door

82
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
>> knob it's like okay I need to say this

83
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,080
>> one last thing. Just one last thing.

84
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,720
>> One last thing. And that's what they

85
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,080
really want to talk about. And women are

86
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,680
embarrassed to talk about and they may

87
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,480
want to tell you something they did or

88
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,720
somebody and

89
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,319
and so that doororknob question comes

90
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,959
out and they really talk about what they

91
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,239
want to tell you.

92
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,440
>> And one of the biggest doorup questions

93
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,840
has to do with infertility.

94
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,680
>> Absolutely.

95
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,040
>> You have been very open which I applaud

96
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
you for about your own struggles with

97
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,920
infertility.

98
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
>> Yes.

99
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,560
>> Why is that so why is it so difficult to

100
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,680
talk about?

101
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,760
>> Women somehow take on ownership for

102
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,159
infertility. Now, I'm not sure why we do

103
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,400
that, but we there's a stigma around

104
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,159
infertility as if it's the woman's

105
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,840
fault, and we don't like to talk about

106
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,280
it because we feel like either we did

107
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,280
something wrong or we didn't do

108
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,440
something right. And I want to dispel

109
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,280
that myth that infertility is a woman's

110
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,959
fault, and it's not.

111
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,239
>> So,

112
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,319
to speak honestly, you got to get

113
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
comfortable being uncomfortable. You're

114
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,080
a big proponent of that.

115
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,440
>> Yes. Yes. I mean, go back to

116
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,440
infertility. I'm okay sharing my story.

117
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,799
That makes a lot of people uncomfortable

118
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,120
saying, "I'm infertile as an OBGYn and I

119
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,159
never had a baby and I'm comfortable

120
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,519
with it."

121
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,920
>> It's hard to get around that though.

122
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,280
>> Oh, it it takes work. It takes work, but

123
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,879
you can get around it. Just start doing

124
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
it. A journey of a million miles starts

125
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,080
with one step. Just start doing it.

126
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,519
>> All right. So, are you okay with

127
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
answering some uncomfortable questions

128
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,040
from around the country?

129
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,200
>> Let's do it.

130
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,239
>> Right. These were viewers who were so

131
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,360
embarrassed they didn't want to put

132
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,480
their names on the questions. We're

133
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,239
going to protect them, but these are

134
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,959
common questions I know many of you

135
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,840
have. We're going to start with your

136
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,400
hometown of Atlanta.

137
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,599
>> All right.

138
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
>> Where Share Carare is based.

139
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,000
>> Yes.

140
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,959
>> All right. So, I've douched for many

141
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,959
years, but recently a friend told me I

142
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,239
should stop. Is there anything wrong

143
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,560
with douching?

144
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,880
>> Listen to your friend on this. And there

145
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,880
is a lot wrong with douching. You're w

146
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,600
There's a bacteria that should be in the

147
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,560
vagina, Lactobacillus. And douching

148
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,720
washes away that lactobacillus, changes

149
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,479
the pH of the vagina, and sets you up

150
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
for a ton of infections, bacteria,

151
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,800
vaginosis, and yeast. So, no douching.

152
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,000
>> So, is down there is really a

153
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,680
self-cleing oven.

154
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
>> It's a selfcle. That's exactly what I

155
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
said in the book. It's a selfcleing

156
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320
oven.

157
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
>> Making sure you got it in there. Up

158
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
next, even more of what you wanted to

159
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,360
know, but we're too afraid to ask of

160
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,960
your gyn. We're going to take all your

161
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,280
awkward questions. Stick around.

162
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,199
>> We're back with celebrity OBGYn, Dr.

163
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,120
Jackie Walters, who's here with

164
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
everything you need to know about down

165
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,400
there, but you're too afraid to ask. So,

166
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,560
we reached out to our Dr. draws viewers

167
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
across the country and ask them to send

168
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,919
us the questions they've been too

169
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,800
embarrassed and afraid to ask their own

170
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,800
OB/GYN. Next question is from Dallas.

171
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,360
Here's a question. I have bad reactions

172
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
to taking the pill. My doctor suggests

173
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,199
trying the ring for birth control. I'm

174
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,320
nervous about the procedure. How does

175
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,400
the ring work?

176
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,000
>> So, the ring is really a birth control

177
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,280
pill in a plastic form.

178
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
>> I brought you a little demo. You like

179
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,479
demo?

180
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
>> Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it.

181
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,919
So, of course, this

182
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,520
>> just orient everybody here.

183
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,800
>> Of course, I know everybody in the room

184
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,919
knows what this is, right?

185
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,440
>> But this is for the men.

186
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,479
>> Okay. For the men. All right. So, this

187
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,560
is the female body in a sense. Vagina,

188
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,440
cervix, uterus, bladder, rectum. And so,

189
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,120
the ring works with medicine embedded

190
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,639
estrogen, progesterone, just like in a

191
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,440
birth control pill. It's embedded in

192
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,120
this plastic.

193
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,560
>> And once it's down around the cervix, it

194
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,479
secretes its hormones like that.

195
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,840
>> Absolutely. The body absorbs that just

196
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,600
like it would if you were taking a peel

197
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,199
>> and it would secrete it for three weeks

198
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,199
and then the fourth week it comes out.

199
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,039
>> Right. Exactly. You take it out and then

200
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,680
that's the week you would probably have

201
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,080
a period.

202
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,880
>> Okay.

203
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,960
>> Okay. And so the ring is inserted by

204
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,319
almost like you could do a tampon. Put

205
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,720
your foot up if you're comfortable doing

206
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,840
that.

207
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,600
>> I've never personally done this but

208
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,160
>> never. Okay.

209
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,520
>> I'm trust

210
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
>> as a doctor you've seen it. I've

211
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,800
>> seen it.

212
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,880
>> Right. And so the ring is compressed,

213
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,039
slid into the vagina, and there's no

214
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,639
absolute place to put it in the vagina

215
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,479
as long as it's in there. And it

216
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,400
typically kind of fits here in the back

217
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,840
of the vagina. It doesn't slide out like

218
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,160
this in most cases,

219
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,680
>> but it's there. It's kind of

220
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
>> Well, I mean, can I ask a guy question

221
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,639
here? I mean, doesn't it get in the way?

222
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
>> No, not at all.

223
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
>> I mean, it looks like it would get in

224
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,639
the way. I'm just looking.

225
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,840
>> No, no, it becomes very It becomes very

226
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,720
soft and gelatinous. Most men, not all,

227
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,400
but most men won't even know it's there.

228
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
So,

229
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
>> all right.

230
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,080
>> And so, it just kind of says right there

231
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
in the body, like you showed it, and it

232
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,560
keeps you from getting pregnant.

233
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
>> And in the fourth week, you just lick

234
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,120
it.

235
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
>> Take your finger.

236
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
>> Yes.

237
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,000
>> Slide it right out.

238
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,479
>> I'm impressed.

239
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,800
>> Yes.

240
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,479
>> The OBGYn use that. Is it popular?

241
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
>> Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I mean, think about

242
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,000
it. You don't have to think about it for

243
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,160
3 weeks. It's there. You're not having

244
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,680
to remember to take a peel. I love this

245
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,880
segment. This is fantastic. I never knew

246
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
about these things. There you go.

247
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,520
>> I got all kinds of advice I can give on

248
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,039
this now. All right. Final question is

249
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,880
from Philly. It's my hometown, by the

250
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,440
way. Here it is. If someone has tested

251
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,560
positive for HPV, can it be transmitted

252
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,479
orally via saliva or sharing utensils or

253
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,199
kissing a child? What do you think? So

254
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,880
HPV, human papilloma virus, we do

255
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,560
believe and the answer really is maybe,

256
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,960
but we think it is definitely

257
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,880
transmitted orally, but not from a

258
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,000
utensil or kissing your child on the

259
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,039
forehead. It has to be typically real

260
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,360
oral. So the answer is yes to the oral,

261
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,120
but no to utensils and your child.

262
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039

>> Yes.

>> You think we have a couple copies for

271
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,039
