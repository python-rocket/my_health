1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,920
Today's true crime is this the face of

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,920
the deadliest serial killer in US

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:15,040
history. His name is Sam Little and he

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,119
recently confessed to 90 90 murders. To

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,160
put that in perspective, infamous serial

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,320
killer Ted Bundy confessed to 30 murders

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,560
and Jeffrey Dmer was convicted of

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,199
killing 17.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,119
And what makes this case even more

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,320
unusual, this confessed killer is now

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,160
drawing sketches of his victims. And

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,200
investigators want your help in solving

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,280
the mystery of just who these women

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,399
are. This is the face of a man believed

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,320
to have taken nearly 100 lives over the

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,680
course of four decades. Samuel Little.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,600
Now 78, he's a lifelong criminal with a

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,960
history of arrests for everything from

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,480
theft to attempted rape and murder.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,719
Finally, in 2012, DNA technology and

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,920
good detective work linked him to the

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,400
murders of three women in

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,560
California. Little was convicted in 2014

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,200
and sentenced to three life sentences

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,400
without parole. That's when he confessed

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,759
to the 1994 murder of Denise Brothers in

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
Texas.

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,400
When a Texas Ranger paid him a jail

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,400
house visit, Little would confess to 90

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,159
murders. A former boxer, Little would

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
stun or knocked out his victims with

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,840
punches before strangling them because

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,000
he targeted troubled women. Often their

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,799
deaths were not investigated and their

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,479
bodies remained unidentified.

36
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,880
Now, law enforcement is working with

37
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,200
dozens of state and local agencies to

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,520
match Little's confessions with cold

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
cases of women who turned up dead in

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,360
states from Florida to California

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,079
between 1970 and 2005. Investigators

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,840
have unusual

43
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,799
assistance. A very unfortunate case of

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,799
art imitating life in the most deadly

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,960
way. I'm joined by psychiatrist Dr.

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
Judith Joseph and investigative

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,560
correspondent Mars Gawacmpo. I'll need

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,080
both of your help on this one. So Mara,

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,400
this man Sam Little has confessed to

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
police that he's committed 90 murders.

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
How many the police actually know that

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,640
he's already committed? Yeah, Little is

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
currently in prison in Texas serving

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,879
four life sentences without the

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,800
possibility of parole for four murders.

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,680
Now, the FBI says that they can connect

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,959
him now to 34 additional killings. Oh my

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,599
goodness. And they are still

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,480
investigating his confessions. So that

60
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,160
number is likely to go much much higher.

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,480
You know, it's really astounding that he

62
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,680
was able to kill so many women over

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,760
almost 50 years without getting caught.

64
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,920
And it's largely because he moved from

65
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,280
state to state so frequently that

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,519
officials really couldn't connect the

67
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,440
dots until 2012. And that's when they

68
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,879
had this national database provided new

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
information. There was new DNA

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,560
technology. And it was also a lot of

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
good old-fashioned detective work that

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,040
helped put him behind bars. But when you

73
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,920
look at the details of the crimes he was

74
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,000
committing, he could have been put away

75
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,800
for longer for any of those crimes. And

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,480
yet he seemed to sliver through a law

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,720
enforcement system just wasn't taking

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
his threat to society that seriously.

79
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,480
Which raises for me a big issue because

80
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
what shocks me the most about serial

81
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,159
killers, and we've been talking about

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,400
them on the show, is how many people are

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,280
actually able to evade police for so

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,959
many years and maybe forever. Think

85
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,599
about that. There's some estimates as

86
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,720
many as 40% of murders are unsolved.

87
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,040
40%. How many of those are created by

88
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,120
serial criminals that are able to take

89
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,400
lives with impunity, not get caught? And

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,519
you guys think there are more serial

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,080
killers out there that we have never

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
heard of that may actually you rival the

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
Sam little guy? I mean, there are so

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,560
many cold cases out there that when you

95
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
think about it is is incredibly likely

96
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,680
just from a statistical point of view

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,519
that there are other serial killers out

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,760
there operating and killing people right

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,439
now. It's very scary. And these guys are

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,120
smart, right? They're manipulative. Yes.

101
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,400
And they get a rush from getting away

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,480
with murder because that's why they

103
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,000
carefully plan things out and execute

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,400
them. And then they look back at their

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,159
masterpiece and they feel so proud of

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
themselves for not getting caught. But

107
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,560
maybe that's what's happening with Sam

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
Little when he draws these

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,359
illustrations. If in fact all these turn

110
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,199
out to be real victims. So the FBI just

111
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,320
recently released the victim sketches

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,600
that killer Sam Little is drawing in

113
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,040
prison. Have they received any good

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
tips, Mara? Do you have you followed up

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
on some of these pictures? Yeah, they

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,479
actually have. So, there's a man in

117
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,639
Tennessee who saw one of these sketches

118
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,320
and he said, "That looks like my

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,400
mother." His mother's a woman named

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,400
Priscilla Baxter Jones, and she

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,720
disappeared on Christmas Eve in 1996,

122
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,800
and she was later found murdered. And

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
this man who says, "That was my mother

124
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,280
says that he remembers a man like Little

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,040
hanging around with his mother in the

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,479
'9s." And when you look at the picture

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,600
side by side, when you look at the

128
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,280
sketch and her photo, there is such a

129
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,080
close resemblance there. It's hard to

130
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,680
write that off as coincidence. Dr.

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,280
Joseph, as a psychiatrist, what what is

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,199
going on in the minds of these killers?

133
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,759
Why would this man steal a woman on

134
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,680
Christmas Eve and keep it secret, then

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
talk about it all these years later by

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,240
drawing her picture? Well, what we know

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,080
about Sam Little now is that he's 78.

138
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,479
He's got diabetes, hypertension, he's

139
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,479
sitting in a wheelchair in a cell. But

140
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,199
don't let that fool you because the Sam

141
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,520
Little in his heyday was a massive man.

142
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,600
He was 6'3 and he was powerful. One of

143
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,919
the reports described his hand as a

144
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,000
baseball m as big as a baseball mitt and

145
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,919
he got a thrill from beating people

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,560
sometimes to death. Some of these women

147
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,280
died in his arms and we know that he saw

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,120
the killing as a sort of love. And so

149
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,759
he's a sadistic serial killer who

150
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
belongs in jail. So he's very careful

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
about choosing his victims. Very

152
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,680
careful. He chose people who are

153
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,000
marginalized members of society, young

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
women of color who were prostitutes,

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,080
people that no one would look for if

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,759
they went missing. And so that's how he

157
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
got away with these murders for years.

158
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,000
No one was looking for these women. Any

159
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
idea about why he would do this? If you

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,360
consider crossing them now, what would

161
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,919
he say was the reason? Well, we know

162
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,600
that from what we know about him, he was

163
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,199
abandoned by his mother. But you know

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,639
what, Dr. Oz, a lot of people don't grow

165
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,039
up with their mothers. A lot of people

166
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,759
are abandoned. But serial killers have

167
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,680
very disturbing paths. And so from his

168
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,360
report of loving these women and killing

169
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
them because he loved them so much, we

170
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,440
know that his development was not

171
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,280
normal. He had abnormal attachment and

172
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,680
he does not know how to truly love and

173
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,600
attach to another human being. So coming

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,600
up, we speak to the officer who came

175
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
face to face with serial killer Sam

176
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Little. He's going to tell us about

177
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,120
their disturbing conversation. And Sam

178
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,080
Little had a longtime girlfriend,

179
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
believe it or not. We're going to find

180
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
out about her. That is next. I am back

181
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,479
with psychiatrist Dr. Judith Joseph and

182
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,720
investigative correspondent Mars Avao

183
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,479
talking about the case of Sam Little who

184
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,280
may turn out to be the deadliest serial

185
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,319
killer in US history. The FBI recently

186
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,160
released sketches little had drawings of

187
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,240
some of his victims and they are looking

188
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,479
for help in solving these crimes. If you

189
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,919
recognize any of these pictures uh we

190
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,240
want to talk to you. Now Sergeant Mike

191
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,919
Mangaluzo of the Major Crimes Unit in

192
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,639
Marian County, Florida recently

193
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,639
interviewed Sam Little face to face. He

194
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,319
joins us now via Zoom. Thank you again

195
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,160
for spending time with us. Tell me about

196
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,919
your conversation with Sam Little and

197
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,479
what information were you hoping to get

198
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,680
from him? What I was trying to do is I

199
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,160
had to cooperate the initial

200
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,599
investigation from 1982. Things have

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,759
changed dramatically since then uh since

202
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,520
invention of DNA and testing the way it

203
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,960
is. So I had to make sure everything was

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,479
processed the way it was supposed to be

205
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,800
processed. And uh basically I needed to

206
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,039
cooperate and I needed a confession.

207
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,919
What did he tell you about Rose Hill or

208
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,160
rather Rosie Hills murder?

209
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,919
Uh he told me that he met her one night

210
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,080
outside. She was standing outside of a

211
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,840
bar. Um she had gotten into an argument

212
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,720
with her boyfriend and she decided to go

213
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,759
with him and um it was at that point

214
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,440
soon after that he killed her. And did

215
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,879
he provide details about how he killed

216
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,479
her, why he killed her, what he did with

217
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,960
the body? Yes, sir. He um said he

218
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,479
strangled her uh in his car in the back

219
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,479
seat. He um uh tells me of a story about

220
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,759
a police officer pulling up right after

221
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,759
he had um strangled her and she was

222
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:18,639
dead. And um he was able to get out of

223
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,160
the car, distract the police officer and

224
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,800
the police officer actually shined a

225
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,599
light inside the car on Rosie Hill who

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,080
was deceased at the time. And um the cop

227
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,919
told him to leave uh because u he had

228
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,560
gotten a suspicious vehicle call and it

229
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,200
was them and um he just told them to

230
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,599
leave. He didn't check anybody's ID. um

231
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,000
at that point. So they just drove off.

232
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,080
And so from there, Sam Little says that

233
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,839
he drove up a super highway, which is

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,320
going to be Interstate 75 that runs

235
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,480
through Florida to make sure the cop

236
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,480
wasn't following him still. And he was

237
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,640
able to pull off onto a country road and

238
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,519
and dispose of Rosie Hill, dump her

239
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,959
body. And did he specify where he dumped

240
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,240
the body? I'm only asking because I know

241
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,440
these were things that only the

242
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
criminal, the perpetrator would have

243
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,279
known. Yes, sir. And that was important

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,160
for me. Um he dumped her by a hog pen.

245
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,120
Um and she was located uh decomposed

246
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,519
next to a hog pen in Maring County.

247
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,360
So you have good reason. Yeah. Go ahead.

248
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,279
I'm sorry. Uh that was important for me

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,360
because not everybody knows that. And

250
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,880
the and the fact that he knew uh she was

251
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
standing outside a bar and she had just

252
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,040
got into an argument with her boyfriend.

253
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,560
That's very important to the case. So

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,640
you speak to criminals for a living.

255
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,440
What what was like talking to a serial

256
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,440
killer like Sam Little?

257
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,360
It was surreal and at the same time very

258
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,640
chilling. I realized I was talking to a

259
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,120
delusional psychopath. Um, very humble

260
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,839
man. Very nice man, but nonetheless,

261
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,920
he's a psychopath. He's a monster.

262
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,080
That's the key takeaway, everybody. Nice

263
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,440
man. Humble man who's a psychopath.

264
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,200
Mike, I appreciate you taking time out

265
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
of your busy schedule to talk with us.

266
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,760
Thanks for your insights into the minds

267
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,200
of serial killer Sam Little. Now Marla,

268
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,279
let me ask you. It's been reported that

269
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,880
Sam actually had a longtime girlfriend,

270
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,080
which speaks again to the sociopathy,

271
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,600
the fact that he could actually get away

272
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,880
with this, that they could have a

273
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
girlfriend. What do we know about her?

274
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,519
Yeah, we don't know very much about her,

275
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,000
but we do know that she was a woman

276
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,160
named Jean. She is now dead. And Little

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,040
has told officials that she supported

278
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,959
the two of them by shoplifting. So, she

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,640
was no serial killer, but another

280
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,120
criminal.

281
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,800
Dr. Joseph, how does that even work? And

282
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
would you think that little would have

283
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,399
shared with his girlfriend the fact that

284
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,959
he had this murder streak and he'd

285
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,560
killed maybe 90 women? Probably not

286
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,320
because she'd pro she would have died a

287
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,040
lot earlier. And the thing about

288
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,959
sociopaths is that they can border on

289
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,440
psycho psychopathy which is a more

290
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,399
severe version of sociopathy. And this

291
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,399
sounds like a a psychopath. Someone who

292
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,640
carefully plans murders out, carries

293
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,560
them out, and then he gets away with

294
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
them because he evades authorities for

295
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,200
many years. So, he likely lived a double

296
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,600
life and hid all of his secrets from his

297
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,440
partner. He compartmentalizes the world.

298
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,640
That's the part that I'm really walking

299
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,480
away from. You can be friends with

300
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,240
somebody who's a completely different

301
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
and very dangerous person when they're

302
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,760
in a different compartment of their

303
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
life. Do we have any idea how Genie was

304
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,480
it? His girlfriend. Do we have any idea

305
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,160
how she died? We have very little

306
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,839
information about her at this time. We

307
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,959
never know. Maybe she she was one of the

308
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,959
90. Maybe she did find out or suspected.

309
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,200
Families do find out sometimes. All

310
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,959
right. Coming up, how can you help solve

311
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,480
the mysteries of Sam Little's murder

312
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,519
victims? The answer is

313
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,600
next. We're back talking about the

314
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
disturbing case of Sam Little, who may

315
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,000
turn out to be the most prolific serial

316
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,399
killer in US history, claiming he has

317
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
killed 90 people. We are now joined by

318
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,839
lawyer and host of Law and Crime

319
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,760
Network, Jesse Weber, as well as my

320
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,200
other panelists. So, Sam Little has

321
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,959
interesting problem because he had an

322
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
extensive criminal arrest record going

323
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,519
back to

324
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,800
1956. It's a long time, right? Burglary,

325
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,959
breaking and entering, assault and

326
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,399
battery, assault with the intent to rob,

327
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,000
armed robbery, assault on a police

328
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,440
officer, rape. These are big crimes he

329
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,200
was accused of, and some of them he's

330
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,320
actually convicted of, and yet he served

331
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,800
only a total of 10 years in prison until

332
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,000
his arrest on murder charge in 2012. I

333
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,680
mean, Jesse, you're a lawyer. Please

334
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,680
explain this to me. How how do you get

335
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,200
away? How do you commit so many crimes

336
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,560
and get away with most of it, and the

337
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,639
stuff you don't get away with, you still

338
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,480
don't pay that much of a price on? Dr.

339
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,399
This is the most troubling aspect of

340
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,399
this entire case because here's a guy

341
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,560
who got arrested for serious offenses

342
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,079
over and over again and the case has

343
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,160
either fell apart or he served with

344
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,399
little time. Let's go to 1976 in

345
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,560
Missouri. He's arrested for the assault,

346
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,480
rape, and robbery of a woman who shows

347
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,560
up on her stranger's doorstep almost

348
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
fully naked. Her hands are tied behind

349
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,639
her back and she's hysterical. She

350
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,680
claims that little sodomized her,

351
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:46,160
strangled her, beat her, and bit her.

352
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,320
What does he serve? 3 months because

353
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,519
he's convicted of a lesser charge. Fast

354
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,760
forward 1982. The nude body of Patricia

355
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,920
Mount is found in Florida. Witnesses say

356
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,320
the last person she was with was Little

357
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,079
and that the hairs found on Mount look

358
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,079
very similar to those of Little. He's

359
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,240
actually tried, but he's acquitted for

360
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,040
lack of physical evidence. Go to another

361
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,600
time. He pleads guilty to two counts of

362
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,920
assault against two different women for

363
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,639
strangling them and beating them. and he

364
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,240
only serves a year and a half of a

365
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,800
four-year sentence because he's

366
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,800
parrolled. So, when we look at this, how

367
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,639
on earth does a monster like this,

368
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,720
somebody who is such a predator in the

369
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,279
community, how was he let out to kill

370
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,480
and attack over and over and over again?

371
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,560
And just to be clear, we've been pretty

372
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,639
vocal about criminal justice reform. We,

373
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,079
you know, there the vast majority of

374
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,079
folks who make mistakes should not be

375
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,680
put away forever. But there are some bad

376
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,880
apples and we are seemingly missing

377
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
these guys because they tend to be the

378
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,600
more dangerous ones because they're

379
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,760
sociopathic. They know how to manipulate

380
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,399
the system. Dr. Joseph, let's put your

381
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,560
psychiatry hat to work here. As you look

382
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,959
at these images, what do you see? What

383
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,360
do they tell us about Sam Little. The

384
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,279
most striking thing about this, Dr. Oz,

385
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,519
every single victim had the same

386
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,519
deadlike eyes. And we know that Sam

387
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,600
Little liked to play God. He liked the

388
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,920
power of life or death. And in one of

389
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
his interviews, he mentioned being this

390
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,279
angel of mercy where he would put these

391
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
poor women out of their misery by

392
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,720
killing them and watching their half-

393
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,240
deadad eyes fade away. Yeah. So, he's

394
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,399
drawing his version of them with dead

395
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,320
eyes. Correct. And he's very grandiose.

396
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,480
He believes that he is God. So, he has

397
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,880
the power of life or death. And that's

398
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,720
scary. Well, he'll ultimately be judged

399
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,040
by God as well. But in the meantime,

400
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,480
Jesse, he's confessed to 90 murder.

401
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,480
Actually, I'm sorry. He's he's been

402
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,639
convicted of four. confessed to 90

403
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
murders, right? But at this time, police

404
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,920
are just sort of putting the pieces

405
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,360
together. And Mari mentioned 34 cases.

406
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,440
They have pretty good connection. What's

407
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,279
next? How do they go about unraveling

408
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
the the mystery of all these women who

409
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,240
may have been hurt by him? Well, those

410
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,399
sketches that he's drawing are actually

411
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,680
a huge step in solving a lot of these

412
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,079
mysteries. And right now, there's a

413
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,480
collaboration between the FBI and local

414
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,000
agencies to corroborate the details

415
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,760
provided by Little. So, they're opening

416
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,920
up cold case files. They're interviewing

417
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,040
witnesses. They're following leads.

418
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,040
They're doing whatever they can to

419
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,920
corroborate. Now, here's the thing. They

420
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,600
have a time crunch. Sam Little is 78

421
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,079
years old, and by a lot of accounts,

422
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,720
he's in poor health. They need to get as

423
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,519
much information from him as possible

424
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
before he dies. So, hopefully someone's

425
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,360
actually talking to him about all these

426
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,720
individual cases. Mara, update us. What

427
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,160
What can What can viewers do if they

428
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,600
want to help out? Yeah, if someone has

429
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,839
information, they should contact the

430
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,360
FBI's violent criminal apprehension

431
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,040
program. There's an 800 number that

432
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
we're going to put up on the screen. It

433
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,639
doesn't matter how big or small the

434
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,800
information you think you may have is,

435
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,600
it could be the key to crack these

436
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,839
decades old cold cases. And as you point

437
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,240
out, he doesn't have much time left. The

438
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,639
families want justice. 40% of cases

439
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,320
unsolved.

440
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,839
40%. Remember that number. Thank you for
