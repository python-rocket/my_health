00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,320
Today, a health alert for everyone who

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,759
has taken one of these sleep aids and

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,000
medications. New startling data shows

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,599
one out of three of you tell us you're

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,440
taking sleep aids to fall asleep,

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,119
whether it's over-the-counter or even

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,600
allergy meds. And for the first time

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,680
ever, I'm revealing the results of a 4

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,519
million night sleep investigation to

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,359
find out just what these sleeping pills

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,679
are doing to your sleep and to your

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,439
brain. Are these pills hooking you up,

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,760
taking good care of you, and or are they

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,680
keeping you in a vicious cycle of poor

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,160
sleep? It's a health alert that can't be

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,800
ignored. Doctors around the country are

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,520
sounding the alarm about patients over

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,640
relying on sleeping pills. Sleep loss

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,520
and sleepwake problems are considered a

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,960
national epidemic. Self-medication with

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,559
over-the-counter sleep aids is okay in

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,760
some circumstances. It's not okay in

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,760
others. It's not a good idea to rely on

24
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,520
those for long-term help. You can also

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,680
have difficulty with dizziness and

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,159
confusion and falling over. And

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,840
long-term it can cause problems with

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,080
severe difficulty with memory. For the

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,400
nearly 70 million Americans struggling

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,360
with sleep disorders, a pill may seem

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,119
like an easy answer. For the past 3

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,000
years, I haven't been able to fall

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,159
asleep organically. So, I've had to rely

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,479
on this over-the-counter sleep aid to

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,119
help me fall asleep. I cannot fall

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,600
asleep unless I take a sleeping

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,400
substance. That's why I launched my

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,799
sleep investigation using sleep score

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,960
data from 4 million nights of sleep

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,720
across the

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,960
country. Using sleep score, we were able

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,360
to track not only the hours of sleep,

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,439
but also the quality of sleep by

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,399
collecting information on light sleep,

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,640
deep sleep, and REM sleep. What we

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,759
uncovered might make you rethink taking

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,200
that nightly sleeping

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,000
pill. Our sleep team is here today.

49
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Sleep expert Dr. Tenuja Hamilton and Dr.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,479
Jennifer Codle along with the sleep

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,319
challenge group of viewers who say they

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,759
all have taken sleeping pills within the

53
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,840
past month and they have volunteered

54
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,280
their sleep info for our four million

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,400
night sleep investigations. A lot of

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,560
people. So, we're going to dive right

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
into what we have uncovered. Four out of

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,879
10 women in our study tell us that they

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,720
are using sleeping pills. four out of

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,200
10, which means it's even a bigger

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,800
problem in women than in men. So, Dr.

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,160
Carter, why why are they relying so much

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,520
on sleeping pills? Well, you know, you

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,599
have a really good point about women

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
using sleeping pills. We know that the

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,360
majority of people who use sleeping

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
pills are women. Could be a number of

68
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,720
things, whether it's like the pressures

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,400
of life or stress or maybe even

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,920
hormonal. You know, as a family doctor,

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,599
I have a number of post-menopausal

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,120
patients who uh complain that their

73
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,040
sleep has been disturbed since um going

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,680
into menopause. But the thing about it

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,680
is the sleep uh pill medication, you

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,440
know, industry is a $ 41 billion

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,440
industry. Goodness, we're spending over

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,000
41 billion dollars a year on sleep

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,680
medications. And now with over-the-c

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,800
counter medications, they're more and

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,159
more readily available. Dr. Hamilton,

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,519
why are people making mistakes? What are

83
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
the typical ones they're making with

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,120
these pills? Well, people need to

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,519
realize that over-the-counter sleep aids

86
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,440
are not intended for nightly usage. In

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,120
fact, people are taking them more and

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,800
more, and if you take them nightly,

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,239
you're going to need them nightly. There

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
are warning labels out there that say

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,280
you shouldn't take them more than two

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,120
weeks at a time, and people are mixing

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,640
them with medications, anti-anxiety

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,360
medications. This can increase

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,360
confusion, sedation, disorientation, and

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
even worse, cause a drop in your blood

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,040
pressure. I'm going to emphasize

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,400
something. The label actually says don't

99
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,920
take it for more than two weeks. Am I Am

100
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
I right? That's right. So, even if we

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,879
just read the instructions, we see it

102
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,000
right there. We ought to be smart about

103
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,000
this. So, let me bring in some of these

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,760
women who say they are using steep meds.

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,280
If you don't mind, get me show hands and

106
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,200
thank you for volunteering to be honest

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,720
and a part of this. How many of you take

108
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,159
a steep aid once a week? Hands

109
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,000
up. We're pretty much almost everybody.

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,920
All right. Three times a week. Who's

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,680
using three times a week? Who's using

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,400
them five times a

113
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,480
week? My goodness, it's a lot of you.

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,799
Are you surprised? Exactly. According to

115
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,120
our 4 million night investigation, most

116
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
women who take a sleep aid you you they

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
use one of these over-the-c counter

118
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,439
sleep pills. So, it's not a doctor

119
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,519
prescribing it to you. Joy, I noticed

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,519
that you put your hand up when they're

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,199
the five times a week issue came up,

122
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,560
which implies that you're taking

123
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,680
probably more than you want to. Yes,

124
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
correct. So, what do you think about

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,720
this? You're not alone, by the way. No.

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,759
So, what when did you start taking them?

127
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,960
Um, I would say I travel a lot. So, I've

128
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,040
been I'd say for the past 15 years.

129
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
15 years.

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,360
Yeah. On and off for 15 years. What kind

131
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,160
of worries do you have about that? Um I

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,759
would like to find something more

133
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,479
holistic to, you know, help me sleep

134
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,560
instead of taking a pill to help me

135
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,479
sleep five to seven nights a week.

136
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,880
Right. Are you are you all desirous of

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,919
getting off sleeping pills? Yes. Okay.

138
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
So, you're on something you don't want

139
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,520
to be on and we got to find some answers

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,840
for you. So, Dr. Hamilton, what exactly

141
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,080
are people taking to fall asleep? Well,

142
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,080
dyenhydrine is in many over-the-counter

143
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,680
sleep aids, and that's an antihistamine.

144
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,759
Now, it can help you sleep when it

145
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,120
crosses the bloodb brain barrier, but in

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,960
the body, it can also help with

147
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,720
allergies. Now, people might take

148
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,320
allergy medications to help them sleep.

149
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,840
They might have other ingredients. You

150
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,759
may not know the correct dose, and that

151
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,880
can become a problem. In fact, if you

152
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,320
mix it with other medications, alcohol,

153
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,919
there are dangerous results that could

154
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,280
happen from I mean, if you're taking an

155
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,560
a pill for allergies and you try to

156
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,479
sleep with it, it's that's not not the

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,680
primary reason folks came up with the

158
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
solution. Right. Now, you say there's

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,320
some side effects we can run into. These

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,840
are sleeping pill hangover side effects.

161
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,800
Something that I hadn't thought of much.

162
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,720
So, please walk us through them because

163
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
I bet a lot of you, especially if you're

164
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,680
taking a lot of these pills, might be

165
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,600
running into these. Yeah. Well, patients

166
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
will take sleeping pills and say, "Why

167
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
aren't I feeling refreshed? Why aren't I

168
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,880
feeling great? I'm still tired the next

169
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
day." Well, in fact, the effects of the

170
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,560
medication can linger into the next day

171
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,199
and that can cause you to be overt

172
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,680
tired. It can give you blurry vision and

173
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,440
it can affect your mental alertness and

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,919
that can be a problem with work

175
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,000
performance and even worse motor vehicle

176
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,120
accidents, right? Can be very severe and

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,639
it seems so safe you're taking an

178
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
overthe-c counter product, right? And

179
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,240
that's the problem. Who would think? In

180
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,240
fact, here's a sleep confession Julie

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,960
made after taking an OTC sleep med.

182
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,120
I take the over-the-counter sleeping

183
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,280
pills because I have a hard time staying

184
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
asleep. I can fall asleep, I just don't

185
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,680
stay asleep. So, I've tried everything

186
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,840
over the counter. And every morning, I

187
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,240
wake up and I feel groggy and cloudy and

188
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,919
I can't shake it off.

189
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,440
Julie, you don't look very happy there.

190
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,280
So, what is it like when you can't get a

191
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,759
night a good night's sleep? I can't

192
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,960
function at work. I'm cranky. I'm angry.

193
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,039
I'm on edge. I I just feel like I need

194
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,960
to go back home and go to sleep. Yeah.

195
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,400
Which is how a lot of American females

196
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,800
are feeling now. That's called How does

197
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
a sleep pill hangover work? Well, and

198
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
this is a real thing, let me tell you.

199
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,240
So, you might have problems sleeping,

200
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,160
okay? And you take a sleep pill. Okay,

201
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,880
that's fine. But the problem is the next

202
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
morning you might feel almost hung over.

203
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,000
That's what a lot of my patients call

204
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,840
it. You might feel groggy. You might be

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,199
forgetful. And but you're at work, so

206
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
you got to function. And what do you do?

207
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,680
One of these pills is gone. One of these

208
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,199
pills. You've taken a pill. Thank you,

209
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
Dr. Oz. So, we're going to reach for the

210
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,240
coffee because we got to we got to stay

211
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,919
awake. You like coffee? Yes, I like

212
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,120
coffee. I suspect that you might from

213
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
that video. We're going to do a cup of

214
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,759
coffee because it's got caffeine. It

215
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,360
might help us stay alert, but the

216
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,240
problem is that may not cut it. So,

217
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,919
we're going to do another one. And I

218
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,039
don't know how how many people drink

219
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,319
more than two cups of coffee a day.

220
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,319
There are a lot of people. You might

221
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,240
even need that third cup of caffeine to

222
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,080
help you stay awake. The problem with

223
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,560
that though is that by the end of the

224
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,960
day, you then might have problems going

225
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,960
to sleep and may need another sleep

226
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,720
pill. What this does is it creates a

227
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,479
vicious cycle and it really doesn't deal

228
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
with the underlying issue. It can

229
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,759
actually be very problematic and this is

230
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,280
the cycle that we fall into. It's

231
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
actually more like a whirlpool getting

232
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,440
sucked down the drain. Another problem

233
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,800
of course Dr. Hamilton is one that you

234
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,919
talk frequently about which is not just

235
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,520
a quantity of sleep. Yeah. According to

236
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,280
research, although these sleeping pills

237
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,800
might help you sleep longer, are you

238
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,400
really sleeping better? Not really. In

239
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,680
fact, it can affect the amount of REM

240
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,680
sleep that you get. And that's your

241
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
restorative stage of sleep. Uh, and that

242
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,680
affects your daily functioning. So, moms

243
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
are right, I guess, right? Quality over

244
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,960
quantity. Absolutely. Which most of us

245
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
aren't even aware of, but ends up being

246
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,360
really important when trying to live

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,599
your life the right way. So, up next,

248
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,840
the biggest question that we get asked.

249
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,759
Can you become addicted to sleeping

250
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,280
pills? Find out what you need to know.

251
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,719
All right, it's time for the number one

252
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,120
question I get asked about sleeping

253
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,080
pills. Are you ready for it? Can you get

254
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,080
addicted? It's a wise question to ask.

255
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,440
So, we've talked about the cycle of

256
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,440
seeping pill, you know, abuse, but we

257
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,720
get the hangovers. But then there's also

258
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,440
another problem that's probably even a

259
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,040
bigger one. Tolerance, right? So, if

260
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,720
you're out there, you know, counting

261
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,080
sheep, right, let's make you a sheep.

262
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,839
You take your one pill, then you take

263
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
another pill very slowly, very gently,

264
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,880
walking your way through this, and then

265
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
hopefully, right, yet you've gotten

266
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,080
where you need to be. That's not what

267
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,519
happens. Your body knows you're taking

268
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,040
all these pills, right? So, what does it

269
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,880
do? it races through the rest of these

270
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,560
pills and soon the same pills that used

271
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,320
to help you over here don't help you

272
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,320
anymore over here. That's the biggest

273
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,920
fear that we have and that's why I think

274
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,279
although we talk about addiction with

275
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,720
opiates, this is a different kind of

276
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,000
addiction. This is being addicted in a

277
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
way where the pill no longer works for

278
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,040
you. So, let's go on over here. I got a

279
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,640
little quiz. All of our sleep challenge

280
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,560
women are here and I know you you have

281
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,399
all got questions. But before you ask

282
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,839
us, I got one question for you. You've

283
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,519
witnessed us talk about some of the

284
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,600
concerns we have about taking sleeping

285
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,680
pills chronically. You've been violating

286
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,920
what the box warns you about. Concerns

287
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,839
about that worries. What kind of

288
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,200
insights?

289
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,800
Sorry. What's it going to do to your

290
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,720
liver eventually? Well, might might

291
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,760
damage other organs that you have. Other

292
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,480
concerns. Dementia. Dementia. Definitely

293
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,120
from personal experience and knowing of

294
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,880
older individuals that did that and

295
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,040
demented. Yeah. Yes. How is it going to

296
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,600
affect our mental state, our brain?

297
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,200
Yeah. Even even before dementia. So, I

298
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,440
would hope that in general you're not so

299
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
happy about what you heard, right? It's

300
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,680
not the cure all that you were hoping it

301
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,680
was. Is that a fair reflection? So, I I

302
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,000
mean, I wanted to know like is there an

303
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,920
actual safe way to use the pills and

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,519
like when can you like use them? All

305
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,200
right. So, just let's wrap all these up

306
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,800
in the one if you can and specifically

307
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,399
address the issue of how long you can

308
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
take them and how many you can take.

309
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,200
Right. Really, sleeping pills are

310
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,560
intended for two weeks at a time when

311
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,040
you're going through a difficult period

312
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,120
or transition. So, limit it to two

313
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,040
weeks. Uh, you also want to avoid taking

314
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,079
sleeping pills more than three times a

315
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,680
week. And listen to your body. If you're

316
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,680
if you're having side effects, it might

317
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,040
mean that that's not right for you. You

318
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
might need to talk to a doctor to switch

319
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,959
to something else. And also a lot at

320
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,320
least eight hours when you're taking a

321
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,600
sleeping pill because you don't know how

322
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,880
you're going to react the next day. And

323
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,040
we don't want you to have that morning

324
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,240
hangover which can increase risk. When

325
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,000
you say three times a week, what's the

326
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,920
benefit of not taking it every day in a

327
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,519
week? By avoiding taking it every day,

328
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,040
you're decreasing that risk of

329
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,640
dependence where you need it every night

330
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,120
and tolerance where you start needing

331
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,320
higher doses. Thank you very much. I

332
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,839
appreciate it very much. I want to thank

333
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
all you women for being honest and

334
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,120
thoughtful about these issues. I know

335
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,560
they're affecting a lot of us. Thank you
