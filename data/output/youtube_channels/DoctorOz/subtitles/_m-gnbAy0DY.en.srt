Roland is here to prove just what a

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,880
survivor she is. From the joy of

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,000
becoming a mom. Moments of me actually

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,320
catching poo in my hands. So, and how

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,640
she lost the baby weight. For me, it is

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,279
not about being skinny. I just want to

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,119
feel good. Plus, Real Housewife of New

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,200
Thank you very much. Welcome to the

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,600
show. Kelly Roland is music royalty

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,320
first as part of Destiny's Child now as

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,719
a successful solo artist. But recently,

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,800
in a period of just seven months, Kelly

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,359
experienced both the joy of marriage and

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,199
motherhood and the tragic sudden death

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,600
of her beloved mother. Today, Kelly

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,510
Roland is here to prove just what a

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:18,310
survivor she is. Kelly, come on

out. Hi. Hi.

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,799
Oh, thank you for coming. Oh, thank you

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,520
for having me. I'm so excited to be

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,520
here. Hi, everybody.

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,600
So, you recently did something that's

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,840
got a lot of people talking and raised a

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,840
very, very big question. Is there a

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,759
possibility of a Destiny's Child reunion

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,600
or just just a one-off event that you

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,399
did? You know what? It was a one-off

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,320
event. Um, Michelle had this incredible

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
record called Say Yes. If you don't have

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,840
it, you should definitely do it. I have

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,439
it. It's amazing. And um she asked

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,880
myself and Beyonce to get on the record.

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,880
It was just as simple as that. And there

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,799
you go. A reunion happened. It was very

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,799
easy. Well, you look at Kelly and she

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,399
has that incredible new mother glow. A

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,200
thank you. Just posed for a wonderful

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,160
cover for the Essence magazine. Uh and

54
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
these photos I'm going to show them to

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
you. They're unbelievable. Thank you. Is

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,840
motherhood everything you dreamed it

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,920
would be? Yes. I mean it's it's such a

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,000
beautiful thing because we have the most

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,319
beautiful moments where Titan is a cute

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,440
child. He's a cute kid. Does he have an

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,120
agent yet? You know, he doesn't. But I

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,040
have amazing moments like of course when

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
he's waking up, we get to smell him. He

64
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,800
smells so good to moments of me actually

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,599
catching poo in my hand. So, it's been

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
some really ups and downs and just some

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,280
messes at times, but it's fun. So, I

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,519
understand you sing him to sleep. So, if

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
you're a Grammy award-winning artist,

70
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,280
what do you sing to your child? There's

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,959
the song that I recorded called Mama's

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,319
Little Baby. And I just simply say to

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,040
him, you will always

74
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:00,400
be mommy's Little

75
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Baby. It's really sweet. Perfect. So,

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,280
the lyrics are ideal. Yeah, it's it's

77
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,519
really sweet. What surprised you the

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,959
most about Mothers? You're 6 months into

79
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,959
the Yes. experience. Six. Let me see. I

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,680
think what surprised me is probably how

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,360
fast he's growing. I mean, literally in

82
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,879
the morning, he's like this size, and

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
when I get back, he's this size. I'm

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,440
like, what are you going to do today?

85
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,400
And I I think the hardest is really

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,000
trying to balance being a wife, being a

87
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,920
mom, and um having your your job and

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
your occupation at at the same time.

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,799
Like, you want to do everything and you

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,200
want to do everything great. Y'all

91
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,760
understand, don't you, Liz? I do. So, I

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,360
just I just I always want to do that,

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,760
right? But I always want to have my

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,720
sanity at the end of the day as well.

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
You know, there's an interesting

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,599
balancing act we not just between

97
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,799
ourselves and our children, but in our

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,040
relationships and our children. Yes.

99
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,959
Yes. And I have this conversation with

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
my wife all the time about who's more

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,640
important, the babies or the of the

102
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
spouse. Oh, y'all are I think the

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,400
relationship with with your partner is

104
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
the most important relationship. I mean,

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,439
that's how the baby got here. That's

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,599
right. So, I think I think that's the

107
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,599
most important relationship to have and

108
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,760
that's the way I've ordered mine. And so

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,040
it's my husband, my baby, my career, and

110
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,720
that's exactly how it goes in my

111
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,919
household. Yeah. And it's something we

112
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,199
don't talk about much, but I know that

113
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,040
it hurts relationships sometimes,

114
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,240
ironically, because you fall in, you

115
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,639
know, in with the baby. And of course,

116
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,440
baby's very demanding for time. What?

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,800
What? Huh? What? Yes. So, of all the

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,400
things you do, one of the most

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,639
impressive to me is that you maintain

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,080
such an incredible body. You just made,

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,160
you know, you're able to, you know, to

122
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,000
lose baby fat as you have done. You lost

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,800
70 pounds. Is that right? Almost.

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,600
Almost. I'm a work in progress. I am a

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,639
work in progress. You know what? It took

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,880
a lot of dedication. And for me, it is

127
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,280
not about being skinny. I just want to

128
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,280
feel good. If I feel like I look cute in

129
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,280
this dress or this great pair of pants,

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,360
then that's what I like. I I like to

131
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,639
feel good. I feel like it radiates all

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,080
over who we are. And um I just I just

133
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
want to feel good. What's the right

134
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,040
motivation? Because if you aim at that,

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,479
you actually have a goal that you can

136
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,919
meet, but you still have to do things to

137
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,919
get there. So, give me that. I mean, I

138
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,800
had to work out. I did a lot of cardio.

139
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,360
I did spinning. I practiced this 8020

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
rule where like 80% of the time I'm

141
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,639
eating foods that like, you know, really

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
give me nourishment and give me energy

143
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,400
for my workouts because I can't lie, I

144
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,160
will do two workouts a day. I go a

145
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,880
little ham and um and the other 20% I

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,960
love chocolate and I love wine. So

147
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:37,360
that's my 20 and I'm You clapped on

148
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,560
that. So that's how I approach it.

149
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
You're you're so serious about

150
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
motherhood. You actually became a

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,520
spokesperson for a baby fabric detergent

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,960
which I I would love if you if you can a

153
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,240
little footage on this. Describe what it

154
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,560
is to everybody. Yes. Well, I mean it's

155
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,560
it's the draft campaign and basically I

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,800
just love the fact that I wanted Titan

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,639
to feel really safe when he when he came

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
home and I remember smelling my

159
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,320
girlfriend's baby. I was like I want my

160
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,120
baby to smell good. She told me about

161
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,639
Drift and I started using Drift and I

162
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,479
love the fact that it wasn't going to

163
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,960
mess his skin up. It was hyperallergenic

164
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,800
and my pediatrician told me about it and

165
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,039
now we're in this cuz they have this

166
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,880
whole like phases and I'm on drift

167
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,120
active baby cuz Titan's learning his

168
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
first meals. It's so exciting already.

169
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,840
Yes. Of course it's 6 months. You

170
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,680
should. Yes. So he's having his first

171
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,280
meals. He's crawling around everywhere

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,759
and the drift active baby just

173
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,440
completely 99% of the time just gets all

174
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
those little stains out. So it's been

175
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,360
awesome. Let me shift gears. A lot of

176
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,199
happy things in your life. Yes. Titan

177
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,400
obviously. Yes. Uh but you lost your

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,400
mother. Yes. It was sudden. Yes. Cardiac

179
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,919
arrest, which means the heart just stops

180
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,560
beating. Yes. Uh, was it expected at

181
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,400
all? No. It's It's so weird. It was the

182
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,000
the strangest phone call because um I

183
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,800
was remember just putting Titan to sleep

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,880
and then him waking up maybe a couple

185
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,680
hours before. And then we got this phone

186
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,520
call and it never was on our radar

187
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,080
anything about her heart or cardiac

188
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,160
arrest, anything like that. And um next

189
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
thing I know we're rushing to Atlanta

190
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,120
and I literally get there and I realize

191
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,240
that I lost my mother. So immediately

192
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,919
after that I'm thinking what happened

193
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
you know what led to all these events

194
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,680
for this to happen and it was just a

195
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,400
surprise and it was a surprise to the

196
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,080
doctor surprise to us all. So how do how

197
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599
do you make sense of that when something

198
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,000
so much of who you are is taken from

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,479
you? Yeah. You know what? I The first

200
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,160
thing I did was of of course I'm still

201
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,560
grieving to be completely honest. Um and

202
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,880
I think that every time I look at Titan,

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,960
sometimes he's looking over my head and

204
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,759
I'm thinking that my mother's around us

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,479
some some way or another. But also I

206
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,880
went to go have a physical because I

207
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,639
wanted to know if that is, you know,

208
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,599
passed down through generations. I had

209
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,360
no no education about it. So, I just

210
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:56,240
wanted to be knowledgeable about it.

211
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,919
Most of us don't know your mom. Describe

212
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,840
her for those of us who would love to

213
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,360
know more. She is a light and will

214
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,080
literally come in here and cook

215
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,879
everybody a meal and make sure that

216
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,360
everybody is happy and say a prayer with

217
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,759
you. Just the sweetest the sweetest

218
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,919
sweetest person. And there are moments

219
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,680
where I just wish she was right there

220
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,639
next to me. And I know she is in spirit,

221
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,280
but it's definitely still hits home. She

222
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
got to meet Titan. Yes, she did. Did she

223
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,319
Did she give you any mothering advice?

224
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,560
Um, I remember feeding Titan and she

225
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,279
just comes over my shoulder and says,

226
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,880
you know what you're

227
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,159
doing. And I was like, I took all the

228
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,039
classes, Mom. I think I know what I'm

229
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,440
doing. She's like, a

230
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,760
class? So, she said, that's just stuff

231
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,959
you just learned. But anyways, um I

232
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,480
remember sitting there and she watched

233
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,160
everything that I was doing and how I

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,519
was just, you know, with Titan and she

235
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,200
said, "I'm just so proud of you." And it

236
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,880
just meant the world to me cuz that's

237
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,240
all you want your parents to do is just

238
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,399
love you and be proud of you. It is the

239
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,959
goal, isn't it? Yeah.

240
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,959
Paying back and making

241
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,480
crazy as it is, her legacy, besides

242
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,240
maybe saving your life because she got

243
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,680
you to check yourself out. Yes. will be

244
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,800
to change the lives of lots of other

245
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
folks who now are going to think, you

246
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,320
know what, healthy, she was 65, 66. Yes.

247
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,920
Yes. A healthy young woman. Yes.

248
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,800
Suddenly he's gone. Yes. And is there

249
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,480
anything I can do to make sure it

250
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,080
doesn't happen to me? Absolutely. I

251
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,680
think it's all it's important for all of

252
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,519
us to know exactly what's going on with

253
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,360
our hearts and get physicals and just

254
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,760
know what's going on with our body as as

255
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,360
a whole. So, I really enjoyed meeting

256
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,640
you. You, too. God bless you. Good luck

257
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,640
to you. We'll be right back.

258
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,160
[Applause]

259
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,000
Coming up next, we're celebrating

260
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,920

mission to fight back to protect her

262
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,080

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,920
bullying. Her heartfelt and moving open

amazing you have to see it to believe

269
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,160
it. I'm not. If you think you can't lose

270
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,519
weight, think again. How they did it so

271
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,000

277
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,760
[Music]

278
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,000
[Applause]

279
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,920
Today's show is all about moms and our

280
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,279
studio audience is filled with mothers

281
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,120
and daughters. Let me hear you guys.

282
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,640
There's one more beautiful than the

283
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,000
next. I I love when beautiful women

284
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,839
bring up other beautiful women. I'm very

285
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,920
proud that you are all here. So, Jacine

286
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,600
Lorita is a courageous mom and she's on

287
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,760
a mission. She's fighting back to

288
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,760
protect her innocent autistic son from

289
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,920
cyber bullying.

290
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,320
How far would you go to protect your

291
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,800
child from the pain of bullying? I love

292
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,959
you. Jacqueline Lorita had to face that

293
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,519
question head on when she came upon a

294
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,760
shockingly mean-spirited Facebook post

295
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,399
demeaning autistic children and their

296
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,800
parents. That post hit especially close

297
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,519
to home because Lorita's youngest son,

298
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,920
Nicholas, was diagnosed with autism when

299
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,800
he was 2 years old.

300
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,959
So cute. Now five, Nicholas has come a

301
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,640
long way with the love of his family and

302
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,360
the help of diet and therapy.

303
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,360
With

304
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,120
in today, Jacine speaks out about the

305
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,680
joys and challenges. Nick, it get

306
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,519
raising her beloved son, Nicholas. And

307
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
she confronts the cyber bully who

308
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,720
attacked not just her son, but all

309
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,720
families raising children with autism.

310
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,440
Bye.

311
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,519
I'm so sorry. things. You don't have to

312
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,920
be sorry. I know it's hard to have these

313
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,040
conversations. So, Nicholas is five.

314
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,600
Yes. So beautiful, so young. Boy, to

315
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,760
already be in a very shocking way

316
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,560
bullied. Yeah. I mean, anytime a parent

317
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,399
sees their child struggle or in hurting

318
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,560
over something, you're going to hurt it.

319
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,800
It's a ripple effect. And what people

320
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,360
need to understand is that children with

321
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,240
autism, they face many challenges every

322
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,600
single day. And every day they work

323
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,720
really hard to overcome those

324
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,880
challenges. So the last thing they need

325
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,440
is for someone to, you know, make

326
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,959
mean-spirited comments, you know,

327
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,800
because they don't understand

328
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,440
differences of others, you know, people

329
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,680
that are different from themselves.

330
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,680
And uh if I can, I'm going to share the

331
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,880
post. It's it's you know, you described

332
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,399
as mean and ignorant. I think it's

333
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,480
pretty accurate. So here's what was

334
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,600
said. Why do people give birth to

335
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,639
autistic kids? waste of society's

336
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,760
resources. Right. So, what went through

337
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,000
your mind when you saw that posted? Um,

338
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,800
I was angry. I mean, you're talking

339
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,240
about my child for one of many. Um, I

340
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,519
just couldn't believe someone could be

341
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,040
so cruel and mean-spirited. Um, really

342
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,240
disregarding the life or value of

343
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,639
another human being. So, to me, I just

344
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,600
was really taken aback. And then I was

345
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,760
sad because I realized these are there's

346
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
people out there that that feel this way

347
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,000
that my son's gonna have to face one day

348
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,519
and he's gonna have to to cope with

349
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,120
that. So you did something about it. A

350
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,800
lot of us sit there and stew and are

351
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
frustrated, but you actually wrote a

352
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,000
letter and this letter that Jacqueline

353
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,839
wrote getting a lot of attention. Would

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
you mind reading part of it? A part of

355
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
it. It's very beautifully done. You

356
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,639
don't have to read the whole thing.

357
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,800
Right.

358
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,040
Okay. So I said, "Why do people give

359
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,200
birth to autistic kids? Let me educate

360
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,880
you. There is no medical detection or

361
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,959
prenatal test to tell you that your

362
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,279
child will be born with autism. Even if

363
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,519
I had known about my son's autism prior

364
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,760
to his birth, I would still have chosen

365
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,480
to give him life. I went through five

366
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,000
miscarriages to finally give birth to

367
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,000
what I consider my miracle child. I

368
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,680
couldn't wait to hold him in my arms,

369
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,880
look into his eyes, and love him

370
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,560
forever. He is worth every resource that

371
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,839
will help bring out the best individual

372
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,600
he can be. He is worth every skill we

373
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,540
can teach him so that we may make his

374
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,669
life a little easier in the

375
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,669
[Applause]

376
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:25,680
future. Oh, sorry.

377
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,760
Protecting our children, your son, they

378
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,519
are emotional issues. What do you hope

379
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,680
people will take from your letter? Um I

380
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,600
you know one in 68 children are

381
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,600
diagnosed with autism today and that

382
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,760
number is rapidly growing and these

383
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,800
children cannot control the way their

384
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,600
brain functions. It's it's different but

385
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,800
not less

386
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:54,000
and I think that you know instead of

387
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,600
bullying have some compassion try to if

388
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,839
you don't understand something educate

389
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,680
yourself and try to understand it. try

390
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,240
to help and if you're not going to help,

391
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,720
at least don't

392
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,880
hurt. Um, so I I felt very passionately

393
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
about this as well. Our team started to

394
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,920
look for how this happened. The bullying

395
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,680
Facebook post was removed shortly after

396
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,360
it first appeared, as you know, but we

397
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,040
did some digging. We found the woman

398
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,320
that we believe to have posted it. Now,

399
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,160
we're not going to use her name because

400
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,240
she says her account was hacked and the

401
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,079
post was made by somebody else. She

402
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,279
tells us, and I'll quote her, "I do not

403
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,720
have any dislike of people with

404
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,560
disabilities. I'm just an ordinary

405
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,240
citizen trying to live my life in peace.

406
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,079
So either she's learned or she's

407
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,720
learning or maybe it wasn't her at all.

408
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,040
Yeah. But give us give us some hope in

409
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,320
this issue. What do you hope folks will

410
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,279
take away from this? You've been through

411
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,040
the bullying, many of us have

412
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,480
experienced it in different ways. How

413
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,560
can kids who are suffering from autism

414
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
and the millions of who are afflicted

415
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,760
because they're their families or love

416
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,920
them dearly, how do they react? What

417
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,800
should they take away from this story?

418
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,120
you know, when you when you see a child

419
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,639
um having a meltdown in public because

420
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,800
children on the spectrum, they become

421
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,320
very frustrated um because they can't

422
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,399
communicate

423
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
uh the way they want to. It's it's hard

424
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,800
for them to express their emotions and

425
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,720
control their emotions. And you know,

426
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,399
with that comes meltdowns. And sometimes

427
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,800
these meltdowns happen in public and

428
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,880
people look and they stare and they make

429
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,079
comments about the child or the parent.

430
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,040
And instead of saying something

431
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:22,920
mean-spirited, you know, and escalating

432
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,600
a situation that's already

433
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,759
uncomfortable, you know, just even a

434
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,839
look from somebody to say, you know, I

435
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,880
understand. I get it. And, you know,

436
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,240
don't worry about it. You know, carry

437
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,680
on, you know. So, I I'm so happy you

438
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
wrote the letter. I I thank you for

439
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,639
sticking up because it's a is a role

440
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,920
model for the rest of us. Thank you. All

441
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,000
right. And this year for me comes down

442
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,600
to one little boy, Nicholas, and the

443
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,880
millions of other kids with autism who

444
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,240
deserve our love, respect, and

445
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,600
compassion. Remember, whether you're

446
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,959
saying things to friends or posting

447
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,040
things online for the whole world to

448
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,040
see, your words matter. We'll be right

449
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,399
back. Have a health question? Ask on

453
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,160
Coming up next, a daughter wants to give

454
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,319
back to her hardworking mother who

455
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,319
spends all of her time helping others.

456
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,039
Always putting herself last. This

457
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,679
deserving mom needs some TLC. Yeah. Come

458
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,439
on out. A Mother's Day surprise. Coming

459
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,760
up next. All new Oz. Women who lost half

460
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,679
their body weight. Transformation. So

461
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,640
amazing, you have to see it to believe

462
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,200
it. I'm not g. If you think you can't

463
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,880
lose weight, think again. How they did

464
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,520
it so you can too. Plus, rip a page from

465
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,360
Laala Anony's power playbook. You can be

466
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,080
great at more than one thing. How she

467
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,760
went from the bottom to the top. Lala

468
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,400
sharing her rules. All new Oz. That's

469
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,400
coming up on

470
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Monday. For many of us, including me,

471
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,160
mothers are simply heroic. and I love

472
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
having you all here to celebrate you.

473
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,799
Let me give you a hand again. I love

474
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,640
having all the moms. It's often hard to

475
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,799
find the words to describe a mother's

476
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,480
love and then thank them for all they

477
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,679
do. That's why when I received this

478
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,840
letter from Emily about her

479
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,320
extraordinary mom, I wanted to help.

480
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,080
Take a look.

481
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,520
My mom, Gail, has had to endure more

482
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,840
than anyone should have to in their

483
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,440
entire lifetime. I'm a middle child and

484
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,039
I was born into a family with an older

485
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,960
sister, Julia, and a younger brother,

486
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,400
Christian.

487
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,840
Both of my siblings were born with

488
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,280
cystic fibrosis, a horrible

489
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,160
life-threatening disease, and my mom

490
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,600
took care of them every day. My sister

491
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,679
had to go through two double lung

492
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,640
transplants. In 2011, she succumbed to

493
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,640
the disease and passed

494
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,520
away. My little brother is only 22 and

495
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,240
still fighting the disease. My mom still

496
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,919
takes care of him every day. In addition

497
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,400
to this, she has worked as a nurse for

498
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,840
35 years to support the family. again,

499
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
spending all of her additional time

500
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,120
caring for others. She's got back

501
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,679
problems, arthritis, COPD, the physical

502
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,760
labor, the stress, the long hours and

503
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,440
shifts. It's definitely taken a toll on

504
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,480
her

505
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,039
health. I'd love to give her the

506
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,120
recognition she deserves and truly thank

507
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,120
her for giving up her life and sometimes

508
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,600
sanity, caring for myself and my

509
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,240
siblings.

510
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,320
Gail's daughter Emily is here. What do

511
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,960
you love the most about your mom? Well,

512
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,120
you know, my mom is so caring and she's

513
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,919
done so much for for my siblings

514
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,559
throughout the years and for myself. Um,

515
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,880
you know, even now she helps me she's

516
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,360
helped me to live out my dreams. Um, I'm

517
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,600
an entrepreneur and she's been such a

518
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,200
driving force behind me pursuing that.

519
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,360
Um, I know a lot of parents don't like

520
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,080
that. So,

521
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,360
she shows her love as most moms do. So,

522
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,039
why is it so important for you to

523
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,320
surprise her today? I just want to give

524
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,440
her a day of recognition um for her. And

525
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,480
what can I help you with? What's the

526
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,919
surprise gonna be? What do you want to

527
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,080
do to make her look different? I'd love

528
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,080
to give her a makeover. You know, she

529
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,240
doesn't really ever treat herself. She

530
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,160
shops at thrift stores. Um where's my

531
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,679
brother's hand-me-downs? Where's your

532
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,440
brother's hand? Yeah. She'd rather give

533
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,080
the resources, you know, to other

534
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,760
things. So, all right. So, since Gail

535
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,280
always puts herself last, we wanted to

536
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,280
help surprise her and give her a day

537
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,880
where she puts herself first. And this

538
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,520
is a remarkable, remarkable

539
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,200
transformation. Take a look.

540
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,039
Gail thinks she's keeping her daughter

541
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
company on a business trip in New York

542
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,559
City. Little does she know what we have

543
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,840
planned for her.

544
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey guys, come on in.

545
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,679
I have a very special surprise for you.

Hey Gail, Dr. Oz here. Your daughter

She told me how you're always putting

550
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,400
everyone else first. So today it's time

551
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,810

Pretty overwhelmed. Thank you, Dr. Oz.

Oh, I got to give you a hug. I got to

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,440
give. How are you, sir? How are you? How

584
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,360
are you? So, how does it feel to have

585
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,280
finally after doing things for everybody

586
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,440
else all the time to have a full day of

587
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,840
pampering? Well, first of all, I only

588
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,159
wear my brother's her brother's t-shirts

589
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,559
on his clothes. When I heard

590
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,640
that overwhelming, I don't I can't put

591
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,400
in words. It's just been just

592
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,799
overwhelming. Can't believe that all

593
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,840
this has happened in such a short frame

594
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,440
of m time. And I'm very grateful. Oh,

595
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,440
please God. We're grateful for you,

596
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,360
Emily. Really about your mom. She looks

597
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,120
great. And she did this. And that's

598
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,400
what's even more moving is that she did

599
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,919
this. So, thank you. Did you have any

600
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,480
idea any idea, Gail, that your daughter

601
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,080
was worrying this much about you? No. I

602
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,400
always said I was fine as long as I can

603
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,280
go out for a coffee or go to the library

604
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,280
or go for a walk. No, sir. I didn't. I

605
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,120
really didn't. Well, you know, I was

606
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,039
taught this by a gentleman when I was a

607
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,080
younger parent, and he said, "Always

608
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,520
remember, your kids aren't going to

609
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,320
treat themselves the way you treat them.

610
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
They're going to treat themselves the

611
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,400
way you treat yourself." So for all the

612
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,240
moms out there, if you want her to be as

613
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,440
beautiful and helping as you are, make

614
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,960
sure you're taking care of yourself as

615
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,640
well. God bless you for all you do for

616
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,640
your family. Thank you, sir. Now, I want

617
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,919
to thank all the moms out there. A big

618
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,440

651
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,600
We're back celebrating our moms and

652
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,520
today I'm sharing mom's bestkept

653
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,760
money-saving secrets. They're all brand

654
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,919
new and they only made the grade because

655
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,440
they've been road tested by a mom. Now,

656
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,760
our first secret comes from a mom who

657
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,240
says she tricks herself into saving

658
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,679
money. So, this is the basic concept.

659
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,320
How many of you have tossed spare change

660
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,320
into a jar like this? Let me see. Show

661
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,320
hands. All the mom satisfied. So,

662
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,919
Francis says she came up with something

663
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,000
even better. So, what is your money

664
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,400
saving secret? Well, growing up as a

665
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,159
child, we didn't have allowance. So, we

666
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,279
used to kind of save all our money in

667
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:34,159
the jar. But now that I'm an adult, my

668
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,480
husband and I, what we do is we save our

669
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,640
dollar bills. If there's any loose ones

670
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,760
around the house, we just dump them in a

671
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,400
box and we save them. And we keep this

672
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,799
box in our bedroom because we all know

673
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,240
that dollar bills are always safest in

674
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,520
the bedroom. They are safe there. Put

675
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,919
them in the mattress. So, when do you

676
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,440
look to see how much you saved at the We

677
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,720
typically we wait till the end of the

678
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,840
year. So, once you have a big

679
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,120
celebration, you pull it up. All right.

680
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,080
So, audience, let me come to you guys.

681
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,679
Thank you for that, Tim. I'm gonna come

682
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,679
back to you in a second. Let me see your

683
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,720
wallets. Put your wallets out. Listen,

684
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,679
get we get ones in there. Ones? No. No

685
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,360
ones. Only 20s. 20s and fives. Five.

686
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,679
Five. Big SP. You must have given them

687
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,240
away. You have ones here. I have ones.

688
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,559
There are a lot of ones here. Look at

689
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,240
that. Think about all these ones. Would

690
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,840
you think would you consider doing what

691
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,039
we're being advised taking these ones

692
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,960
and putting them in a box? Maybe. Maybe.

693
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,480
So, if we did that, Francis, in your

694
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,159
case, when you do this little exercise,

695
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,960
how much money do you end up with at the

696
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,760
end of a year? Well, we typically save

697
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,360
anywhere between $300.

698
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,640
300 bucks. $300. I'd do that. That's

699
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,880
better than the change counter over

700
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,039
there. I like that idea very much. Thank

701
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,559
you for your advice. Keep saving. Thank

702
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,320
you. Love what you do. All right. Next,

703
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,320
we want to find ways of saving money at

704
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,799
meal time. Don is a mother of three.

705
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,559
She's busy. She says there was a time

706
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,320
that she was spending way more than she

707
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,960
wanted to on food, so she came up with a

708
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,640
plan to cut costs. What's the secret?

709
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,480
The secret that I have in my family is

710
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,919
we do at least three meatless meals a

711
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,440
week. And we do here's a frittata, which

712
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,480
you know is easy to sneak in a little

713
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,559
spinach, which is a favorite. Uh also a

714
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,559
black bean burger, which is my husband's

715
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,080
favorite. And finally, for all working

716
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,679
moms, I work actually work on a farm.

717
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,200
And it's great to throw all kinds of

718
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,520
vegetables in here. And at the end of

719
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,039
the day, you work on a farm. I do. I do.

720
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,720
Where do you live? I live in Cranford,

721
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,240
New Jersey. Good for you. There's farms

722
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,799
in New Jersey now. Yeah. It's the last

723
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,559
one in New Jersey. Do the kids mind when

724
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,919
you make these meatless dishes? No,

725
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,320
actually, they love it. Especially the

726
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,919
eggs because eggs is a great uh way to

727
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,360
sneak things in. Like I said, something

728
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,600
like spinach and a lot of cheese in

729
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,279
there, too. Not too much, but enough to

730
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,840
make that tasty for them. So, if folks

731
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,400
right now move from having meat to a

732
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,760
meatless uh option three times a week,

733
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,080
yeah, they could copy you. How much

734
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,000
money do you roughly save? At least $30

735
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,799
a week. And that's not even counting the

736
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,520
health benefits. $30 a week. So, in a

737
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,520
year, that is $1,500.

738
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,880
Just do the math for everybody else.

739
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,039
What do you do with all the extra cash?

740
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,200
You could buy a car. I know. Well, my my

741
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,360
my two girls have very expensive tastes.

742
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,880
They love to horseback ride. And so,

743
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,480
it's a nice hobby to do. I do. I believe

744
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,320
I have the same problem. By the way,

745
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,520
enjoy farming. Thanks for being so much.

746
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,039
All right. Our next mom has three kids.

747
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,120
She says she's found a great way to find

748
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,520
extra cash. She says her money saving

749
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,880
secret is all about rounding. Now, most

750
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,120
folks are intimidated by rounding. They

751
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,880
heard about in math class. So, explain

752
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,279
it to us all. Well, I like math. So,

753
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,600
rounding, I like to round up when I'm

754
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,200
paying my bills and take the extra

755
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,600
money. So, if I have a cable bill, let's

756
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,679
say that's $85, which we know the cable

757
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,440
bill is a lot more than $85, but it is.

758
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,039
I'll round up to 90 and I'll put that $5

759
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,799
in savings. And then when I'm putting

760
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,120
deposits in the bank, I round down. So

761
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,120
if I have a check for $185, I'll take

762
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,440
$10 off the top and put that in savings

763
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,039
and just put the other 175 where I pay

764
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,480
my bills from so that I have this money

765
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,919
that I don't even see, but it it

766
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,640
accumulates over time. Yeah. So your

767
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,320
checking account actually purposely

768
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,240
underestimates how much money you have

769
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,480
there. Yes. Well, I actually I actually

770
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,679
opened a separate account that I try not

771
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,960
to touch. You know, it's the it's the

772
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,240
savings account. I have three boys at

773
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,919
home. we're saving for college and this

774
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,200
is the money that you know when we can

775
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,640
spare it, we put it in there and we

776
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,000
don't spend it. What gave you the idea

777
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,000
of doing this? You know, I'd like to say

778
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,039
it was my idea, but I had heard on the

779
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,880
um radio about a bank that offered a

780
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,880
debit card. It was like a a bank card

781
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,159
where they would round up the change and

782
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,440
do that for savings. And I thought, I

783
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,880
don't need a bank card to do that. I can

784
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,240
just do it with my own money. So, give

785
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,039
me an idea of how much money we're

786
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,000
talking about at the end of the year.

787
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,000
How much can you save? Um, you know

788
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,960
what? Probably about $100 a month. So,

789
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,039
it's like $1,200 a year. $1,200 a year.

790
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,600
Yeah. So, put this together, everybody.

791
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:39,480
If you do all these secrets, it's

792
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,840
roughly $3,000 a

793
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,440
year. You might as well enjoy it, cuz

794
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,720
you're saving money without realizing

795
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,360

surprised?

Do you have a favorite $1 fix that you

799
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,880
use in the kitchen? I never buy store

800
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,320
brand salad dressing. It's way too

801
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,399
expensive and often packed with

802
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,320
unnecessary ingredients and calories. I

803
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,480
use lemon juice and olive oil. Saves

for her child. A young child fighting

for her life. The battle to get her a

lung transplant even when the law said

no. What she did to fight the system and

transplants too. An inspiring Mother's

lost half their body weight.

Transformation so amazing you have to

815
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,320
see it to believe it. I'm not giving. If

816
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,679
you think you can't lose weight, think

817
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,320
again. How they did it so you can too.

824
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,480
Monday. Lots of moms and daughters in

825
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,640
the audience. Are you always fighting to

826
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,320
protect each other? Yeah. Yeah, you are.

827
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,720
Well, today I've got a story about two

828
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,480
fighters. A mom fighting for her child

829
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,120
and her daughter fighting for her life.

830
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,720
Janet Burnan made national headlines two

831
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,720
years ago when she fought for her

832
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,720
10-year-old daughter Sarah to have a

833
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,399
lung

834
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,559
transplant. Sarah suffers from cystic

835
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,880
fibrosis, a life-threatening illness

836
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,360
that targets the lungs. Her condition

837
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,159
was so severe her doctor predicted that

838
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,880
she had only weeks to live unless she

839
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,640
received a successful lung transplant.

[Music]

841
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,559
But federal policy prevented children

842
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,360
under the age of 12 from being

843
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,840
considered for an adult lung. Janet

844
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,799
launched a massive publicity campaign to

845
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,720
change the under2 policy and filed a

846
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,480
lawsuit against the federal government

847
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,559
claiming the system discriminated

848
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,919
against

849
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,919
children. She also took the fight to

850
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,480
social media. Family and friends

851
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,880
circulated a petition on change.org

852
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,760
which collected over 370,000 signatures.

853
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,159
The grassroots effort paid off. The

854
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,000
transplant network created an exception,

855
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,960
making Sarah eligible to receive an

856
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,519
adult lung

857
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,120
transplant. The first surgery

858
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,360
failed. But after 3 days in critical

859
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,279
condition and on life support, Sarah

860
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,559
received a second

861
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,200
transplant. This time, the high-risisk

862
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,760
operation was a success.

863
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,000
It took six long months to recover, but

864
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,720
Sarah was finally able to return home to

865
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,799
her family.

866
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,919
Janet and Fran Mahan and their daughter

867
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,519
Sarah are all joining us. I like I like

868
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,279
the thumbs up. How you feeling with your

869
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:54,799
new lungs? Um, it's going really well.

870
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,840
Um, I've been able to run around outside

871
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,760
and um go to the pool and I've been

872
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,080
learning how to ride my bike. You're

873
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,320
riding your bike now? Yes. That can be

874
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,840
dangerous.

875
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,799
Are you happy being able to do all these

876
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,760
new things you couldn't do before? Yes.

877
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:14,640
Have you seen lungs before? Um, I've

878
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,240
seen a picture of them, but I didn't

879
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,000
actually see them like in real life

880
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,279
before. Like maybe like the way you're

881
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,559
going to see them in a minute under that

882
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,399
towel. Yeah. You want you want to see

883
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,080
them under the towel? Yes, I do want to

884
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,279
see. You do? Come on over here. So, here

885
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,440
your purple gloves. Goes with your

886
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,960
dress, by the way. Here, mom and dad.

887
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,880
You take a look at these as well. Let me

888
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,640
show you what your lungs look like. And

889
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,559
just so we're all on the same page here

890
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,120
because this was a lifesaving

891
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,279
intervention mom did. Sarah didn't get

892
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,640
just Are you ready, Sarah? Hold on. You

893
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,080
ready? I got She wants me to hold on.

894
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,159
I'm going to hold on. Just put them on

895
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,519
my gloves.

896
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,600
The gloves a little big for you, but

897
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,080
they the color goes well with your eyes.

898
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,200
All right. So, you didn't just get one

899
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,559
lung, you got two lungs.

900
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,120
So, that's what they look like. You can

901
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,120
go ahead and touch them.

902
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
What do you think about

903
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,720
them? You playing an instrument. What

904
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,720
are you? They don't make any

905
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,639
noise. You can pick them up. See, these

906
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,480
they're just squishy feeling. They are

907
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,560
squishy feeling. Don't drop them now.

908
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,000
But lungs are unique and they blow up

909
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,359
with air and they do all kinds of

910
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,200
miraculous things and they're very

911
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,200
delicate. So when they're destroyed and

912
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,919
we replace them, it's a big operation.

913
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,760
And you can see these are adult lungs. M

914
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,440
they do fit in the children and we can

915
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,919
do things to make them fit, but it's not

916
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,639
always an easy match. That's important

917
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,639
because Sarah was only 10 years old when

918
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,079
she needed the transplant and she wasn't

919
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,639
considered first on the transplant

920
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,720
waiting list for adults, only for kids.

921
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,320
So, Fran, how did you react finding out

922
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,839
that your daughter would probably die

923
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,359
because she couldn't get listed on that

924
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,000
adult list? I was shocked because Sarah

925
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,079
has had cystic fibrosis her entire life.

926
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,240
So, we knew at some point it was going

927
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,280
to be challenging, but what really was

928
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,920
really shocking was the fact that that

929
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,560
someone else who was much healthier than

930
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,119
her would probably get lungs before her

931
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,000
just because of her age. You okay with

932
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,480
those lungs?

933
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,560
You know, it's these organs are so

934
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,920
sacred when we do transplants. I always

935
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,440
think about that as you're putting them

936
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,440
into people because it is truly the gift

937
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,720
of life. But when these lists and you

938
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,960
know these lists are created by good,

939
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,680
well-meaning people, but they sometimes

940
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,200
have gaps in them. So Janet, how does it

941
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,119
feel to know that because of your

942
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,720
petitioning and pushing and shoving, you

943
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,640
not only saved your daughter's life, but

944
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,960
many others now because you created an

945
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,760
exemption on this pediatric list? Well,

946
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,480
of course, it was amazing to save Sarah

947
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,960
and very surreal, but we always wanted

948
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,160
to make the change for all kids. It was

949
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,000
never just about Sarah for us. Um, so we

950
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,440
feel really, really proud. At night, we

951
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,880
still go in and look at her breathing.

952
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,640
You know, it's just an amazing thing

953
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,880
just to see her breathing like any other

954
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,359
kid. Never take that for granted again.

955
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,560
Parents do that a lot. Brent, who's the

956
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,720
bigger fighter in the family, your wife

957
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,359
or your daughter?

958
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,680
Sarah. I think Sarah most definitely. Um

959
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,680
she

960
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,880
went she I mean through the entire

961
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:19,079
process and just her entire life she's

962
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,359
always effortlessly fought never

963
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,599
complained and there was one point

964
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,520
actually when we were in the ICU when we

965
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,560
asked her you know that this is really

966
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,960
rough this is tough I mean at any point

967
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,000
this is too much for you let us know and

968
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,359
she looked up and gave us this look and

969
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,200
little sly look like she's kind of

970
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,960
giving out and she she said that she

971
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,240
never wants to give up and she never

972
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,359
wanted us to give up for her.

973
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,599
So Sarah, what's next for you besides

974
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:53,359
playing with the organs? What are you

975
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:57,040
hoping for next? Um I want to be on the

976
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:59,680
swim team um with my brother and sister

977
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,640
Sean and Ella. So, I'm going to do like

978
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,800
lots of courage to ask you so you don't

979
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,480
have to do anything in the fall or the

980
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,160
winter. Nothing's going to hold you

981
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,520
back, my dear. Nothing whatsoever. I'm

982
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,200
very proud of you and your parents as

1019

[Music]

1020
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,359
With Mother's Day just two days away,

1021
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,040
here's a little history lesson about the

1022
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,839
celebration. It all started with a woman

1023
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,079
named Anna Jarvis, who wanted to honor

1024
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,960
her mother, a Civil War peace activist

1025
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,040
who died in 1905. Now, Jarvis pushed for

1026
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,920
a national holiday to pay homage to all

1027
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,079
mothers. And in 1914, President Woodrow

1028
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,400
Wilson signed the proclamation making

1029
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,320
the second Sunday in May the National

1030
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,079
Mother's Day holiday that we celebrate

1031
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,400
today. So to all the mothers out there,

1032
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,240
especially my dear Lisa and Daphne, who

1033
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,400
are both mothers now, happy Mother's

1034
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,800
Day. Now it's time for you in case you

1035
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,400
missed it. First, Mom's bestkept

1036
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,000
money-saving secrets. Believe it or not,

1037
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,760
you can save money at meal time by

1038
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,920
introducing your family to vegetarian

1039
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,000
and meatless meals a few times a week.

1040
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,680
You can make meatless meals like this

1041
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,040
Crock-Pot vegetarian chili, which is

1042
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,119
super easy to make. You can save time

1043
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,320
and it tastes out of this world. They

1044
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,480
have a black bean burger. I'm going to

1045
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,640
have all these recipes on dr.com. And

1046
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,040
eggs are fantastic source of protein.

1047
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,520
Healthy omelets can uh be made. And by

1048
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,560
doing this, you can easily save 30 bucks

1049
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,800
a week. $30 a week. That's about

1050
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,480
$1,500 per year. Even better, healthy

1051
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,480
vegetarian diets are typically low in

1052
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,400
fat and high in fiber. Here's another

1053
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,400
great tip that's mom approved. Instead

1054
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,240
of putting just loose change in a jar,

1055
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,599
you should do this, too. You know, save

1056
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,680
that money. It makes a difference. But

1057
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,000
take it one step further and toss the

1058
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,240
singles from your wallet into the shoe

1059
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,240
box each night. When you do that, those

1060
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,839
$1 or $2 a night add up pretty quickly

1061
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,440
to a savings of $300 a year. And that I

1062
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,839
think is a reasonable chunk of change to

1063
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,599
make something good in your life happen.

1064
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,079
And another show off with Kelly Roland,

1065
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,839
who I adore, and she speaks to the

1066
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,839
beauty of life when this new child came

1067
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,440
into her existence, but then she lost

1068
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,119
her mom tragically. And for Mother's

1069
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,119
Day, I want us all to think about the

1070
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,560
one thing we really appreciate about our

1071
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,240
moms, besides the fact they gave birth

1072
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,720
to us. So, who wants to go first? Who

1073
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,480
loves their mom? Har, what's your name?

1074
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,960
Christine Welker. So, what's special

1075
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,960
about mom? What's special about mom?

1076
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,359
Well, I'd say that she taught me how to

1077
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,720
be strong, passionate, and love

1078
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,119
everything I do. Is that right? I hope

1079
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,800
so. Yes, it is. How about you over here?

1080
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,000
Um, my mom has got me through good times

1081
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,160
and bad times, and she's my rock. Is

1082
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,760
that your sister over there? It is. Hi.

1083
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,560
What's your name? Melissa. Melissa. To

1084
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,480
top your sister now. It's a competition

1085
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,480
here. We're trying to beat each other.

1086
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,200
She's taught me how to operate a

1087
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,720
kitchen, how to cook. I wouldn't have

1088
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,640
known how to turn the oven on if it

1089
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:21,040
wasn't for her. So, thanks, Mom.

1090
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,800
Head down to your college over there.

1091
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,800
I'm definitely thankful for my mom

1092
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,280
working so hard, sending me to a great

1093
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,400
school. Definitely my education for my

1094
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,760
mom. Now, is now is mom that's grandma

1095
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,599
there? All right. So, what do you have

1096
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,400
to say for grandma? I am so grateful my

1097
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,480
mother gave me my sense of humor.

1098
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,800
Is your mom funny? No, you're not that

1099
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,800
funny. Mom,

1100
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,359
so is that mom, grandma, you get to She

1101
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,280
is funny. She is funny. Well, her

1102
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:51,520
daughter has this. So, I was I had this

1103
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,400
big vision in my in my home for a book I

1104
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,319
was going to write. It was going to be a

1105
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,800
comedy book. So, I was talking to my

1106
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,480
wife about it and she was very drolly

1107
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,240
acknowledging that it wasn't going to be

1108
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,400
very good. So, I finally thought I'd go

1109
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,359
to my daughter to get an arbitration.

1110
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,640
So, I went to my daughter. I said,

1111
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,560
"Honey, don't you don't you love this

1112
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,880
idea? It's so cool. And she looked at me

1113
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,480
very calmly and she said, "It would be a

1114
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,920
funny book if funny people wrote

1115
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,079
it." So, I love you all for Mother's

1116
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,400
Day. Thank you for being here. And I got
