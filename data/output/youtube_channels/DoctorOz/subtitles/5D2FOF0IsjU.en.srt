1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,120
It may be the most famous cold case of

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,599
the last century. This unknown serial

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,080
killer claimed to have murdered 37

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,160
people. He flaunted his crimes by

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,160
sending letters like these to the police

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,080
and the press. The mystery surrounding

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,279
his identity has inspired countless

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,880
books, movies, and TV programs. He is

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,880
the Zodiac Killer. But 50 years after

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,760
he's believed to have murdered his first

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,359
victim, could new DNA technology finally

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,680
identify him? Today, you're going to

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,440
hear exclusive details and insights from

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,360
investigators who believe they may

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,320
finally be able to bring this infamous

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,320
killer to

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,280
justice. In the 70s, as it was

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
happening, a lot of us probably thought,

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,800
gee, there's a lot going on. But looking

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,600
back at a decade of violence, it was

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,920
just crazy. It was crazy time. Most

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,480
serial killers don't make any effort to

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,399
involve the media or investigators.

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,320
They're very secretive. They don't want

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,400
attention. They almost want their crimes

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,400
to go unnoticed. But the idea of

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,880
committing a crime and then calling up

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,000
the police and bragging about it, that's

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,320
a whole another level of terror. A man

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,320
who wore a medieval style executioner's

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,799
hood who has baffled the police and

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,560
baffled the media. He seems to crave

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,400
publicity. He sent letters and

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
cryptograms to newspapers and the

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
police. Subject stated, "I want to

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,200
report a murder." No, a double murder. I

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,000
did it. Here we are 50 years after the

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,000
first Zodiac killing. In today's world

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,920
of forensics, old cases are being

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,920
solved. We're talking about probably the

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,400
most famous cold case in the last

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,119
century or so in terms of its drama and

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,560
being unsolved. Who doesn't want to know

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,439
how it turns out?

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,479
Dear editor, this is the Zodiac

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,720
speaking. If you do not print this

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,960
cipher by the afternoon of Friday, 1st

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,680
of August, I will go on a kill rampage

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,200
Friday night. I will cruise around all

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,640
weekend killing lone people in the

51
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,599
night, then move on to kill again. The

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,319
best part of it is that when I die, I'll

53
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,520
be reborn in paradise, and all that I

54
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,520
have killed will become my slaves.

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,599
Wow. Matt Frederick and Payne Lindsay

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,560
are here. They're the hosts of the

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,400
podcast Monster the Zodiac Killer. Pay,

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,239
there's been so much written about this

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
monster. So much said about him. Why do

60
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,120
you want to tackle this cold case? Well,

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,760
man, it's been 50 years. 50 years since

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,760
the first Zodiac killing. It's unsolved.

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,640
Police have never arrested anyone for

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,239
these murders at all. Imagine that. All

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,440
these people dead. Nothing known about

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,879
it. Matt, the randomness of these crimes

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,800
is one of the biggest problems it would

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,800
seem if I was law enforcement. It is.

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,280
Yeah. Each one each of the five

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,080
confirmed attacks where people were

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,560
killed. They all occurred in different

72
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,000
jurisdictions. So, I mean, at the very

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
beginning, you have to have all of these

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,400
police departments working together,

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,080
which is a difficult thing to do. So,

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,840
for years, the the primary most

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
scrutinized suspect was a man named

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,400
Arthur Lee. Allen. Mhm. Matt actually

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,920
spoke to a father and son who knew him.

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,319
So, let's listen to what they had to

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,599
say. I knew Arthur Lee Allen in school.

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,879
He was uh a half a grade behind me, but

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,640
we knew each other. And um and then

84
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,959
later on he would come in his shop once

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,080
in a while. He worked on his car. So, he

86
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,360
did blacksmith work. He came in one time

87
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,760
and and said, "Hey, I have this letter."

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,480
He just said that he was no longer a

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,159
suspect in the Zodiac case. He also told

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,560
me once that he needed that letter cuz

91
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,480
he kind of couldn't get a job. Yeah, it

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,519
was just weird to think that I knew the

93
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,280
guy as a kid. I knew my dad knew him. It

94
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,360
It's one of those things that I would

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,920
love to know what the real answer is. I

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,319
would love to know if it was him. I've

97
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,799
seen other suspects name, but obviously

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,799
the only one that is in my head is is

99
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,959
Lee Allen. I certainly believe he could

100
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,879
have been

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
So Matt, the these two had never spoken

102
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,200
out before. Why was it important to hear

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,439
them? Well, these guys had just a

104
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,479
personal perspective on the man Arthur

105
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,639
Lee Allen. And this is this is a guy

106
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,560
who's there's so many stories told about

107
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,720
him. There are so many um

108
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,400
ideas that say he's the guy. And it's

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,840
all it's almost all circumstantial

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600
evidence when you look at him because

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,520
when police officers actually

112
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,759
investigated this man, they couldn't

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,000
connect any of the actual evidence to

114
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,560
him as being the Zodiac Killer. And

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,040
hearing uh the perspective of a person

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,199
that knew Arthur, that was Carl Lubner

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,199
you were listening to. Uh it lets you

118
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,560
see the person behind kind of the myth.

119
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,360
This letter is sort of strange. I I

120
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
didn't know you could go to the police

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,320
and get a letter saying that you're

122
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,520
innocent of something. Yeah.

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know if they still do that, but

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,840
is was it legit? Well, yeah. There was

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,479
there was so much press surrounding this

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,639
man, and this is in the '9s when this

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,639
occurred uh when he brought in the the

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,080
letter to show them because he had been

129
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,720
there, you know, he had been

130
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,000
um thought to be the Zodiac. In a lot of

131
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,400
people's minds, because there's so much

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,759
press, people think this is the guy. And

133
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,360
if he's going to go out and, you know,

134
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,199
get a job somewhere, you're going to

135
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,600
interview and say, "Yeah, possibly the

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,759
Zodiac Killer. You need something I mean

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,919
you need something official that says no

138
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,080
I am not according to the police.

139
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,919
Although that at the time the gathering

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,240
of of information of evidence wasn't

141
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,520
quite so good. So he could have been Zad

142
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,720
killer just not have been tied because

143
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,960
they didn't have evidence that we have

144
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
today. But part of what comes to my mind

145
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,160
is Mark's memory that the young the

146
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,320
younger the son's memory in that video

147
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,639
you just listen watched and listened to

148
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,960
of the school bus was important because

149
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,320
he had a fear and that fear came from a

150
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,080
letter where the Zodiac killer wrote I'm

151
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,160
going to quote him. I think I shall wipe

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,280
out a school bus some morning. There

153
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,199
were police who were following school

154
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,120
buses around. But in a later letter, he

155
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
seems to have changed his his mind and

156
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
his heart when he wrote, "If you cops

157
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
think I'm going to take on a school bus

158
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,120
the way I stated I would, you deserve to

159
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,800
have holes in your heads." What struck

160
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
you the most pain about not just this

161
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,600
letter, but his whole attitude towards

162
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,120
law enforcement and the public? This guy

163
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,080
is just pompous. He's cocky. He doesn't

164
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,759
care. He He wants to taunt the police.

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,600
He wants to brag about these murders.

166
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,800
He's not hiding the fact that he's a

167
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,800
killer. Did you believe that he may have

168
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,720
wanted the attention, Matt, because

169
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,680
there there was another killer in the

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
area at the time? Yes. Uh a man named

171
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,199
Charles Manson that you might recognize.

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,880
Uh he he was making

173
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:43,759
headlines right after the Paul Stein

174
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,759
murder, which is uh 1969. and and he

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,400
begins writing letters to the Chronicle,

176
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,000
the San Francisco Chronicle, as all of

177
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,240
these front page stories about Manson

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,560
are occurring. And it's almost as if he

179
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,720
wants to get the attention back. That's

180
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,080
what it really feels like because, you

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,479
know, after that point, while the

182
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,199
Charles Manson story is occurring, he's

183
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,199
not writing any details about killings.

184
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,960
So, there are all of these people that

185
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,800
he claims to have killed, but there's

186
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,639
absolutely no evidence that he had

187
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,720
anything to do with it. How many people

188
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,199
did he claim to have killed? It was I

189
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,160
think 49 is what Robert Gaymith writes

190
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,240
down in uh the book Zodiac. Oh my

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,919
goodness. Pay, what do you hope people

192
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,160
listeners get from your podcast? Because

193
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,440
you guys do a really detailed dive into

194
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,919
all the clues out there. I think it's

195
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,919
been so long. We we wanted a place where

196
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,280
all this information could live. It's

197
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,360
been 50 years and if there's a missing

198
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,720
piece of information out there, if

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,039
someone saw something or heard

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,880
something, now's the time to give us a

201
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,599
call. Hey, even the Zodiac Killer

202
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,639
himself, if you're in a retirement home

203
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,560
watching this on TV, write me a letter.

204
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,199
Let's get all the information out there.

205
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,080
Uh, time's slipping. I mean, not all the

206
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,319
people in this case are going to be

207
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,479
around in 10 years. It's not your ally

208
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,240
in this case to have time. Up next,

209
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,160
who's a Zodiac Killer? We investigate

210
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
the theory surrounding his identity and

211
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,479
how he might finally be caught. Stay

212
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,520
with us. The boy thought he was going to

213
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,960
wasn't going to make it. He wanted to

214
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,800
tell give a description to the guy best

215
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,759
he

216
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,319
could about the best he could give us

217
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,960
that he had a hood over his face and a

218
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,479
he was a big guy.

219
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,879
U 6 foot of better over 200 lb. That's a

220
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,280
clip from 1969 of a police officer

221
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,280
reporting on a survivor's description

222
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,479
Zodiac Killer. And we're back with this

223
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,720
cold case that has frustrated

224
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,719
authorities for 50 years. The Zodiac

225
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,760
Killer terrorized Northern California,

226
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,159
claiming to have murdered 37 people. He

227
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,839
has never been identified, but now DNA

228
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,599
technology could change that. Here to

229
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,159
help unravel the mystery surrounding the

230
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,000
Zodiac Killer is our true crime panel.

231
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
CRAM correspondent Melissa Moore,

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,360
retired police sergeant and host of

233
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,760
Breaking Homicide on Investigation

234
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,519
Discovery, Derek Levasser, and former

235
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,600
homicide prosecutor and host of True

236
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,320
Conviction on Investigation Discovery.

237
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,640
An NLI ana 50 years, a long time. He was

238
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,000
pretty good at covering his tracks. All

239
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,920
this time we've been searching for him.

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,800
What does that tell you about him? Tells

241
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,200
me that he benefited from the days. This

242
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,800
is the days before DNA. We did not have

243
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
video surveillance like we do today

244
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,480
everywhere. So whether is that he is

245
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,080
incredibly savvy, which we know he's

246
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,320
intelligent from the way he went about

247
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,800
his letters and these cryptograms, these

248
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,800
puzzles he put in them, but it's also

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,360
right place, right time. He committed

250
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,120
his crimes at night. I would like to

251
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,480
believe that today we would not have

252
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,959
what some have called this greatest

253
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,640
America's murder mystery on our hands

254
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,640
because he would not have benefited from

255
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,640
the lack of technology that we now have

256
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,320
today. And Derek, in addition to being

257
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,480
very well organized, he was incredibly

258
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
random in his acts. What does that tell

259
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,080
you about who he is? Well, it may not be

260
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,839
random at all. You know, serial killers

261
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,760
can have a pattern, but I believe they

262
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,680
tend to look for victims of opportunity,

263
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,200
right? So, when they see someone who's

264
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,720
vulnerable, they tend to act upon it.

265
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,720
When you think about the first killing

266
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,920
associated with the Zodiac Killer, it

267
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,440
was uh December 20th, 1968, 11:30 p.m.

268
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,760
Two victims were teenagers. You had

269
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
David Faraday and David Faraday and

270
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Betty Lou Jensen. They were teenagers.

271
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,600
They were parked in a car in a dark area

272
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,040
and they were shot and killed. Do I

273
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,959
think the Zodiac Killer knew they were

274
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,800
going to be there? No. But he saw an

275
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,160
opportunity to kill two people without

276
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
being apprehended because nobody was

277
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,600
around and he took advantage of it. But

278
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,160
they were on Lover's Lane, I believe.

279
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Right. So, he knew there would be young

280
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,760
people who loved each other. They were

281
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,279
together. They could pray on, Melissa,

282
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,120
looking at this cold case file. What

283
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,200
stands out to you? Well, what stands out

284
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,959
to me is just the time lapse in the

285
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,360
killing. Like, this happened in the 60s

286
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,720
and the I think the last one was in the

287
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,480
early 70s that he he killed. So normally

288
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,360
ser serial killers don't go underground

289
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,600
for that long. So I'm curious why the

290
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
long lapse in time that he hasn't killed

291
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,480
again unless he hasn't talked about it

292
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,079
and he actually has killed again. Do you

293
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,800
think the Zodiac Killer could still be

294
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,120
alive? Absolutely. I think he could be

295
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,000
alive. We just recently found the Golden

296
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,320
State serial killer and he's obviously

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,760
older but we believe that he started

298
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,839
killing. The Zodiac started killing him

299
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,079
in the mid 20s. So from age 25 to 35. So

300
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,680
he's he definitely could still be alive.

301
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,279
So over the years several people have

302
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,279
been interviewed as possible suspects

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,760
based on circumstantial evidence and in

304
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,000
some cases pure speculation. So Arthur

305
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,079
Lee Allen was portrayed as the prime

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
suspect in the movie Zodiac. That was

307
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,120
what we just talked about that

308
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
gentleman. Was he really a serious

309
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,959
potential suspect for police? He was

310
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,360
absolutely a serious suspect. This is a

311
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,440
case that over 2,000 people have been

312
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,360
named as potential suspects. But he came

313
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,920
up over and over again for several

314
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,680
reasons. One, he was actually seen in

315
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,440
the vicinity of a couple of the murders

316
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,600
that happened about 6 months after the

317
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,000
Zodiac spree began, or at least that we

318
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
know of. A friend of his reported only a

319
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
year later that he had talked about his

320
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,560
desire to kill, that he liked using the

321
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,399
name Zodiac. Strange coincidence if they

322
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,440
were. He had a watch that was by the

323
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,519
brand Zodiac. He talked about wanting to

324
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,040
put a flashlight on a firearm so he

325
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,040
could see better at night. Now, several

326
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,120
search warrants were conducted of his

327
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,040
home over the years. When he died, which

328
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
was in

329
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,839
1992, they did a search of his home and

330
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,760
took evidence. I also think it's very

331
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,760
important to point out in fairness that

332
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,800
when they did look at a partial print

333
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,399
and a partial genetic profile DNA of

334
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
his, they were not a match to the

335
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,360
Zodiac. So, that means that that

336
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,680
certainly wasn't him. Does it

337
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,920
conclusively prove it wasn't him? No.

338
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,279
And the fingerprint, who knows? It could

339
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,639
have just been an arbitrary fingerprint.

340
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't There was so little evidence,

341
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,120
it's hard to tie that all together. In

342
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,639
fact, there are a lot of conspiracy

343
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,959
theories, Melissa, because of that,

344
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,880
because there's an easy way of making up

345
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,519
stories about who the Zodiac Killer is.

346
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,399
I think the most absurd one is that the

347
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,760
theorist is that the Texas Senator Ted

348
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,279
Cruz is the is the culprit. But, I mean,

349
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,880
he was born two years after the first

350
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,519
known killing, so that's not possible.

351
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,120
Then you saw like there's also Manson

352
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,920
that they think members of the family of

353
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,720
the Manson uh were, you know, committing

354
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,120
these crimes. Uh, also lately there's

355
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,279
been a lot of people saying my relative

356
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,519
is the Zodiac Killer. So this is this

357
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,440
call. It's screaming for some help.

358
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,920
Derek the Zodiac Killer like other

359
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,480
serial killers was taunting the media

360
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,480
taunting police. So as a police officer,

361
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
retired officer, what do those what do

362
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,839
those actions tell you about his crimes

363
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,880
and and who he is about his identity?

364
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,320
Well, he's not much different than

365
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,160
killers today, right? It's not it's

366
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,920
about notoriety. It's not enough just to

367
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
commit the heinous act. They want people

368
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,519
to know they got away with it.

369
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,040
Ironically, that self-confidence can

370
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,800
sometimes lead to a false sense of

371
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,079
security, which will ultimately get them

372
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,839
caught. You look at the uni bomber,

373
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,880
right? He started getting cocky. He

374
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,720
started writing these letters, this

375
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,639
manifesto, and that's why he was

376
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,399
ultimately arrested. So, it could end up

377
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,760
coming back to bite him in the end. Can

378
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,200
Can I ask you a difficult question? You

379
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,040
know, that's it's it's one that I think

380
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,360
might startle the audience. He claims to

381
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,839
have killed 37 people, right? Five we

382
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,680
actually know he killed, but the other

383
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,600
ones we we're not sure about. How many

384
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,120
people could he have actually killed?

385
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,560
The numbers are unlimited. I mean, we

386
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,360
may never know exactly how many people

387
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,639
he killed. Sometimes serial killers will

388
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
tend to take credit for murders they

389
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,680
didn't commit to kind of create their

390
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,240
own narrative and and boost their own

391
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,839
egos. Um, but at the end of the day,

392
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
when investigators are looking at it,

393
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,279
there may be cases that look similar to

394
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,800
past killings of the Zodiac. They may

395
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,800
associate it with them. And then there

396
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,240
are outliers that aren't exactly the

397
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,079
same exact situation. You may have a

398
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,160
different type of victim, manner of

399
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,160
death, but they are connected. So, as

400
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,480
far as pinpointing the exact number, we

401
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,720
may never know. So, so what percentage

402
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
of murders go unsolved in America? Well,

403
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,160
the national number number is

404
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,480
approximately 40%.

405
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,959
How how many of you knew that 40% of all

406
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,959
murders go unsolved?

407
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,480
They're like five people max and we have

408
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,399
the smartest audience in television.

409
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
True. That that's that's remarkable.

410
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,560
That's absolutely remarkable. Well,

411
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,079
that's why we do what we do. That's why

412
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,839
as a private investigator you try to

413
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,760
help out because again a lot of

414
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,199
situations law enforcement is inundated

415
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,399
with cases and they can only spend so

416
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,839
much time on it. They follow up the

417
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,079
leads and they kind of have to put it

418
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
aside and wait for a lead and you know

419
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,360
but we can't do that. We have to keep

420
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,120
pursuing it for the hopefully technology

421
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
today can help us look back which is

422
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,120
exactly what you're hearing here with

423
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,800
the success of the Golden State DNA.

424
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,160
That is exactly what prompted people to

425
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,160
now start looking at this again to see

426
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,000
if advancements in technology. Homicides

427
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,440
are never closed. Every family deserves

428
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
an answer. So, let's hope that we can

429
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
look back and solve more of those that

430
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,920
are why we do the show cuz forensics

431
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
science is playing a bigger role. So,

432
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,000
don't get any ideas. Up next, could

433
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,839
those popular DNA tests be the key to

434
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,320
cracking the Zodiac Killer mystery? Stay

435
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,480
with us. We're back asking the question,

436
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,480
who is the Zodiac Killer? After 50

437
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,560
years, police may have finally found the

438
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,399
key to identifying the serial killer who

439
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,720
terrorized Northern California and then

440
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,160
seemingly vanished. Our true crime panel

441
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,639
is back. Melissa Moore is our crime

442
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,519
correspondent Derek Leasser and Ana

443
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,000
Nicolazi. So, let me ask if you you

444
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,440
brought this case to us and and

445
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,360
highlighted the fact that this may be

446
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,720
the next case we solve with DNA

447
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,040
technology. What are what are folks

448
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,199
thinking? Yeah, there's two stamps on

449
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,440
different envelopes that we have DNA

450
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,160
samples of and it's now being privately

451
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,000
investigated in the lab. So, we are in

452
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,240
an age though where we can take these

453
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,160
sol these these crime cases that have

454
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,560
haunted us for decades and actually

455
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,959
solve them. So Derek, if investigators

456
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,399
actually can get the saliva for DNA off

457
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,600
the stamp or even I guess you had to

458
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
close the envelope, right? Back then you

459
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,279
had to lick it and and we can actually

460
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,880
identify that's from a Zodiac killer.

461
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,120
Are you confident we'll find something?

462
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,839
It's possible. I mean I I can say this

463
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,600
that science and technology in the 1960s

464
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,279
is not what it is today. So if they have

465
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,759
something, they should absolutely retest

466
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,199
it. However, I will say that the

467
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,959
collection and preservation techniques

468
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,800
of evidence back then are not what they

469
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,639
are now. And we do know that based on

470
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,160
how it's preserved, evidence can break

471
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,240
down. However, if they have something

472
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,839
that's viable, it may be our only chance

473
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
at identifying the Zodiac. So, here's

474
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,040
the game plan. Investigators will

475
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,800
hopefully run whatever DNA they get

476
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,800
through genealogy sites in the hopes of

477
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,800
finding a family connection, which is

478
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,000
exactly how the Golden State Killer was

479
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,480
finally caught. We talked about that on

480
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,639
this show. So, using DNA this way is

481
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,199
cutting edge. But, but how would you go

482
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,360
about prosecuting this kind of evidence?

483
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,720
Let's talk to a prosecutor. Ana, what do

484
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,480
you think? DNA is every prosecutor's

485
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,240
friend. However, it's not going to end

486
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,919
there. What they're doing right now is

487
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,839
they are hoping to get enough of a

488
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,679
profile that they can get a match. If we

489
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,760
are so lucky, that is going to get a

490
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,679
prosecutor in the courtroom if they can

491
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,079
show that everything else around it

492
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,839
matches up. Where was this person in the

493
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,520
time? Were they in the vicinity of these

494
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,959
crimes? Can you show that they were out

495
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,079
of the country, out of state? If I'm a

496
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
defense attorney, that's the first thing

497
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,600
I'm going to do. So, there's going to be

498
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,880
a lot of connecting the dots.

499
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,840
Especially, you have a case, as you

500
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,600
pointed out, Dr. odds 50 years have gone

501
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,600
by. You have to talk about the

502
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,360
preservation of evidence that although

503
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,039
people didn't look at preserving it in

504
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,720
the same way that we can still be

505
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,799
confident in the way that this evidence

506
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,160
was maintained that a jury can still

507
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,240
rely on it because that's what it all

508
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,000
comes down to. Proof in not only this

509
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,080
case but in our system comes down to

510
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,520
reliability and that the jury can trust

511
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,200
what we're bringing into that courtroom.

512
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Melissa, is this the last chance to

513
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,840
catch the Zodiac Killer? I believe it

514
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,960
is. Look at how many years have gone by.

515
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,200
witnesses are de deceased now. Memories

516
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,919
are fading and if we can't catch it with

517
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,160
DNA, I don't I don't know unless we have

518
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,720
another a confession. I don't know how

519
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,720
we could process in the future, which is

520
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,720
very often how we get it. The prosecutor

521
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,960
and the optist and me has to remind

522
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,640
everyone that no homicide is ever

523
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,880
closed. There is always a chance down

524
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,880
the road. I've told victims so many

525
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,320
times, their families that because we

526
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,559
don't see anything for a long time,

527
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,720
people do talk. the person out there

528
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,960
misststepped somewhere. We might never

529
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,960
get the answer, but I believe and hope

530
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,679
that someday something pops. DNA would

531
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,400
be a great resolve to this case using

532
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,919
science, but there's never a hopeless

533
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,760
situation. Melissa made a great point,

534
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,280
too. The Golden State Killer is a great

535
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,120
example of good police work and not

536
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,799
giving up hope. We have a guy in custody

537
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,320
now. He's a criminal. He's where he

538
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,160
should be and hopefully we can have the

539
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,360
