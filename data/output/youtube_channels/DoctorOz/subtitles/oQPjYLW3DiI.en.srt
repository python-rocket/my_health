1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,680
Supermarket iced coffee. A quick pickme

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,799
up, but do we really know what's hiding

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,320
in those bottles?

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,840
>> There's two servings there, so you're

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,679
getting 50 gram of sugar.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,480
>> And could the ice in your iced coffee

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,480
make you sick?

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
>> The ice cubes be as dirty as toilet

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
water.

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,560
>> I'm never eating out again.

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,640
>> Plus, the hip hop health revolution. How

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,480
Fat Joe lost the fat.

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
>> Do you feel as good as you look right

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,519
now?

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,519
>> Coming up next.

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,760
It's that time of year when your coffee

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,920
goes from hot, may I? To cold. Enjoy.

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,680
Ready to drink iced coffee is in bottles

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,480
in cans has never been so popular. We

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,079
spend more than $200 million a year on

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,200
these drinks. They're certainly

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,239
convenient. Just head to the

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,760
supermarket, grab and go.

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,440
Enjoy.

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,480
But what's really brewing in your

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,480
storebought iced coffee?

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,160
>> Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah,

28
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,280
[Music]

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,280
>> I love you guys.

30
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,049
[Music]

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,439
Today, the truth about the iced coffee

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,280
at your supermarket. Is there an Oz

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,799
approved iced coffee that you'll want to

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,159
drink? You're all excited about this for

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,080
good reason. Food journalist Mark

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,520
Shasker is here to help us investigate.

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,759
Iced coffee is not a new drink, but

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,600
we're seeing a lot of it in supermarkets

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,159
all over the country. Why so popular?

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,840
Why now?

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,320
>> Well, it seems like for every reason.

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,079
First of all, everyone loves coffee.

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,079
There's caffeine in it. We all need that

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,360
hit of caffeine once a day. Some of us

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,280
five times a day.

46
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,200
>> You know who you are.

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,119
>> Now, a lot of us are looking for an

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,119
alternative to soda, sugar, sweetened

49
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,560
beverages, iced coffee. That for a lot

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,880
of people, we're going to look at that.

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
And finally, there's millennials. They

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,200
love this stuff and they're willing to

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,560
shell out big bucks for the good stuff.

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,079
So now we're seeing I mean it's getting

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,520
bigger and bigger and now iced coffee is

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,439
right there in the supermarket. It is

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,479
super convenient. So coffee has many

58
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,680
health benefits. We've talked about

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,879
them, right? Give you more energy. You

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,120
know that. But it can also lower the

61
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,120
risks of certain diseases. So do these

62
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,120
supermarket drinks give you the same

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,160
benefits? That's the real question. So

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
let's walk through some of the most

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,520
popular kinds out there. The first, of

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,360
course, are the flavored iced coffees

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
that so many folks love. It's not just

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,760
mocha anymore. Oh, he comes in all kinds

69
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,160
of flavors.

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,080
>> There is everything. Chocolate, salted

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,680
caramel, vanilla. Now, you're probably

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
thinking, "But don't you drink iced

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,800
coffee for the flavor of coffee?" Well,

74
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,480
that is a good thought to keep in mind

75
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
cuz if you look at a simple iced coffee,

76
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,360
just cold coffee with a bit of milk.

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
Terms of calories, you're looking at 80

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
to 100. Now, you know those fancy ones

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,000
you get at those fancy coffee shops that

80
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
have like whipped cream and they're in

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,599
the blender, they got caramel chips.

82
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,280
>> 10 times the calories. Up to 10 times.

83
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,280
>> Now, here's the good news. We scoured

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,360
the supermarket shelves. We didn't find

85
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,879
any that were that bad, but we did find

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,120
some where the calorie count starts to

87
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,879
creep up two or 300 calories. So, you're

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
absolutely in the realm of a sugary

89
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,560
drink.

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,159
>> If you ran to this because you don't

91
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,800
want the carbonated sugary drinks you've

92
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,920
been hammering,

93
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
>> you're no better off. You might even be

94
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,599
worse off.

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,440
>> Might be worse off cuz you can't even

96
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,120
tell. All right. Next up, the lattes,

97
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,599
the cappuccinos. Tell us more about

98
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,840
these.

99
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,200
>> So, with hot coffee, if you go to a

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,200
fancy place, the barista, you get a

101
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,360
cappuccino or latte that is made with

102
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,120
steamed milk. The cold version is no

103
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,599
different. It's made with milk. I like

104
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,879
milk, calcium, protein. But when you we

105
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,560
looked at the ingredient list, we found

106
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,120
other things like an emulsifier called

107
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
keragenan. Now kagen. Yes. It it's

108
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239
there. It stops the drink from

109
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,400
separating. It gives it a bit of a

110
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,239
richer mouth feel. There's some concern

111
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,799
that caragen can cause adverse gut

112
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,480
reactions. My take is that when we see

113
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,480
the ingredient list starting to expand,

114
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
starting to get bigger and bigger. We're

115
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,400
getting more into a processed beverage.

116
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,599
We're getting further away from what we

117
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,200
kind of all wanted in the first place,

118
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
which was just cold coffee with a bit of

119
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,239
milk. All right, let's talk about the

120
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,480
trendiest coffee out there. Cold brew.

121
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
This is different. This is not a lot of

122
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,959
stuff. It's actually a very traditional

123
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,319
way of brewing coffee, right? You and

124
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,680
this is actually this is I have a little

125
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,879
picture. This is what it looks like when

126
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,159
people make it at home because it's

127
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,120
pretty popular. But this is unique,

128
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,519
different. How do they put it in the

129
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
can?

130
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,840
>> Cold brew is exactly what it sounds

131
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,680
like. It's you brew coffee with cold

132
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,280
water instead of hot. And when you do

133
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,760
that, you pull out a totally different

134
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
flavor profile. Much less bitter, much

135
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
less acidic. So, a lot of people who

136
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,880
don't like that intense, you know,

137
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
bitterness of coffee, they really love

138
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,840
cold brewed coffee. Another really good

139
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,680
thing is if you're someone who can't

140
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,840
drink coffee black, you might be able to

141
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,960
drink it black cold brewed. So,

142
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,639
>> takes the edge off it.

143
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,720
>> Absolutely. Takes the edge right off it.

144
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,280
>> All right, last category, brand new.

145
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,000
It's called Nitro, and it's been popping

146
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,000
up in coffees recently. I had never

147
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,199
heard of this before, but we're going to

148
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
try it today together.

149
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,639
>> This is wild. This is coffee that's

150
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,880
pressurized with nitrogen. It's like

151
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,600
it's carbonated. Check this out. I mean,

152
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
beer coffee.

153
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,400
>> Listen to that sound it makes. Then you

154
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,040
pour it, you get this nice creamy head

155
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,639
on top.

156
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,400
>> Look at that. You can see the

157
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
carbonation on the side coming up.

158
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,160
>> Now, I want you to taste this cuz it's

159
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,759
got a creamy sweet flavor. A lot of

160
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,160
people would would drink this and they

161
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,759
would swear that it's got milk. It's got

162
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,800
sugar. It's got none of those things.

163
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,039
This is a zerocalorie beverage.

164
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,720
>> It really does taste creamy. It fills

165
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,120
your mouth completely. I It tastes a

166
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,800
little bit like a like an espresso. Put

167
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,320
a little little half and half in it.

168
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,440
>> Exactly. And and if you're trying to get

169
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
away from, you know, you you want

170
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,160
something that's a bit effervescent, got

171
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
a bit of sweetness that, you know,

172
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,639
something more exciting than water, but

173
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,759
you don't want to drink soda, I think

174
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,800
this is a great place to go.

175
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,000
>> So, what are the other health benefits

176
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,320
of this besides the fact you skip the

177
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,919
sugar?

178
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,199
>> Okay. It's less acidic. So, some people

179
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,800
don't like the gut rot that you get with

180
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,560
coffee. This is less acidic. You won't

181
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,560
get that. And there's also some people

182
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
who think that the nitrogen actually

183
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,400
increases the rate of absorption of the

184
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
caffeine. So, you get a bigger caffeine

185
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
pop. So, that's exciting for a lot of

186
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,360
us. That's also a double-edged sword

187
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
because there's such a thing as too much

188
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
caffeine. So, I would say don't drink

189
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
more than two of these in a day.

190
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Otherwise, you might be overdoing in the

191
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,840
caffeine.

192
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,840
>> All right, beginning of the show, I gave

193
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,360
the front row who are all coffee lovers

194
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,039
some of this nitro coffee. So, I wasn't

195
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,039
the only one who tasted it. Show of

196
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,280
hands, who's who who liked it and who's

197
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,160
getting a little buzz from it.

198
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,960
>> What do you think about it?

199
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,479
>> It's really good.

200
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,759
>> Like good. Like I'd drink it again or

201
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,479
I'm just saying that cuz Oz will give me

202
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,520
a hard time otherwise.

203
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
>> Like good. Like I'm about to finish it,

204
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,360
but I didn't want to be rude. Okay.

205
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,199
You know, I'm I don't know if I'm

206
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,759
getting a little bit of a buzz. Are you

207
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,600
feeling this?

208
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,039
>> A little a little bit of a buzz.

209
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,840
>> Yeah. I I I I don't know if you guys are

210
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,360
big coffee drinkers, but I I actually it

211
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,639
smacks me a little faster, which I guess

212
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,479
makes sense, Mark. Right.

213
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,160
>> Yeah. It livens it up on the on the

214
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,240
pallet and it livens it up in the body.

215
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,440
>> All right. So, Barista Sam is here. Hey,

216
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,400
welcome. You've never had a a coffee

217
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,160
from a a bottle or or a can before?

218
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
>> No, no, no. cuz my background is I

219
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,400
manage a micro roaster coffee shop and

220
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,840
so everything I have is freshly brewed

221
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,360
in the morning and even the cold brew is

222
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,000
pulled right out of that 16- hour

223
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
window. So what I drink is as fresh as

224
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
you can get. So when I was tasting the

225
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,680
bottles it was a different experience

226
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,000
because even though it's bottle and it's

227
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,680
fresh and it's not going bad. It does

228
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
lose a little bit of the caffeine and a

229
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,000
little bit of the acidity that some

230
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
people might like in coffees.

231
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,039
>> All right. So we we charged you with

232
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,960
tasting all the ones we just presented

233
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,560
and give us your expert opinion with

234
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,199
your micro what's it? Micro what?

235
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
>> Micro roasting.

236
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,479
>> Micro roasting. I was going to say

237
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
brewery, but I envision the same kind of

238
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,960
thing. Which one did you like the most?

239
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,680
>> Uh the cold brew.

240
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,479
>> The cold brew 100%.

241
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
>> Really remarkable.

242
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,080
>> If I if I didn't have to add in the

243
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
hospital, you're trained to be wary of

244
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,560
coffee because you it's not doesn't

245
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,680
taste very good where we get it from and

246
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,280
you got to put lots of sugar in there

247
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,560
and creams and like this. I would

248
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,599
actually drink. Absolutely. It tastes

249
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,880
like I'm having something that's real.

250
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,680
This like having carrot juice except

251
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,560
it's not.

252
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
>> It's a little better.

253
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,599
>> Little better. I like carrot juice more,

254
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
but we'll call that I like kale juice.

255
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,039
Have you had that?

256
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,479
>> Um m

257
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,000
and out of Spanish. All right, Mark,

258
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,400
give us some advice on health. If you're

259
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,680
looking for coffee in the supermarket,

260
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,240
one of these cold versions, what should

261
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,599
we look for?

262
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,039
>> Well, you know, always look at the

263
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,720
ingredient list. The shorter the better.

264
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,440
First ingredient should be coffee.

265
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,759
>> Absolutely.

266
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,120
>> Think about the sugar. Uh try and avoid

267
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,759
sugar. If you have to have it, maybe try

268
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,680
adding it yourself, but let your palette

269
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,199
expand. If buy one of these, cold brew,

270
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
one of the nitros, you might not like it

271
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
the first time if you're a sugar lover,

272
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,599
but by the third one, your palette will

273
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,560
start to change and you'll go back to

274
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,520
one of those really sweet ones. You go.

275
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
What was I even thinking?

276
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,240
>> Yeah, I bet you a lot of folks will like

277
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,360
the cold brew. The night show's really

278
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,560
hitting me in the head, by the way. I'm

279
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,560
getting a little bit of a brain rush

280
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
now, but it might appeal to you. I'm

281
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,759
fascinated making the things. Up next,

282
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,160
from iced coffee to ice cubes. Let me be

283
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,879
careful about this. Are your ice cubes

284
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,800
as dirty as toilet water?

285
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,160
>> Think about it. Is it possible? We're

286
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,879
going to find out what our germ test

287
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,879

his capture. A college sorority house.

One survivor speaks out.

292
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,320
>> When he attacked me, my jaw was

293
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,640
shattered. My cheek was torn open.

294
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,560

295
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,360

From coffee shops to restaurants, even

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,720
in your own home, many of you use them

305
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,160
in every cold drink. Ice cubes. But just

306
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,000
how dirty are these ice cubes?

307
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,320
Can these ice cubes be as dirty as

308
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,160

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,160
what do you love about ice so much?

320
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,480

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,240
>> Yes.

323
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,320
better than smoking a cigarette. How

324
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
about that?

325
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
>> Well, if I had a choice, I'd chew on the

326
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
ice. That's

327

>> Thank you. Me, too. That's why

328
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,360
>> let's go meet Peter Delucho over here,

329
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,000
our health inspector to help find out

330
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,600
exactly how dirty your ice cubes may be.

331
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
We're not going to panic you yet. So, a

332
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
lot of us think that because the ice is

333
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,560
frozen, it can't possibly harbor

334
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,440
bacteria because bacteria die in the

335
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,880
cold, right?

336
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,320
>> Well, you know, you think that you take

337
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,240
a look at the ice and just because it's

338
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
clear doesn't mean it's clean.

339
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,320
Basically, it's scary. But freezer

340
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
temperatures, they don't kill bacteria.

341
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,480
They don't kill viruses. In fact, with

342
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
bacteria on the most part, it just kind

343
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,519
of slows things down and not

344
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
multiplying, you know, for the most

345
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,120
part. But at the end of the day, once

346
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
that ice winds up in your drink and it

347
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,399
starts melting, if it's contaminated,

348
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,839
it's going to make you sick.

349
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,320
>> So, what kind of bacteria we talking

350
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,760
about here?

351
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,440
>> Uh, well, you know what? It's all types

352
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,959
of bacteria. You think scientists have

353
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
been preserving bacteria by freezing

354
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,399
them, you know, for for months and years

355
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,399
at a time. But what I'm concerned about

356
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,519
are those food born pathogens. I'm

357
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,360
concerned about EC coli, salmonella,

358
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,240
lististeria, and I'm concerned about

359
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,399
viruses like neurovirus and hepatitis A.

360
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,320
The biggest contamination of ice or your

361
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,839
hands and getting that those bacteria in

362
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,600
there. So, what happens is you're

363
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,440
scooping and your hand goes into the

364
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
ice. You're not paying attention. In

365
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,720
commercial ice machines, you're required

366
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,560
to have a scoop. The scoop's supposed to

367
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
be outside the machine. They leave it in

368
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,920
the machine. What happens? It keeps

369
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,680
making more ice. The scoop winds up

370
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,120
being buried. So, next person comes

371
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,800
along. Oh, I need to fill up the ice

372
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,720
bucket to bring upstairs. The hand goes

373
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,160
in here. They discontaminated the ice.

374
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,760
>> All their jaws are dropping. The whole

375
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,920
audience, just like yours,

376
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,200
>> I'm never eating out again.

377
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,880
>> And ice machines are not that easy to

378
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,560
clean. So, it's something that, you

379
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,240
know, needs to be done on a regular

380
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,959
basis. So, one of the things, you know,

381
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,440
a recent study showed that a 100%, think

382
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,000
of it, 100% of ice machines swabbed in

383
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,480
the study at five hospitals and two

384
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,880
nursing homes, all came up positive for

385
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,200
bacteria or funguses.

386
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,320
>> Okay?

387
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
>> So, just so you know, this is not

388
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,240
theoretical. We went one step further. A

389
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,120
study looked at restaurants, places we

390
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,680
all eat.

391
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,079
>> Six out of 10 of them of the restaurants

392
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,640
didn't just have bacteria. They had more

393
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,000
bacteria than the water in the toilets

394
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,600
of those restaurants.

395
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
>> Okay. I really feel like I'm going to

396
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,160
throw up.

397
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,440
>> The good news is we're not getting tons

398
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,959
of foodborne illicites. I don't want

399
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,519
everybody to be scared and never have

400
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,959
ice again. But it's buyer beware. Be

401
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,640
careful. Take a look at situations.

402
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,399
Another concern that I have too, which

403
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,120
we find a lot of times we do inspections

404
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,880
is you'll see bottles in ice. People put

405
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,000
things in to be cool at the bar. Well,

406
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,680
those bottles would touch with your

407
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
hands. That's infected the ice. If you

408
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,160
ever see ice coming from there, you

409
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,560
don't want that.

410
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,959
>> Okay? So, no restaurants and no parties.

411
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,959
No.

412
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,480
>> All right. Said or but here's the

413
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,560
question. Are you safe at home?

414
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,320
>> Since you allowed us into your home, we

415
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,560
actually did a little experiment. We got

416
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,000
some ice and we got some of your toilet

417
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
seat.

418
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,600
>> Just saying.

419
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
>> I am so embarrassed.

420
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,680
>> It is time to

421
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,360
>> No one's going to ever come over.

422
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,079
>> No one's coming to your house. The

423
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,680
results of the germ test. Are you ready?

424
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,440
Now remember, you want a number below

425
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,480
50. Anything above 50 is considered

426
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,639
dirty. Doesn't mean you're going to get

427
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,240
sick. Anything above 50 is not optimal.

428
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,880
Water should be definitely less than 50.

429
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,440
So Mara's freezer germ count was

430
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,519
>> 112.

431
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,120
Now, before we all gasped too loudly,

432
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,320
what was your toilet seat? And it was

433
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,560
>> 143. So, it's sort of close.

434
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,560
>> A little too close, I think. So, here's

435
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,480
the question. How often do you clean the

436
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,440
ice maker in your freezer? And your

437
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,519
answer is

438
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,399
>> uh a couple of times a year.

439
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,839
>> You do? Yeah.

440
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,560
>> If you clean it at all, you're better

441
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,240
than me. Okay.

442
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,440
>> Cuz most of us don't even do that much.

443
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,720
And most of us probably don't even think

444
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,079
about it. But what about the coffee

445
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,519
shops and the restaurants? Are they

446
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,440
cleaning their machine? So, we spoke to

447
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,279
a fast food worker who, well, you'll see

448
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,880
why. He wanted to remain anonymous to

449
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,560
tell us the truth.

450
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,000
>> I worked in the food industry for almost

451
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,839
a year now and um every shift we had,

452
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,440
but people complaining about dirting the

453
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,040
drinks. Um, at least three or four

454
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,880
people a night complained about this.

455
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,360
Um, I believe it came from the ice. Um,

456
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,560
the ice maker was never clean. Um, I

457
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,519
never seen it clean since I've been

458
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,200
there. And also, the buckets that they

459
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,600
use to transport ice was really dirty,

460
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,360
dingy buckets. Um, also hear people

461
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,800
complain more about bugs or whatever in

462
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,639
their drinks as well.

463
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
>> Well, there's a that's a bug. It's a

464
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,440
frozen bug.

465
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,639
>> I mean, it's it's going to happen. I

466
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
mean, we live in a real world. Things

467
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,760
are going to get into our machine. So,

468
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,279
the issue isn't to never contaminate

469
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,399
them, which is ideal, but you got to

470
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,519
clean them. So, how often should we

471
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,240
clean them at home? How often should

472
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,360
restaurants clean them?

473
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,959
>> Well, restaurants are a whole another

474
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,480
story. I mean, there's and different

475
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,079
size ice machines, different cleaning

476
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,519
frequency. The real big ones that that

477
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,959
are like the commercial grade ones that

478
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,000
they're producing a lot of ice, they

479
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,199
break them down. They're supposed to

480
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,240
break them down every couple of months,

481
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,600
but they're supposed to take a look at

482
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,040
them every day because what happens is

483
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,880
you've got lots of parts and all in a

484
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,720
very moist moist area where you're going

485
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,160
to grow typically mold and fungus more

486
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
than anything else. So, you need to wipe

487
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,120
those things down with a sanitizing

488
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,639
solution and keep them clean. But those

489
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
ice bins you see that are up front at

490
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
the restaurants and all, those are going

491
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,959
to be cleaned daily and even sometimes

492
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,800
multipod times during the day. But at

493
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,320
your home, I'm glad glad to hear you

494
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,839
actually clean it because most people

495
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,839
Exactly. they're not cleaning their ice

496
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
machines at home. But if you do it once

497
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,920
a month, that would really be optimum,

498
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,959
especially cleaning this right here. And

499
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,399
they, you know, they come in all

500
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,839
different shapes and sizes, but the ice

501
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,480
basket, that's what you want to make

502
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,480
sure you clean.

503
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,040
>> Okay. I have a question. So, when I

504
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,800
entertain, I have to be in full head to

505
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
toe hosmat, you know.

506
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,800
>> Now, if you if you clean this as

507
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,240
described, it's going to be a low number

508
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,440
because what happens is the bacteria is

509
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,399
growing in place. You don't expect it.

510
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,320
But just in case, take this with you.

511
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,160
>> At least we can do appreciate it. We'll

512
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,199
be right back.

513
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,800
So sweet.

514
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,320
>> What you need to know about the latest

515
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,240
allnatural sweetener for your morning

516
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
coffee or tea. How's it taste?

517
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,600
>> Sweet.

518
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,830
>> Stay. Pay attention. It's coming up.

519
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,120
[Music]

520
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,800
[Applause]

521
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,320
We are back giving you the truth about

522
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,600
the sweetener you're adding to your

523
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,680
morning cup of coffee or tea. Now,

524
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,519
nutritionist Carrie Glasman's gonna go

525
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,040
take us beyond. Yeah, give her a hand.

526
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,560
She knows all about this stuff. go

527
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,279
beyond the pink, the blue, and the white

528
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,600
packets to break down two new allnatural

529
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,120
options that people are talking about.

530
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,639
She's here with Raquel, who is looking

531
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,360
for a new way to sweeten her morning

532
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,120
coffee. The first idea is completely

533
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,440
new. I have never heard about it before.

534
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,360
I've never tasted it. It is sweet potato

535
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,720
nectar. You always bring these breaking

536
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,279
ideas to us. What is this stuff? What

537
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
should we know?

538
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,079
>> So, I think we're going to be seeing a

539
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,920
lot of this this year. So, there's a big

540
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,759
anti-sugar movement going on, right? And

541
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,480
as a dietitian, that makes me very

542
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,120
happy. Manufacturers, however, are

543
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,839
looking for ways to please consumers

544
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,399
desire to still use sweetener. And I

545
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,199
think this is a prime example of that.

546
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,680
Also, it's a great alternative for

547
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,279
vegans instead of honey. So, that's a

548
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,120
great option there. And then from a

549
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,759
sustainability standpoint, it's really

550
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,920
interesting what they they use the ugly

551
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,000
potatoes that would normally be thrown

552
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,240
away and not sold to grocery stores. So

553
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,920
that's good. Good thing too.

554
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,720
>> As I process this, Raquel, your

555
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,480
thoughts.

556
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,440
>> It tastes really good with the coffee.

557
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,800
Like it's not very overwhelming and it's

558
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,920
it's light and it's not as heavy as like

559
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,440
my simple syrup.

560
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,040
>> Raquel, you're absolutely right. It

561
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,959
doesn't smack you. It's not as sweet as

562
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,800
sugar. How does it compare to sugar? How

563
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,160
many calories per tablespoon? All that.

564
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,920
>> Okay, so the calories are going to be

565
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,079
pretty equivalent to honey, which is

566
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,800
slightly higher than sugar. The big

567
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,040
difference is though that this has 6%

568
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,519
fructose whereas honey and sugar is

569
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,319
about 50% and then something like agave

570
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,480
has about 80%. And we know that added

571
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,760
fructose is really the type of sugar we

572
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,039
want to steer clear of as much as

573
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,640
possible because it's metabolized

574
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,799
different in the body and really is

575
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,839
linked to most of the health issues when

576
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,679
we're concerned about sugar.

577
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,959
>> Raquel here and take this and

578
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,799
>> take one of these potatoes too.

579
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,480
>> Thank you. All right, the next

580
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,839
sweetener. The next sweetener we're

581
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,919
going to talk about is something we have

582
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,000
looked at in the past. Monk fruit

583
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,480
sweetener. So, educate us about monk

584
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,880
fruit.

585
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,720
>> So, monk fruit has it comes from the

586
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
monk fruit, of course. It has

587
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,160
>> a very religious fruit.

588
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,799
>> It has z I like that person.

589
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,760
>> It has zero calories, but it's about 200

590
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,960
times sweeter than sugar. It has a very

591
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,400
low glycemic index, but it still may

592
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,320
trigger insulin secretion. So Carrie,

593
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,039
before we get to the taste, tell us how

594
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,799
it's sold.

595
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,039
>> Okay, so you can find it in a granular

596
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,120
form similar to sugar. You can find it

597
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,840
in a liquid form and then you can also

598
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,120
find it in a powder form. So it is a

599
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,280
good option. The only thing I'll say is,

600
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,520
you know, if you don't use any sweetener

601
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,440
at all, don't start adding something in

602
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,720
even if it has zero calories because

603
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,120
then you might just increase your

604
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,200
cravings for sweets in other places.

605
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,640
>> Amy, would this do it for you? I

606
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,400
actually I think it would because I

607
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,240
don't like that fake taste of those

608
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
other artificial sweeteners and I think

609
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,799
this would do it. Zero calories so it's

610
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,160
kind of nice

611
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,360
>> and it's not artificial. The taste is

612
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,600
fabulous. You like the taste I gather,

613
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,240
right?

614
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,919
>> Yeah, I do.

615
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,840
>> Again, it's got plenty of sweetness to

616
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,360
go around and I can't see any reason not

617
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,679
to do it. Toast to you and your good

618
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,559
ideas.

619
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,160
>> Oh, thank you.

620
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,280
>> As you go back to Becky, as you go to

621
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,880
break, I got a new idea for you to

622
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,280
sweeten up your green tea. You can make

623
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,039
it into a smoothie. Sweetened the

624
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,039
natural way with fruit and honey. Take a

625
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,039
look.

626
00:18:43,640 --> 00:19:07,349
[Music]

627
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Today on the show, we're doing a hip-hop

628
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,880
takeover. We're talking about a hip-hop

629
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,880
health summit with the stars of the

630
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,280
biggest music genre addressing the

631
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,440
industry shift to a healthier lifestyle.

632
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,919
>> Tune in to find out why we are trading

633
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,120
champagne bottles for vegan juice.

634
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,120
>> You won't want to miss this.

635
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:35,520
[Applause]

636
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,760
>> Sometimes the fame and fortune of the

637
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,400
music industry means living large in

638
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,400
more ways than one. Today, an important

639
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,480

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,799
biggest names in hip-hop coming forward

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,039
about a new rapper revolution. A move

642
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,280
away from excess towards healthy eating

643
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,160
and living. One of the best known

644
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,600
rappers of all time, Fat Joe is here

645
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,919
today to reveal how he wants the fat.

646
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,520
Changing his body and his mindset.

647
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,240
Reporting from the front lines of the

648
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,120

but this hip hop health summit is going

653
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,200
to start with a man, a larger than life

654
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,679
persona who's recently dropped 100

655
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,600
pounds. Please welcome fivetime Grammy

656
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,600
nominated hiphop artist Fat Joe.

657
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:38,080
[Applause]

658
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,720
Oh my goodness.

659
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,280
God bless you for being here. Oh, I'm so

660
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,520
proud to have you. You look amazing,

661
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,520
don't they?

662
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,919
>> And they're they're proud of you.

663
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,640
>> Now, Dr. Oz, it's a it's an honor to be

664
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,360
here with Dr. Oz. Uh, I've always I've

665
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,760
always watched your show with my wife,

666
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,400
with my family, and we love the work you

667
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,080
do and and bringing the the health me

668
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,320
message out there to the community. So,

669
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,080
I really want y'all to know I'm honored

670
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,440
to be here with Dr. Oz. This is a big

671
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,840
deal for you. God bless you. Thank you.

672
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,640
Well, there's so much to talk about. I

673
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,200
mean, I first saw you actually in action

674
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,520
helping kids learn about their bodies.

675
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,120
And what's so important about hip-hop

676
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,919
getting engaged in this is you guys tell

677
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,480
the truth.

678
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,919
>> That's the essence of the genre. So when

679
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
you tell kids the truth about their

680
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,960
lives, they listen to you.

681
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,640
>> But I'm going to start with you. I see

682
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,559
you walk out here. You got a swagger to

683
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,799
you. You got to look. Do you do you do

684
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,520
you do you feel as good as you look

685
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,600
right now?

686
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,480
>> Yeah, I feel as good as I look. And uh

687
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,080
I'm trying to feel even better, Dr. Oz.

688
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,120
And you got to keep it real with

689
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,559
yourself.

690
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,559
>> Yeah. Let's go back a second. Your

691
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,240
weight was part of your persona, right?

692
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,919
You named yourself Fat Joe.

693
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,919
>> Well, you know, I was always Fat Joey

694
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,640
from Forest Projects in the Bronx, you

695
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,679
know? So,

696
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,240
I don't think

697
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,440
>> I don't think a skinny Joe ever existed,

698
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,760
man.

699
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,320
>> But you tipped the scale of 460 lbs at

700
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,120
your heaviest.

701
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
>> Even more, Doc.

702
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,000
>> Even more.

703
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,120
>> We would go, Me and Big Pun, rest in

704
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,120
peace, you know, you go to Sizzlers and

705
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,200
you know, you put your plate on top of

706
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,120
the tray. We would take the plate off

707
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,200
and fill up the whole tray.

708
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,960
>> So, a lot of guys that come from where I

709
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,640
come from, you make money, you start

710
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,640
thinking you want to eat lobsters and

711
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,480
drinking bottles of champagne and you

712
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,640
want to do you're doing it big. But the

713
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,240
truth is you're doing more damage to

714
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,679
yourself. But take me back to that

715
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,600
point. Your first solo album comes out,

716
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,080
Represent. You go from being well known

717
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,600
in the South Bronx to becoming worldwide

718
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,520
in your appeal

719
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,760
>> and you have access to everything. So,

720
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,000
what are the pitfalls there? What? What?

721
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
What?

722
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,760
>> There's too much pitfalls. There's too

723
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,440
much pitfalls from then to now. Dr. O.

724
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,880
Like, everybody always seems to want to

725
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,679
eat, to meet, to talk, to do. It's like

726
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,080
I'm addicted to food. So, if I'm riding

727
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,400
in the highway and I see a McDonald's

728
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,720
signs, it's like McDonald's fries is

729
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,840
chasing me. They break dancing by me.

730
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,640
They doing salsa. Nah.

731
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,480
And And we got to And we got to try our

732
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,960
best to stay away from that. So in my

733
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,960
house, we don't have none of those

734
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,200
temptations. You know, my wife, she's

735
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,200
very health consscious, so we don't even

736
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,679
bring it in the house. So let me talk

737
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,600
about this wakeup call you had 2000. Joe

738
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,799
was scheduled to perform on SNL Saturday

739
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,039
Night Live with two of his closest

740
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,880
friends, Jennifer Lopez and Big Pun, who

741
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,120
you just mentioned a few seconds ago.

742
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,600
Big Pun canled at the last minute. Two

743
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,320
days later, you received the devastating

744
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,400
news. He had passed.

745
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,760
>> We were young, right? So when you young,

746
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,360
you think you're invincible. And so we

747
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,320
got to teach the youth from now.

748
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,640
>> Well, how did it affect you when this

749
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,640
big punk was 28 years old, weighed 700

750
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,480
lb, has a heart attack, respiratory

751
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,120
failure, leaves three kids behind, and a

752
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,320
wife?

753
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,840
>> I went on uh what I call a crackhead

754
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,520
diet where I ain't eat nothing for like

755
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,640
a whole year and I started working out

756
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,279
at the YMCA. So I lost about 100 pounds.

757
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,520
So what's been the key to the what's on

758
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,240
your road to success? What are the the

759
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,559
obvious?

760
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
>> Education is key, Dr. Oz. That's why we

761
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,159
love you so much and we appreciate what

762
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,960
you do.

763
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:30,080
So education is key. So a lot of people

764
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,960
a lot of people so diabetes is like the

765
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,840
VIP, the express lane to death,

766
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,440
>> right?

767
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,279
>> And people don't realize some people

768
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,440
say, "Yo, I don't have a sweet tooth. I

769
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,520
don't have I don't eat all this junk

770
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,919
food." But when you when you go to a

771
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,159
Spanish restaurant, they put bread with

772
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,320
butter on the table. Once you eat that

773
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,799
bread, it turns into sugar in the body.

774
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,360
>> You know,

775
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,799
>> then you eat the rice, beans, and god

776
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,840
forbid you eat fried chicken or

777
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,240
something like that. But let's just say

778
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,240
the rice and beans and platinos.

779
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,159
>> That's all sugar in your body.

780
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,080
>> Then when you turn around and you eat a

781
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,919
dessert or something like that, god

782
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,400
forbid you drink two sodas, you're done.

783
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,480
You're you're recipe for death. So we

784
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,320
got to stay away from the carbs. What I

785
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,520
mean by carbs, I mean rice, bread,

786
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,000
spaghetti, potatoes, all of that we got

787
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,640
to do away with. So, we got to eat meats

788
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,400
if you into eating meats, fish, chicken,

789
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,600
but you got to you got to lace it with

790
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,679
greens. That's the only way you're going

791
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,880
to live. The carbs are the killer. Doc,

792
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,120
>> you want to co-host the show from now

793
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,240
on?

794
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,600
>> No, I mean, I would love to.

795
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,240
>> I'm in. I'm in. I tell you, you got it.

796
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,039
>> All right. So, we got a mutual friend,

797
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,640
Eug

798
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,120
I gather he and others are looking at

799
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,240
you and saying, "If Fat Joe can do it,

800
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,840
we can do it."

801
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,720
>> Khaled is my little brother. I

802
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,919
discovered him and he uh one day he

803
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,919
called me up and he said, "What's the

804
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,200
gimmick? What's the secret?" And I said,

805
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,679
"What you mean, what's the gimmick?"

806
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,240
"Nah, you got a secret. Your your your

807
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,240
neck is skinny." So, I'm like, "Yeah."

808
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,559
So, I said, he's possessed with this

809
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,799
neck skinny thing, right? So I said,

810
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,400
"Kallet, man, there's no other gimmick.

811
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,640
We got to stay off the carbs. We got to

812
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,960
work out." So he had Weight Watchers

813
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,120
help him with the diet. I I put some uh

814
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,880
workout routines with him and I kept

815
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,880
calling him every day, facetiming them

816
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,200
every day. And now he lost close to 50

817
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,400
lbs. So that's what I did to calendar.

818
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,080
>> Before we go to break, one question

819
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,039
about someone else you care a lot about.

820
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,240
>> JLo.

821
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,080
>> Well, I love JLo. She's she's a machine.

822
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,120
>> She is a machine. Uh, she's probably

823
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,440
going to go down as the best looking

824
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,080
older woman ever. Like, ever.

825
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,880
>> She might.

826
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,880
>> There she is. There's Hy Barry. There's

827
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,559
a couple of them. Haley, Bailey, and and

828
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,039
a couple of them. But I think JLo's

829
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,320
going to win.

830
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,039
>> So, are you going to the wedding with

831
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,880
A-Rod?

832
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,640
>> I would love if she invites me, I'm

833
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
going 1 million%. I think it's a

834
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,080
beautiful couple. Her and A.

835
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,480
>> He's handsome. She's beautiful. They're

836
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,320
good.

837
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,919
>> They're handsome. All right. When we

838
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,120
come back, Lisa Evers is here with some

839
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,120
of the the biggest stuff you want to

840
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,919
hear about. Music's heaviest hitters are

841
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:04,600
trained in champagne for vegan juice,

842
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,600
sparking a hip-hop health revolution.

843
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,050
[Applause]

844
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,960
I love getting to talk with you on my

845
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,120
show every single day, but when the

846
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,440
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

847
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,520
is not over. I still have a lot that I

848
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,320
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

849

[Applause]

852
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,640
For years, it seemed like the hip-hop

853
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,240
community has kept quiet while its

854
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,200
biggest stars battled health problems

855
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,200
due to lies of excess until now. Today,

856
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,360
a hip-hop health summit with the stars

857
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,799

858
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,320
big shift in the industry towards a

859
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,080
healthier lifestyle. I'm here with a

860
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,600
woman who's been on the front lines

861
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,360
telling hip-hop story from the very

862
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,279
beginning. Fox 5 reporter right here in

863
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,679
New York City, Emmy nominated host of

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,320
Street Soldiers, Lisa Evers. Fat Joe we

865
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,880
just spoke to. He's lost 100 pounds

866
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,039
recently. He lost 100 before that. And

867
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,399
two members of the iconic The Locks

868
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,919
rappers Styles P and Jana Kiss who are

869
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,640
bringing health back to their old

870
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,159
neighborhood one green juice at a time.

871
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,520
Take it away. I want I want you to talk

872
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,279
to folks that you brought to our stage

873
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,799
today because they're each of you iconic

874
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,240
in your own way and I'm very proud that

875
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,039
you're here talking about something that

876
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,200
matters.

877
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,200
>> No, definitely. Well, Styles and JD Kiss

878
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,640
with the juices, the community, their

879
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,840
whole thing. They've been involved. All

880
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,080
three of these gentlemen have been

881
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,080
involved in the community from the very,

882
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,000
very beginning. No matter how famous

883
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,240
they become, no matter the world tours,

884
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
the awards, the Grammy nominations, all

885
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,240
of that. And for you guys, this whole

886
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
mission of food, especially coming from

887
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,919
the urban centers where you get

888
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,240
fluorescent colored soda or something

889
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,159
fried, that's pretty much it. It's more

890
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,600
of a mission to you. It's not just about

891
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,960
a health craze. Tell us about that.

892
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,799
>> It's very much a mission. I mean, fast

893
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,080
food has been around since the late

894
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,600
1800s, early 1900s, which means in most

895
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,919
neighborhoods, you you're acquired to

896
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,159
living fast and just picking up the the

897
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,679
meals. So, every every poor

898
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,840
neighborhood, urban neighborhood, just

899
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,080
every neighborhood in the country period

900
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,520
should have healthy options like and it

901
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,399
should be known what the healthy options

902
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,720
are.

903
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,799
>> And Chris, what

904
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,399
Chris, what about the influence of

905
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,640
social media, too? because people see

906
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,559
the artist, they see you guys every day,

907
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,919
they see every aspect of your life, they

908
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,679
make all kinds of comments. Is that

909
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,799
playing a role kind of pushing people in

910
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,960
a positive direction?

911
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,440
>> Social media definitely plays a role.

912
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,679
It's definitely a big platform. Um, you

913
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,520
know, a lot of times the kids or the

914
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,760
people, your followers, fans, they

915
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,679
usually go off what they see. So, if you

916
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,159
you in the juice bar, you in your own

917
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,159
crib cutting up some bananas or, you

918
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,000
know, just living a healthy lifestyle,

919
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,000
it usually follows. And you know what I

920
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,240
mean? It'll go a long way. They watch

921
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,200
your pages like more than they watch you

922
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,960
in real life.

923
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
>> It'll be so easy for you guys with the

924
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,960
fame and fortune you found just move on

925
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,120
and leave it all behind. That's actually

926
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,159
why I'm so honored you're here

927
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,640
>> because you could have moved on in life.

928
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,080
>> I think

929
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,760
>> that's not what that's not what it's

930
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,760
about. It's always about whether it's

931
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,840
health, whether it's any any type of

932
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,440
issue in our community. We we love our

933
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,159
community. So everybody talks about

934
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,080
getting rich and moving out the hood. we

935
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,679
actually come back and embrace and open

936
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,320
businesses in our hood and show them how

937
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,080
to live a healthy healthy lifestyle. You

938
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,600
know, it's all about our people, bro.

939
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,760
>> And Dr. Oz, I think also the core of

940
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,760
hiphop is about authenticity. So, it's

941
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,279
also about caring about yourself, caring

942
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,760
about your loved ones, too, because

943
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,000
we've seen too many big stars pass away

944
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,919
in their 40s from weight related

945
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,919
problems like diabetes, like heart

946
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,760
issues. And I think when you see stars

947
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,360
of this level and this magnitude,

948
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,000
they're among the others like we see

949
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,679
like Common Erica Badu, we've seen she's

950
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
on the R&B side, but we've seen so many

951
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,679
other artists who've shed the weight and

952
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,360
are ador, you know, adopting these

953
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,520
healthy lifestyles and they're making it

954
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,880
a trend. They're also making healthy

955
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,640
eating, a healthy lifestyle,

956
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,559
>> like a lifestyle. It's more than a trend

957
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,240
because trends come and go. Like you

958
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,039
say, this right here is permanent. It's

959
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,279
not temporary. This is to you go.

960
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,120
>> Definitely. Styles and Jada wanted to

961
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,600
share this with all of you guys in the

962
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,640
audience. So, backstage, I heard you got

Oz. So, we know you're a kale fan.

971
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,880

>> So, we have kale, spinach, bananas,

973
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,159
green apple. Oh my goodness.

978
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,200
>> and to you Dr.

979
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,799
>> Thanks for bringing this story to us.

980
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,880
You guys are wonderful. Best of wishes

981
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,320
to you. We'll be right back. Last more

982
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,440
to do.

983
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,440
[Music]

984
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,320
>> Ted Bundy. His last brutal attack before

985
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,559
his capture. One survivor speaks out.

986
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,880
>> When he attacked me, my jaw was

987
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,320
shattered. My cheek was torn open.

988
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,760
>> Plus, buyer beware. When murder houses

989
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,640
go up for sale, all new oz.

990
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,310
>> That's coming up tomorrow.

991
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:13,200
[Applause]

992
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:15,440
[Music]

993
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,039
Today, the number one thing I never

994
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,240
leave home without, and you shouldn't

995
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,120
either. I'm talking about aspirin. Now,

996
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,039
every year nearly 800,000 Americans will

997
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,960
suffer from a heart attack. Right? It's

998
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,799
a common problem. And listen carefully.

999
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,480
Nearly 800,000 more will have a stroke.

1000
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,799
>> But you may be able to save your own

1001
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,360
life and the lives of those you love.

1002
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,519
Here to tell us more is cardiologist Dr.

1003
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,640
Paul Gerbal, who's here on behalf of my

1004
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,559
trusted sponsor partner there. Dr. Why

1005
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,960
is it that we have so much control over

1006
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,480
our future? And how can aspirin, chewing

1007
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,600
it in particular, save our lives if

1008
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,960
we're having a heart attack?

1009
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,440
>> Well, it's important to note that when

1010
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,440
you chew the aspirin, it speeds up its

1011
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,840
ability to get into your circulation.

1012
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,679
And that's where aspirin works. It works

1013
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,679
by blocking platelets from sticking

1014
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,440
together. And it's that sticking

1015
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,679
together of the platelets that occurs in

1016
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,760
the artery and your heart. So, by

1017
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,679
chewing the aspirin, you speed the

1018
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,480
delivery of the aspirin to the clot and

1019
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,399
you allow the blood flow to continue.

1020
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,240
And it's important to note that in the

1021
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,799
setting of a heart attack, you call 911,

1022
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,039
you chew the aspirin, crush it, and

1023
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,960
swallow it. Now, I know you don't like

1024
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,000
the taste of the aspirin. I get that.

1025
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,200
But it's really important to remember

1026
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,880
this lesson. Let me show you what

1027
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,480
happens to your body when you do take an

1028
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,320
aspirin. So, let's go inside the heart

1029
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,159
first. Dr. Gripple spoke about this, but

1030
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,240
this vessel in the middle of the heart

1031
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,360
sends blood into the heart so it can

1032
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,720
keep beating. This vessel right here.

1033
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,880
Let's go inside of that vessel and see

1034
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,240
what happens. The blood vessel has

1035
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,600
little red cells that are courarssing

1036
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,960
through it. But this plaque, this white

1037
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,640
plaque, can grow larger. Now, watch

1038
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,000
carefully. Right here, there's a little

1039
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,000
irritated area and a plaque and it

1040
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
ruptures. Now, your body has an open

1041
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
sore in there and platelets which are

1042
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,360
sticky form a little clot to heal you.

1043
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,679
But unfortunately, they close off the

1044
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,279
artery blocking it and boom, it's like

1045
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,679
someone punched the front of your heart.

1046
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,640
It causes a heart attack. But if you

1047
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,960
take an aspirin, right, which again, you

1048
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,200
should ideally chew it when you start to

1049
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,599
feel that pain. Pop that aspirin in

1050
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,359
there, right? And as you chew it, it's

1051
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,879
immediately gets into your bloodstream,

1052
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,919
right? And it can affect that artery

1053
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,200
that I just showed you. It's go back to

1054
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,639
that same artery. Now you have those

1055
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,720
same red cells running through there

1056
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,639
bringing nutrition, oxygen to your body,

1057
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,839
to your arteries, and to your heart. But

1058
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,520
that plaque when it gets big and it

1059
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,040
ruptures, watch what happens. You have a

1060
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,119
plate that stick a little bit, but you

1061
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,480
don't form this big scab. Blood can

1062
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,119
still get around it. A little bit of

1063
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,520
blood can escape. That gives us time.

1064
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,280
that makes it possible for us to get in

1065
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,679
there and push this open with a stent or

1066
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,879
do bypass surgery or melt this clot

1067
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,879
away. We can do lots of things to save

1068
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,879
you. Just give us the time to help you.

1069
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,040
Dr. Gerbo, you say that aspirin and

1070
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,639
having a good regimen for it is crucial

1071
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,320
if you've already experienced some type

1072
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,000
of a cardiovascular event.

1073
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,000
>> Well, that's because patients who've had

1074
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,240
a cardiovascular event have proven that

1075
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,960
they can already form a clot, a serious

1076
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,720
clot in the heart or in the brain. And

1077
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,040
it's in these patients where aspirin is

1078
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,520
particularly important. And in fact,

1079
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,839
administration of aspirin under the

1080
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,680
direction of a doctor can reduce the

1081
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,040
second occurrence of a heart attack by

1082
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,119
31%.

1083
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,520
>> And a a a clot related stroke by 22%.

1084
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,599
But of course, all patients need to talk

1085
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,640
to their doctor first before starting an

1086
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,079
aspirin, stopping an aspirin regimen, or

1087
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,240
changing an aspirin regimen.

1088
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,920
>> Give us the numbers one more time. 31%

1089
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,079
reduction of having another heart attack

1090
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,720
if you've had one. 31%

1091
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,920
>> 31%

1092
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,880
>> and 22% reduction in the occurrence of a

1093
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,280
second stroke.

1094
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,359
>> These are massive numbers, big numbers

1095
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,359
and no one knows them better than Tony

1096
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,200
because she's been taking Bayer aspirin

1097
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,560
ever since she had an eskeemic stroke.

1098
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,280
Thank you for being here very much.

1099
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,480
>> Thank you so much.

1100
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,240
>> So you had this, if I understand

1101
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,280
correctly, this eskeemic stroke

1102
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,920
>> two years ago.

1103
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,599
>> Yes.

1104
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,400
>> You look good. You feeling okay?

1105
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,079
>> Yeah, I feel great.

1106
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,760
>> All right. So So thankfully you're able

1107
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,040
to recover. So you had to get advice. So

1108
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,160
what went through your mind after you

1109
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,640
had this stroke? You're still a young

1110
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,599
woman.

1111
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,200
>> Yes. Um I was terrified. I was so

1112
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:08,320
scared. I couldn't believe this actually

1113
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,640
happened to me. Um I didn't know what my

1114
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,119
future was going to hold, but I knew

1115
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,760
that I needed to make some changes in my

1116
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:19,040
lifestyle to um commit to stop smoking.

1117
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,960
>> Good for you. Did you do it?

1118
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,320
>> Yes, I did. Clean.

1119
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,079
>> I like that, Tony. And also I started an

1120
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,359
exercise routine

1121
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,000
>> running marathons.

1122
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,839
>> Oh no,

1123
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,320
>> no, but something

1124
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,000
>> no

1125
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,119
>> that makes us sweat once in a while.

1126
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,440
>> Exactly. Yes.

1127
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,040
>> So she told me that taking taking bare

1128
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,119
aspirin is a key component in helping

1129
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,160
prevent a second cardiovascular event in

1130
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,560
your case.

1131
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,560
>> Yes.

1132
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,680
>> How does that fit into your regime?

1133
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,160
>> Um my doctor uh put me on aspirin after

1134
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,359
my stroke and I've continued to take

1135
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,320
that every day since faithfully. It's on

1136
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,200
my nightstand.

1137
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,480
>> Good for you.

1138
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,520
>> And um yeah, I have so much to live for,

1139
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,480
so much to be thankful for. My wonderful

1140
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,760
husband who has been so amazing and

1141
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,040
supportive through my recovery. He's

1142
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:13,280
just an amazing man. And um so it's

1143
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:16,720
important to me that I make every

1144
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,280
change possible so that I can live a

1145
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,040
long and healthy life. You know, I'm

1146
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,920
proud of you for taking charge.

1147
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,680
>> Thank you.

1148
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,119
>> You had a warning sign. Thankfully, you

1149
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,320
recovered from it. Not everyone so lucky

1150
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,160
as you. But when you have a second

1151
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,440
chance, don't give it up. And for most

1152
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,720
folks, they prevent the first problem

1153
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,960
from ever happening. That's even better.

1154
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,920
So, Dr. Gerbal, who should be taking a

1155
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,599
daily aspirin?

1156
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,760
>> Well, you know, the the decision about

1157
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,200
taking a daily aspirin is best a

1158
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,680
decision made between the treating

1159
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,280
doctor and the and the patient. You know

1160
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,160
there are many reasons patients take

1161
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,079
aspirin for pain control for control of

1162
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,079
fever for arthritic pain but it's

1163
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,720
important to note that aspirin is an

1164
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,920
important cardiovascular medicine and it

1165
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,680
can save save lives. So the doctor needs

1166
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,359
to take into account the total health of

1167
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,280
the patient. It's a personalized

1168
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,920
decision that needs to be made and in

1169
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,000
that setting many patients can derive a

1170
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,560
benefit from personalized treatment with

1171
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
aspirin.

1172
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,599
>> Yeah. Remember the word doctor comes

1173
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,280
from the Latin for teacher. That's what

1174
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,880
we're supposed to be as teachers. So you

1175
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,000
were a good student. You came to class

1176
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,240
prepared. I'm proud of you for doing

1177
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,200
that.

1178
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,680
>> Thank you.

1179
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,760
>> Thanks to my partner Bear. You're all

1180
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,000
going home. Everyone here with a Bear

1181
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,440
aspirin pill tote to keep in your wallet

1182
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,599
or your purse. And that's not all.

1183
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:33,480
You're also getting a $100 gift card to

1184
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,480
CVS. Enjoy it. We'll be right back.

1185
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Ow.

1186
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,260
[Music]

1187
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,499
[Music]

1188
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,760
I love those. If you're a cat owner,

1189
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,359
then you know your cat could get into

1190
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,280
anything. Just like those cats we shot.

1191
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,520
This is my family cat. We call him baby

1192
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,960
cat. Actually, Daffhne originally got

1193
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,960
him, but we've adopted him into our

1194
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,880
family. So, when we read that an uber

1195
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,880
popular household item can be especially

1196
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,880
dangerous to cats, well, I wanted to

1197
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,040
find out more. Dr. Heather Lenser,

1198
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,880
senior veterary officer with the

1199
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,400
American Animal Hospital Association, is

1200
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,240
here with a warning. So, what is this

1201
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,200
potential new danger that cat owners

1202
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,680
should be worried about?

1203
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,320
>> It's actually essential oils. Just like

1204
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,200
oil and water, cats and essential oils

1205
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,200
don't mix. And the reason is their liver

1206
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,119
is lacking very specific enzymes that

1207
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,839
help metabolize and break down certain

1208
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,400
drugs. Dogs and people have this enzyme,

1209
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,640
but cats don't. So they're sitting by a

1210
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,200
diffuser like this. They get the oil

1211
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,240
onto their fur and they ingest it

1212
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,680
because you know how they like to keep

1213
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,320
themselves clean

1214
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,880
>> fidiously. There they are. Look

1215
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,440
>> licking.

1216
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,240
>> Exactly.

1217
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,480
>> Pawing.

1218
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,240
>> So you So they or they can inhale it as

1219
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,760
well. And so some people actually

1220
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,280
accidentally thinking they're doing the

1221
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,920
right thing will try to prevent things

1222
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,920
like fleas by putting essential oils on

1223
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,240
their cats. So not only is it not

1224
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,480
effective, it actually can be toxic as

1225
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
well.

1226
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,599
>> So what do you do if your pet is exposed

1227
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,200
to some of these essential oils?

1228
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,680
>> Well, if especially if they show start

1229
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,839
showing signs like vomiting, diarrhea,

1230
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,240
difficulty breathing, like if a cat ever

1231
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,160
is panting, they need to go to the vet.

1232
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,680
That's an emergency. And you want to

1233
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,280
make sure that in an emergency, the

1234
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,680
hospital's accredited by the American

1235
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,440
Animal Hospital Association so they can

1236
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,760
take as the great care of your animal.

1237
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,520
>> But if my pet my pets baby cat's not

1238
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,720
panting, but they got the aroma, can I

1239
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,079
shampoo it off? How do I clean?

1240
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,240
>> You get the solution to pollution is

1241
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,000
dilution. So you can actually just uh

1242
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,000
give them a quick bath with a degreasing

1243
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,200
shampoo. Even something like dishwashing

1244
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,520
detergent is fine.

1245
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,640
>> And options if you like the smell as my

1246
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,640
wife does very much, but you don't have

1247
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,000
essential oils, you have a a fail safe

1248
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,640
backup. Uh something soy based would be

1249
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,920
a great idea. You just keep it away from

1250
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,319
your cat and you know how curious they

1251

can be.

1252
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,960
>> Yes. But this would end up in the ground

1253
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,880
for us. But but this is what we actually

1254
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,200
do right now to keep our cats safe.

1255
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,920
>> Excellent.

1256
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,880
>> Thank you very much.

1257
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,160
>> Thank you. Have a great day.

1258
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,280
>> Together. Change is happening my

1259
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,280
friends. Our journey is just beginning.
