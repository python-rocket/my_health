00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,000
You're my best friend. My best friend.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,240
Dr. Oz's best

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,800
[Music]

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:13,759
friend. My morning routine

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,759
is very quick. Water, lemon

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,039
juice, off to

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,039
work there.

8
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,039
Okay.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,199
Water. You could act to kill the tub,

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,199
but it's a little early.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,389
[Music]

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
When we posted this little video of my

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,760
morning routine, which was filmed by Dr.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,360
Royen, so many of you had tons of

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,559
questions about lemon and water. It

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,920
happens to be one of my family's

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,120
favorite eating hacks. That was me

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
before work, so you can see it was still

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,920
dark outside. So, today, everything you

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,600
want to know about lemon water. And if

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,360
you've been bored by your diet or not

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
seeing the results that you want, we are

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,760
revealing the Oz family's hacks that

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
will get you out of a rut. Please

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,680
welcome my beautiful wife and editor at

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:09,400
large of the Good Life Bookazine, Lisa

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:12,159
[Applause]

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,760
Oz. So, this is the one like most moms

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,080
has got to get the kids out of a rut. We

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,560
all get into them once in a while. When

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
you see something happening, how do you

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,680
know it's a person in a rut? What are

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,280
the symptoms? Well, with food, the way

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
you know that you're in a rut, there are

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,479
a couple things. The first is pay

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,080
attention to your body. How do you feel?

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,520
Is the food you're eating making you

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,200
feel sluggish or moody or bloated? If

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,759
you're feeling bad, you're going to need

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,680
to change things up. Secondly, it's is

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,799
it boring? Cuz if you're not enjoying

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,320
what you're going to eat, what you're

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,920
eating and you're not having fun and

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,520
it's not delicious, then you're going to

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
cheat and eat something else. So, if

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,640
you're either of those are off, you know

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,799
it's time to change. And the great thing

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,680
about these hacks is they are super

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
simple and you get if you do them and

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560
you stick with them and they're just

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,079
tiny little adjustments, it makes it

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
much easier easier to change other

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,799
stuff. All right, so we're going to

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
start off with the big eating hack to

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
get you out of a rut which is using

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
lemon in water, right? It's a great way

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
to boost your immunity. It takes her

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,399
seconds to do. Lisa posted this video of

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,599
my morning ritual, right? Thousands of

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,440
people responded with questions.

61
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,920
Everyone wanted to know why we start our

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,280
days drinking lemon water. And this is

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,640
one of those little rut changes Lisa

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
mentioned because most of us have coffee

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,760
first thing in the morning, right? I

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,920
want you just to try this. Just take a

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
couple days, put the coffee down. You

68
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,800
can have it an hour or two after you

69
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,720
wake. But the first thing you should do

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,360
in the morning is a little bit of water

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,640
with lemon. Why this timing? Well, first

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,400
thing in the morning, but lemon water is

73
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
great for you. If you you sleep all

74
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,920
night, eight hours, you probably get six

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,360
and a half to eight. You're dehydrated.

76
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,440
You haven't had anything to drink for

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
that amount of time. So, you need to

78
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,959
drink water when you first wake up. You

79
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,879
put lemon water in it and it boosts it.

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,040
So, as you said, it improves your

81
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,360
immunity. That's from the vitamin C, but

82
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,599
it also has a lot of minerals in it,

83
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,200
which makes it surprisingly alkal

84
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,920
alkalinizing um instead of acidifying

85
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,440
even though it is an acid and um it

86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,879
tastes delicious. So, you'll be more

87
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,920
likely to drink it and it's um so good

88
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,400
for you. So, who here has tried lemon

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,159
juice in the morning with water? Couple

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
people, right? Spattering a polite a

91
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,920
polite spattering of applause. So here's

92
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,959
the deal, right? And because it most

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,480
people think I'm not going to like it,

94
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,239
I'm not going to like it. If you try it,

95
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,280
you'll find it's relatively mild, right?

96
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,440
Now, here's another question that comes

97
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,200
from Instagram all the time when is

98
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,959
which is will the acid in the lemon

99
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,560
bother my stomach? A very rational

100
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,640
question. Let me explain something

101
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,280
that's pretty profound. This lemon,

102
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,239
right, has an acidity that is no greater

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,840
than your stomach's. So, when you put a

104
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,280
little bit of lemon juice in water,

105
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,280
you're diluting it, which means your

106
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,319
stomach acidity is at least a hundred

107
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
times more than this lemon juice with a

108
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,560
little water that we're talking about.

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,920
Often a thousand or 10,000 times more

110
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,760
acidic than the lemon juice I'm

111
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,200
recommending. But it is more acidic than

112
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,400
your mouth. So, after you drink this,

113
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,840
you should probably rinse with plain

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
water. Yeah. You don't want it sitting

115
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
on your teeth. This is an excuse to

116
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,680
drink more water. Once you start with

117
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,920
this, it gets you going. And don't drink

118
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,040
the seeds. They're not good for you. I

119
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,439
didn't know that. Yeah, you're drinking

120
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,040
the seeds. Now you're telling me after

121
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,360
33 years of marriage now I learn

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,799
Instagram you didn't notice. So acidic

123
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,239
foods what do they do? First of all they

124
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,519
keep the blood sugar more stable. So if

125
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,479
you have some carbs around it doesn't

126
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,079
hurt you so much. Some say it helps with

127
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,079
constipation. Could it really? I want to

128
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,919
see how things move. It helps me. Does

129
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,120
it help you? I've never had that

130
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,400
problem. Oh. So no personal experience

131
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
but I wanted to see if it would work for

132
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
all of you. So we did an experiment. We

133
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
had three women and let's see. You guys

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
were all backed up, right? This is

135
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,120
Marlene, Sarah, and Rose. I don't want

136
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,400
to put words in your mouth, but let's

137
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,479
just assume I'm right and saying you

138
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
were backed up. I want to know the

139
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,360
verdict. Did the lemon juice in the

140
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,440
morning help you? Are you ready? Not

141
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,639
really. Sarah. Sarah's happy. Oh, look

142
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,639
at that smile. Look at that smile. I'll

143
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,000
take one out of three. I will take one

144
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,759
out of three. That's the thing. If you

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,280
don't like lemon, and some people don't

146
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,199
like the taste, there's a new twist

147
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,600
that's a little less tart. I just made

148
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,040
it for you. Take a look. I got to start

149
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
squeeze it. The nice thing about pomelo

150
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,560
is it's a little less sweet than a

151
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,560
grapefruit and in water.

152
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,080
Pretty good actually. This might be the

153
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,320
new deal. All right, we got lemon juice

154
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
down. Next eating hack to get you out of

155
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,919
a rut is whey protein because research

156
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,360
shows that whey protein can actually

157
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,720
suppress your appetite. Especially when

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,039
you compare it to other proteins, it's

159
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,199
more likely to improve your satiety. You

160
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,840
have a super easy hack, I'm told. Oh,

161
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,120
yes. adding whey protein to a whole slew

162
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,479
of things. You know, I'm a vegetarian,

163
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
so I'm always looking for ways to get

164
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,560
more protein into my diet. So, you can

165
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
add whey protein to your smoothie, which

166
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
is what I do every day, or you can put

167
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,960
it in oatmeal, you can put it in your

168
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,479
yogurt, but this is the hack. Put it in

169
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,919
your coffee. That much? Too much? No,

170
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,199
it's perfect. It's like a creamer. You

171
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,039
want actually you want to add it a

172
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,720
little at a time so it doesn't clump.

173
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,759
And or you can use a little mini whisk,

174
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,000
but you you try try this. It has a nice

175
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,440
creamy flavor and it gives you the

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,039
protein that'll keep you full. You can

177
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,639
go for, you know, hours without being

178
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
hungry after you drink this. Really,

179
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
it's brilliant. Yeah. Why would we ever

180
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,960
use creamers anymore? Seriously, there's

181
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,639
a whole spoonful of protein powder and

182
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,759
you get different flavors, right? This

183
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,520
actually I wouldn't do that. I would not

184
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,919
like do a ch Well, I guess you could do

185
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,560
a cocoa mocha. This is good. This is a

186
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,520
chocolate. You should name this. Yeah.

187
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,479
The Lisa Mocha. Okay. Lisa Mocha Cocoa.

188
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
Yeah, sure. All right. We'll figure

189
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,759
something out. Anyway, the next eating

190
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,120
hack is to create a carb calendar. This

191
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,720
is actually a big issue for a lot of

192
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,479
folks because you know you have to use

193
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,680
whole grains but to use them the right

194
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,840
way. So, how do you get us out of a rut?

195
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,039
Well, we talked I said before one of the

196
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,400
things you know that you need to switch

197
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,319
up is if you're bored and if you're

198
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,240
eating the same grain, say brown rice

199
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,840
every day, you're going to be bored. And

200
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,120
when I get bored, I go for pizza. I

201
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
don't know about you guys, pizza, French

202
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,199
fries, not healthy carbs. So, this is a

203
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,759
way to switch up your healthy carbs.

204
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,319
Choose a different carb every week. It

205
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,720
can be quinoa. It can be millet. It can

206
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,039
be bulgar wheat. It can be barley. Um,

207
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,960
so you pick that on Sunday or Saturday

208
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,479
in the beginning of the week. You make a

209
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,599
big batch of it and you put it in the

210
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,280
refrigerator if you want. You can even

211
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,560
put it in the freezer for later. And

212
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,080
then you can just add in whatever you

213
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,919
want. So how do you how do you actually

214
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,680
make it? Like this is a feroh. This is

215
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,120
ferro, right? Yeah. Pharaoh is actually

216
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
just like a wheat. It is a wheat

217
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
actually. It's a a type of wheat. So

218
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,919
just dump it into boiling water. Here

219
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,240
you go. Mis learning. Like you're making

220
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,639
pasta. Oh yes. Oh, I'm making farrow for

221
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,520
my wife. Oo. And I better put a little

222
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,759
salt in there. I know. That is salt,

223
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,280
right? Yeah, it was salt. And that's how

224
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,479
you do. And then you just add whatever

225
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,160
you want every night. Something

226
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,680
different. Like you could do a Thai

227
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,960
curry vegetable. This is one of the

228
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,639
things that I love. Again, faro is like

229
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,479
pasta. So anything you put on pasta, put

230
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,280
on the faro. Tomatoes, zucchini, a

231
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,720
little grated parmesan, some basil. Just

232
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,000
a little different. And you were saying

233
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,919
you could freeze it. It can last forever

234
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,560
then. Well, not forever. Not through the

235
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,319
zombie apocalypse, but for a long time.

236
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
Up next, if you've been watching what

237
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,720
you eat, I know you've probably been

238
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,160
eating a lot of these of late, right?

239
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Here's the question. Who has the better

240
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,720
egg snack hack? The egg snack hack that

241
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,639
I'm going to offer you is fantastic.

242
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
Lisa's got Well, we'll see. Anyway, find

243
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,560
out whose recipe is going to break the

244
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,639
internet when we come back. We are back

245
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,479
with the family healthy eating hacks to

246
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,639
get you out of a rut. Now, the next hack

247
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,000
has to do with a food that is more Insta

248
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,319
famous than Kylie Jenner. It's got 48

249
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,400
million likes. Look at that. It's an

250
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,639
egg. It's an egg. When you're trying to

251
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
eat healthier, everyone says load up on

252
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,160
hard-boiled eggs for easy protein. But

253
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
listen, guys, that gets sort of boring,

254
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,080
right? I mean, hard-boiled eggs, that's

255
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,680
not so much to that. So, today, who has

256
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,880
the better egg snack hack? Me or

257
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,919
me? I've been campaigning with the

258
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,519
judges, who you'll meet in a few

259
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,279
seconds, whose recipe is going to break

260
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,039
the internet and give that Instagram egg

261
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,760
a run for its money. So, why do you

262
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,839
think you're an expert? Oh, you're such

263
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,360
a punster. Now, you I'm sure you're

264
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,839
alluding to my childhood on the farm

265
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,680
where we had chickens, but I'm not an

266
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,959
expert, but I do love eggs. I love that

267
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,720
they're a great source of protein. I

268
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,040
love that they're cheap, and I love that

269
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
they are so easy. I mean, insanely easy.

270
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,399
No one can. You can't even mess up an

271
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,399
egg. I've tried boiling water, egg, it

272
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,000
works. Bingo. Done. So, I have been

273
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,959
doing my homework, researching eggs up

274
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,560
and down. Have you had no 360 view of an

275
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,480
egg? There's actually a lot of science

276
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,519
to boiling an egg, right? And most of

277
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,440
you don't know this, but you're actually

278
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,680
supposed to begin the by putting the egg

279
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,200
in cold water and heating it up. When

280
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,480
you put the water and the eggs together

281
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,160
and they temp come up in temperature

282
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,000
together, it helps promote even cooking

283
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,760
and prevents cracking. They also want to

284
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,680
add a pinch of salt, right? That can

285
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,760
help solidify the egg white the little

286
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,200
faster. So, it's a perfect egg. So, heat

287
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,720
it up together with the water. Little

288
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,600
pinch of salt. That's a little easy

289
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,120
extra bonus hack. But the basic thing is

290
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,480
timing, right? And you all know this,

291
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,480
but let me put it down in real clear

292
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,839
numbers. If you only boil the egg for

293
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,200
four minutes, which is the right thing

294
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,720
to do, by the way. This is the way he

295
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,399
likes it all runny. You will get it

296
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,560
beautiful. Ooey gooey. Look at this.

297
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,320
It's coming in. Oh, it's fantastic.

298
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Right. This is how I like to eat them.

299
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,959
And again, I like the taste of eggs.

300
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,360
However, if you want a firmer yet still

301
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,920
moderately runny egg, right? Then boil

302
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,839
it for 7

303
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,519
minutes. Is this what you like? No, I'm

304
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,080
down there. Why would anyone want a

305
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,200
10-minute boiled egg? It's a That's a

306
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,800
hardboiled egg. It's just hard. No. How

307
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,800
many hardboiled hard 10-minute people

308
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,560
are out there? Oh my goodness. See,

309
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,560
it tastes like cardboard. Okay, it's the

310
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,120
moment of truth, right? Whose egg snack

311
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,480
hack is better, Lisa's or mine? So, you

312
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,560
get to go. You want to go first? You go

313
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,440
first. Yes, of course. Thank you. No,

314
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,320
this is so simple. We'll take you just a

315
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,160
second. So, I start with avocados. So

316
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
creamy and delicious. You know what? I

317
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,440
actually think of this as like a Do you

318
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,120
guys like egg salad? You guys eat egg

319
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,440
salad? So, this is kind of like a a

320
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,360
healthy version deconstructed egg salad.

321
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,880
And and this instead of mayo, you use

322
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,560
the avocado, which are delicious. Then

323
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,959
you just take a hard-boiled egg. You

324
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,600
chop it up into quarters. Mix it in

325
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,040
there. A little olive oil. Again, some

326
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,040
healthy fats, a little pinch of salt. I

327
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,320
love some chives instead of onion.

328
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,600
They're a type of onion, but they're a

329
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,839
little milder. And then a little

330
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,399
parsley. And it's just like a

331
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:07,440
deconstructed egg salad. What do you

332
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,440
got? That's the best you got. All

333
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,680
right, here's my egg snack hack. I

334
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,760
present to you everybody the Bosphorus

335
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,120
egg, right? It's honor of the Bosphorus

336
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
Strait in Turkey where my parents are

337
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,519
from. This is what the final product

338
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,360
looks like. And I'm going to demonstrate

339
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,760
this. Again, ingredients, pretty simple.

340
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,440
You have an egg, right? You have hummus,

341
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,880
you have some goat cheese, and then you

342
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,920
have some whole grain crackers, right?

343
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,360
All you do, take the eggs. Don't

344
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,120
overcook them like I pointed out

345
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,279
earlier. Put the egg in the middle. Very

346
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,560
symmetrical. A little hummus on top.

347
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,839
See, you don't even know how to make it.

348
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,279
You start with the hummus and the cheese

349
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,800
and you put the egg on top. No, I This

350
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,000
is my variation. Oh, I'm sorry. The

351
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,279
finished one. This is the inside. It's

352
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,320
going to fall apart like that. This is

353
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,360
fantastic. Good lord. Any case, the goat

354
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,200
cheese gives you the extra little

355
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,440
creaminess of fewer calories per ounce

356
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,880
than other popular cheeses. Oh, she's

better, three bike club members who are

363
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,680
harsh critics are tasting away. They

364
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,079
have been evaluating these. We have

365
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,240

366
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,480
meeting of the minds here. So, bike
