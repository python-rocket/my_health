1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,160
A vacation should be a time to

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,480
decompress, disconnect, and relax. But

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,240
before you plan that getaway, could your

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,840
next vacation be dangerous, even deadly?

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,160
Today, we're investigating vacation

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,400
crimes. Why have so many popular

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,039
destination spots become a haven for

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,760
robbery, rape, and even murder against

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,560
unsuspecting Americans? correspondent

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,920
with Marshia Ampo has been investigating

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
something that I never thought we' be

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,760
talking about, but you looked a lot into

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
this. What surprised you the most? What

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,360
stood out? What really surprised me is

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,200
that we're seeing people become victims

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,360
of crime, not when they are going on

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,559
dangerous or risky excursions or going

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,320
to neighborhoods that perhaps they

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,559
should stay away from. It really can

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
happen to anyone at any time. You know,

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,920
Natalie Holloway famously disappeared on

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,160
vacation. She was on a high school

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,160
graduation trip. Much more recently, we

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,320
saw a woman in Mexico who died from

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,920
reportedly drinking tainted alcohol. Who

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,120
doesn't want a cocktail when they're on

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
vacation? That's part of the reason we

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
go on vacation, right? Is to unwind and

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,280
relax. It really can happen to anyone.

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,119
You have to be so vigilant. It seems to

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
me the reports of violence on vacations

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,920
have been increasing. Is that my

33
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,520
perception or is there an increasing

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,960
prevalence? You know, it depends on

35
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
where you're going, but it can be

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,840
shockingly high, including at popular

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,560
vacation spots. For example, in Mexico

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,280
in 2016, 75 Americans were killed while

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,520
traveling there. 75. 75. That's more

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
than the You guys know that? No. It's

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,799
shockingly high. That is more than the

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
number to give you some perspective of

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,439
American travelers killed that entire

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,479
year in every other country of the world

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,680
combined. Another popular vacation spot

46
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,079
is Jamaica, where in 2017, six Americans

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,000
were killed and 12 Americans sexually

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,680
assaulted or raped. And we're not even

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,759
talking about the smaller crimes, you

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,399
know, the robberies, the petty theft. It

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,159
is shockingly high. And are US citizens

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,520
being targeted especially? You know,

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,360
there are two things that are happening

54
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,200
here that we're seeing. For one,

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,200
sometimes people get caught in local

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,280
violence. We saw that last year a woman

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,960
was traveling from Chicago to celebrate

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,600
her wedding anniversary with her husband

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,680
in Mexico. She was hit by a stray bullet

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
in an upscale neighborhood. She was not

61
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
the intended target. She was an innocent

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,480
bystander, but she lost her life. And

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,160
then there are other things that are

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,720
happening. Tourists are extremely

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,400
vulnerable and valuable. So vulnerable

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,239
in the sense that think about it, you

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,920
often don't know the geography. You may

68
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,440
not know the language. Depending on

69
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,360
where you are, you may not even have

70
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,520
cell phone service. That makes you a

71
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,920
vulnerable target and valuable because

72
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Americans are coming from a very wealthy

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,080
country, especially compared to a lot of

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,440
the poor countries that we travel to. So

75
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,959
think about things that you might not

76
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,720
normally think about. an engagement

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,480
ring, a watch. Those things can be

78
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,000
tremendously valuable depending on where

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,360
you're going. With all these insights,

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,720
what's the State Department saying?

81
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,400
What's our government doing? Yeah, the

82
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,480
State Department does issue travel

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,519
boardings and several popular spots are

84
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,160
on a list right now, including Mexico,

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,080
the Bahamas, Biz, the Dominican

86
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,879
Republic, hotspots, and they are

87
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,440
advising Americans traveling there to

88
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,840
exercise increased caution. Another one

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,159
that you saw on that list, Jamaica. One

90
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,800
travel company ranked it the third most

91
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,000
dangerous place in the world for female

92
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,360
travelers. Jeez, these are places that I

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
see advertisements for all the time,

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,159
places that I've gone to and I've

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,760
enjoyed. Yeah. And and you have to keep

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,280
in mind that plenty of people go there

97
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,120
without incident and have a great time.

98
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,200
And these countries thrive on the

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,879
tourist economy. So we want to be be

100
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
mindful of that. But you also have to

101
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,360
protect yourself. They don't want it

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,640
either. But the question is, what are we

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,000
doing about it? What can we do to be

104
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,480
safer? So let's get to the case of

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
Desiree Gibbon. She was from New York,

106
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
was found murdered in Jamaica. What do

107
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,080
we know about her and what happened

108
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,159
there? Yeah, this is really such a sad

109
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,000
case. She was in Montego Bay because her

110
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,319
family had some connections there. She

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,080
was there for a month and three days

112
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,480
before she was scheduled to leave, she

113
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,000
was found dead on the side of a remote

114
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,080
dirt road with her throat slashed. Oh my

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,920
goodness. So, let's get into this a

116
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
little bit. We have the autopsy report.

117
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,360
This was a serious attack. it. The

118
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
autopsy report shows that she had

119
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,439
massive bleeding and a chopping wound.

120
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,920
That's their word, chopping wound to her

121
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,720
neck. In fact, that injury severed her

122
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,280
corateed artery, her jugular vein, and

123
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,120
her trachea. You know how hard you have

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,760
to cut at someone to cut that deeply? It

125
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,440
went all the way down into her spine.

126
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
Now, putting it together, she had linear

127
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,359
wounds on her hand. So, in theory, she

128
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,360
they think she may have been kneeling

129
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,120
and the perpetrator was behind her. She

130
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,800
put her hand up to defend herself. So,

131
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
the knife would have cut her hand. And

132
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,320
in fact there were cuts on her right

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
hand on the palmer surface. Uh and then

134
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,880
the injury came along this side of her

135
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,600
neck and by cutting here went very deep.

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,919
So it gives you the idea that the there

137
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,960
was probably a man because the deep cut

138
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,400
was it was uh uh done by someone who was

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,199
probably left-handed based on the

140
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,120
injuries that we see. So these are just

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,720
highlevel insights you might gain from

142
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,000
looking at the op autopsy report but

143
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,840
you've gained a lot of additional

144
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,560
insights. Yeah. For one thing, and you

145
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,479
describe the viciousness of that attack,

146
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,919
that indicates that kind of attack

147
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
indicates that this may have been

148
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,840
personal in nature, that this may have

149
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,320
been someone who knew her and that this

150
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,320
was a personal um interaction. The other

151
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,960
thing is that it may not have been just

152
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,600
one person when you describe how brutal

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,759
this attack was. And it's worth pointing

154
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
out she was not sexually assaulted. So

155
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,240
that was not a motive here. So these

156
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,800
things tend to point to the idea that

157
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,479
this was somebody that she knew. So, up

158
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,840
next, Desiree Gibbons's mother is here.

159
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,440
She's speaking out about what she thinks

160
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
happened and why she believes police are

161
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,919
not actively looking for her daughter's

162
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,240
killer. Stay with us. That was Desiree

163
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,639
Gibbon, a 26-year-old model and actress

164
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,800
from United States who was found

165
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,280
murdered in Montego Bay, Jamaica, after

166
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
visiting the island on vacation. A year

167
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,520
after her death, her murder still is

168
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,520
unsolved. And Desire's mother, Andrea,

169
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,759
is here. Tell me about your daughter.

170
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,360
Desiree is the best person you would

171
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,840
have ever ever met in your life. She was

172
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,639
she was a wonderlust.

173
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,759
She enjoyed

174
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,280
cultures of all kind. She traveled the

175
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,759
world.

176
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,600
She was just one who wanted to travel

177
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,840
and just get to know people and get to

178
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,919
know the world. So, what was the last

179
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
time you spoke to your daughter and how

180
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,840
did she seem to you?

181
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,440
The last time I spoke to her was

182
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,479
probably about 9:30 p.m. on Thanksgiving

183
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,160
of 2017.

184
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,560
She was the happiest that I'd ever heard

185
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,479
her. She felt good things were happening

186
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,680
for her. She had gone on vacation there

187
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,400
and she wanted to spend a month. You

188
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,520
know, her grandparents have a bread and

189
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,039
breakfast in Montego Bay.

190
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,440
So, she went down. She said, "Mom, I'll

191
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,919
go for a month." So fine, she had been

192
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,960
there many times throughout her life.

193
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,960
And during her course there, she was um,

194
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,120
you know, going around to the, you know,

195
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,880
the local places where they have the

196
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,360
clubs and Margaritavville and things.

197
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,120
She says, you know, mom, maybe I'll do

198
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,400
bartending when I'm here because she was

199
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,000
an actress and a model and that's what

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,639
she did to support herself here in New

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,960
York. So she sounds good to you. This is

202
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,599
at 9:30 the night she disappears.

203
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,120
Correct. Was there anything unusual

204
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,000
about what was happening in her life

205
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,280
around then? Any out of the ordinary

206
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,240
events? The only thing that struck me is

207
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,160
odd is she deleted her Instagram.

208
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,000
So when I was trying to communicate with

209
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,319
her on Instagram, it wasn't going

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,759
through. So I asked her that day, "What

211
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,080
happened to your Instagram?" She's like,

212
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,599
"Oh, I'm taking a break. I deleted it."

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,120
So, I don't know if she had an

214
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,680
experience of somebody trying to contact

215
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,759
her through Instagram and therefore to

216
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,080
avoid it, she just disconnected

217
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,759
everything. I'm not sure. Were you

218
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,479
concerned about her safety at all while

219
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,000
she was in Jamaica? Honestly, I was not.

220
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,160
2020 hindsight, I didn't know, but I was

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,280
not concerned at all. All right. So,

222
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,360
everything seems normal with the

223
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,199
exception of this Instagram deletion. So

224
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,199
3 days before Desiree was scheduled to

225
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,840
fly home, the evening that she spoke to

226
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,960
her mom, her body was found in an

227
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,759
abandoned driveway. Mhm. What was like

228
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:15,280
to get that phone call? Oh god, was

229
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,840
horrific. I was sitting at work when her

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,160
uncle called me and told me I needed to

231
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,800
go home, that something happened and to

232
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,960
call him back on that number. And I told

233
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,680
him, "I'm at work. I'm in a meeting. I'm

234
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,759
not going home. what's the matter? So he

235
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,759
it was all through text message. So then

236
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,760
I text my husband. I said, "Your brother

237
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,159
just called me. What's going on? Is

238
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Desiree okay?"

239
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
He tried to call me and because I was in

240
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,640
a meeting, I just hit can't talk right

241
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,800
now. And he sent me a message. My mother

242
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,399
just told me they killed my daughter.

243
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,560
I w was devastated. I could not move.

244
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,560
Sitting in the boardroom,

245
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,600
I didn't know what to do.

246
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,800
I didn't know what to do. Ultimately,

247
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,200
I got up and excused myself and went

248
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,519
into my office and called my husband.

249
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,399
And when I heard him screaming on the

250
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,920
phone, I knew.

251
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,080
I just knew it was true.

252
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,959
So, you're a nurse. Mhm. You've dealt

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,279
with pain and loss. Mhm. Now, you have

254
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,279
to apply that skill to dealing with your

255
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,760
own daughter. Yeah. A couple of days

256
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,040
after Desiree was killed, Mhm. you

257
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,920
arrived in Jamaica. Mhm. You had to

258
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,880
identify the body, right? What was that

259
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,240
like?

260
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,160
That was extremely difficult. And I did

261
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,399
not expect to see what I saw. When they

262
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,000
originally walked me into the area where

263
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,680
they were going to perform the autopsy,

264
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,440
I couldn't recognize her because the

265
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,080
body that I was looking at, and of

266
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,120
course they only show you the face,

267
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,279
um, didn't look like her. She was

268
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,680
decomposed.

269
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,800
Her skin turned completely black and she

270
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,040
wasn't a dark-kinned person. So, I

271
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,360
couldn't understand why she looked like

272
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,600
this. And I kept saying, "This is not

273
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,600
her." And my husband's saying, "It's

274
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,800
her." I said, "It's not her. How can you

275
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,519
tell?" He said, "It's her."

276
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,880
And it was I was devastated. I honestly

277
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,160
thought they walked me in there and was

278
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,160
taking me to some different body.

279
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,040
You saw probably some of the wounds.

280
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:36,480
Maybe you saw the report. I did see the

281
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:39,200
report. I saw when we were there because

282
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,800
I could not identify my daughter. My

283
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,640
husband asked to see the picture of the

284
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,079
crime scene where they first found her

285
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,560
on the uh street. That picture I could

286
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,720
identify her and it had very graphically

287
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,079
her throat slit with all the blood

288
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,800
crusted around her throat.

289
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,279
That I knew was Desiree.

290
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,959
I'm so sorry.

291
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,040
No parent should ever have to see that.

292
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,040
Yeah.

293
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,399
We have footage of your daughter. This

294
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,240
is exclusive video of the last time

295
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,480
Desiree was seen. It's from a security

296
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
camera in the hotel. I want to show it

297
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,360
to the audience and then if it's okay, I

298
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
want to talk to you about it. Sure.

299
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,160
Right. So that uh top left panel, you'll

300
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
see uh a little circle that's following

301
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,440
Desiree out of her room downstairs. Now

302
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,839
she's in the top right panel, the

303
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,279
hallway walking towards the lobby of the

304
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,560
hotel. And then we'll pick it up in the

305
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,040
bottom left. Uh, Desiree will appear,

306
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,079
walk through the lobby of the hotel. And

307
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
as you're looking at this, I want to

308
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,480
point something out because she's going

309
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,399
to walk through the lobby of the hotel

310
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,160
without really stopping, and then out

311
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,240
into the front of the hotel, which is

312
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,800
the bottom right panel. And notice she's

313
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,720
got flip-flops on, shorts, not carrying

314
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,399
anything that we can really tell. And

315
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,959
then she goes around the corner right

316
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,160
there, and just out of sight, apparently

317
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,079
was picked up in a car, it appears. So,

318
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,279
so as you look at that security footage,

319
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,480
what does that tell you about your

320
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,120
daughter?

321
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,160
she was going to meet somebody she knew.

322
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,720
It is somebody who called her, said,

323
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,480
"Come outside." Um, for whatever reason,

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
uh, because she came the first time she

325
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,560
came down, you could see her looking

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,480
through the door. She was looked like

327
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,839
texting on her phone talking to the

328
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,000
security guard, went back up to the

329
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,440
hotel room. The only difference when she

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,440
came down that second time is she had

331
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,720
put a pair of sunglasses on her head.

332
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,480
Clear pair of sunglasses and came back

333
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,880
down, said something to the security

334
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
guard and looked at her phone again and

335
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,079
then went through the door. And as she

336
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,320
made that left, that was the last time

337
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,560
she was ever seen. Why would she put on

338
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,200
a pair of sunglasses? I have no idea.

339
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,440
Just an accessory, I I guess. And the

340
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,560
security guard have any insights at all?

341
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,240
None. In fact, when he was questioned,

342
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,040
um, he had said that when Desire was

343
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,959
leaving, she said, "I'll be right back."

344
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,800
Are you satisfied with how police are

345
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,800
investigating this case? No,

346
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,760
not at all.

347
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,760
I'm extremely frustrated with the

348
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,240
authorities down there. It's very

349
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,079
difficult to get answers from them.

350
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,839
Um,

351
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,760
you know, from the very beginning, there

352
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,639
was a flip-flop they found at the crime

353
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,079
scene and the one of the detectives took

354
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,880
it back to the hotel and just threw it

355
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,600
in her hotel room on the floor. So, it

356
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,360
wasn't taken for evidence of any kind.

357
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,959
And

358
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,160
when they went to the hotel to go

359
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,160
through her room, um, she had a local

360
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,680
cell phone she bought in Jamaica. I

361
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,440
found it in one of her bags there as I

362
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,519
was packing up to bring her things home

363
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
when we were leaving.

364
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,399
and because they were asking about her

365
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,920
cell phones. And fast forward a year

366
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,240
later when I went down for the one-y

367
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,000
year anniversary, I had inquired about

368
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,000
that phone and if they had contacted the

369
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,360
people inside that phone and they looked

370
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,800
at me like I was crazy and they said,

371
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,560
"What phone?" There was never a phone. I

372
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,800
said, "Yeah, there was a phone." And you

373
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,560
know, I had taken pictures of everything

374
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,320
in the phone. And I said, "But what

375
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,000
about this person? Did you contact them?

376
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,519
Did you investigate this one?" "Oh, we

377
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,120
don't know anything about that phone."

378
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,959
So, one detective looks at another and

379
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
says, "Oh, we sent it to Kingston, but

380
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,040
it there was nothing in there. It didn't

381
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,760
Their their line is," it didn't prove

382
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,600
fruitful to our investigation. So, I

383
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,480
know you haven't gotten much of response

384
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,839
from them, right? But we did. We got a

385
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,680
statement from the police. When we come

386
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
back, the latest on the investigation

387
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
and what you needed to know about

388
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,040
staying safe and protecting yourself

389
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,639
while you're on vacation. Desiree Gibbon

390
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,639
was murdered while vacationing in

391
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,320
Jamaica. Her body was found just three

392
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,880
days before she was scheduled to fly

393
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,320
back home to New York. Desire's mother,

394
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
Andrea, is back and joining her is

395
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,079
private investigator TJ Ward, who also

396
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,680
investigated the Natalie Holloway

397
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,360
disappearance. She got some experience

398
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,519
in the area. We reached out to the

399
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Montego Bay Police Department. We asked

400
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,120
whether they were prioritizing Desire's

401
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,720
case. Here's what they said in part.

402
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,040
This particular matter is being given

403
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,440
high priority, attention, and is being

404
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,680
treated as a significant investigation.

405
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,519
statement goes on to say they've pursued

406
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,440
and continue to pursue several leads.

407
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,199
They have interviewed several people and

408
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,959
they're analyzing a number of items for

409
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,440
forensic evidence. We got the full

410
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,399
statement on dr.com.

411
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,160
Andrew, I know they haven't been

412
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,639
forthcoming with you, but they did share

413
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,639
a little bit of an update with us. What

414
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,720
do you think about their claims, their

415
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,440
statement?

416
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,959
I think it's amazing that they would

417
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,480
respond in such a way where I can't even

418
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,160
get them to answer a message. it'll take

419
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,800
him sometimes a week or two weeks to get

420
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,440
back to me and the only statement I keep

421
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,199
getting is there have been no new leads.

422
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,839
So that's very interesting that you were

423
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,720
able to obtain that statement. TJ, why

424
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,880
did you decide to get involved? Well, I

425
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,040
was asked to get involved and we have

426
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,680
expertise that work in cases outside the

427
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,519
country and we want to take our

428
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,360
expertise and assist the Jamaica police

429
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,959
with things they may have missed or

430
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,759
followed up with. And what's it going to

431
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,279
take to find the killer? Well, there's

432
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,320
certain things that I have seen already

433
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,120
in the case, uh, such as the second

434
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,040
phone that was found, and there was a

435
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,120
array of numbers were in that phone that

436
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,600
apparently have not been identified. And

437
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,399
we need to identify those and identify

438
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,959
other witnesses in this case that may be

439
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,320
important to lead us to this heinous

440
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,480
crime. Are you going to look into her

441
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,079
Instagram account and why it was

442
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,440
discontinued? We're going to follow

443
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,560
every lead and work hands-on with Andrea

444
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,800
to try to establish who the killers are

445
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,639
and hope to get results from our

446
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,480
investigation. Andrew, what do you think

447
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,440
happened to your daughter? You know her

448
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,800
better than anybody.

449
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,199
I honestly have no idea. I I do know

450
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,079
that whoever killed her is somebody she

451
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,360
knew. I had heard at one point through

452
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:48,720
the underground in Jamaica that there

453
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,000
was um a gentleman who was interested in

454
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,399
Desiree and she was not interested. Uh

455
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,199
and I was told that when this particular

456
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,320
individual saw her talking to another

457
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,720
person, he became very jealous and he is

458
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,079
the one who killed her. I don't know

459
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,240
that to be true. That's what they're

460
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,679
saying in the undergrounds of Jamaica.

461
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,199
And people will tell you, everybody

462
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,120
knows what happened to her, but nobody's

463
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,640
willing to talk.

464
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,079
Well, I look forward to hearing your

465
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,600
investigation. We'll follow the case

466
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,120
with you. This crime should be solved.

467
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,520
Thank you again for coming. I want to go

468
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,039
back to our correspondent, Marciao, who

469
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,319
has some tips on protecting ourselves

470
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,079
when we're away on vacation. These are

471
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,079
vitally important ideas. I had never

472
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,760
even thought of some of these concepts,

473
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,880
but we can do things to stay safe while

474
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,640
on vacation. You spent a good part of

475
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
your life traveling the country. Yeah, I

476
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,320
used to live on the road the whole world

477
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,320
and even to conflict zones. And you want

478
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,240
to make sure that you do not let your

479
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,679
guard down. A lot of times we're on

480
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
vacation. We don't take the precautions

481
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,559
we would normally take because we want

482
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,400
to relax and let our hair down. You can

483
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,320
do that, but you also have to be smart.

484
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
So, for one thing, travel in groups.

485
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,559
Don't go places alone. And keep in mind

486
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,160
that these attacks can even occur at the

487
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,799
hotel or the resort that you're staying

488
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,160
in, even upscale places. Try not to

489
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,440
overdo it with the drinking. I know

490
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,120
nobody wants to hear that. The other

491
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,799
option is you can just have a designated

492
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,080
sober person in your group. One person

493
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,000
who's kind of looking out for everyone

494
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,000
else. The second thing is is your hotel

495
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,520
room is really important. Now, when I

496
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,799
was living on the road as a reporter, I

497
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,960
had a cameraman who used to call me

498
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,039
Goldilocks because my room had to be

499
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,880
just right. I would go back to the desk

500
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,039
two and three times until I got a room I

501
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,039
felt safe in. Don't stay on a floor

502
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,480
that's too low and easily accessible

503
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,400
from the street. You don't want to stay

504
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,320
in a room that's remote, that's too far

505
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,640
away from all the action, or that's near

506
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,400
a dark stairwell. Make sure you use the

507
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,960
deadbolt because there have been cases

508
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,679
where hotel employees with keys have

509
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,000
been the perpetrators of crime. And this

510
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,799
is my favorite travel gadget of all

511
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,200
time. It's light. It's easy to pack. So,

512
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,559
this is a doors stop. It's a doors stop.

513
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,160
You shove it under the door. You put it

514
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,760
under the door. It's battery operated.

515
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,000
So, on the back, you turn it on when

516
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,080
you're ready to use it. You put it under

517
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,919
the door and it does two things. One, if

518
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,160
someone tries to come in, it stops the

519
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,720
door. And when this is triggered, it

520
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,320
sets off a piercing alarm. Oh, I see.

521
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,480
Yes. You see this? This actually goes up

522
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,919
and down. So when the door, if someone

523
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,679
does try to push the door open, it stops

524
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,360
the door, but it also triggers the

525
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,000
alarm. Good. It's like carrying a

526
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,000
personal security system. And in a case

527
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,840
where it might be a hotel employee with

528
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,760
a key, you're going to throw them so off

529
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,919
guard because they're not expecting an

530
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,640
alarm in the room. This I never travel

531
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,160
without it. Well, there should be this

532
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,520
best a part of everyone's travel kit.

533
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,039
Well, thank you very much. We'll be

534
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,280
right back. Everybody, thank you for

535
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,280
watching.
