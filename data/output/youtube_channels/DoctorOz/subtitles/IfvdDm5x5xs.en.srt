00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,560
Today on Dr. Oz, new uses for everyday

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,720
things, summer edition. And the best

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,599
part is these great ideas are absolutely

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,840
free and they really work. Deodorant as

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,720
nail polish remover. This one I've got

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,880
to see. Watermelon to prevent wrinkles.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,199
I think you should try it. A new twist

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,560
for flipflops and how tea can make your

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,960
toes smell better. It works. Coming up

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,320
next on Dr. Oz.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,719
[Applause]

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,640
Thank you everybody. It is July and

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,120
everyone is stocking up on summer

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,760
essentials, including me. Deodorant,

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,120
check. Flip-flops, check. Watermelon and

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,719
iced tea, check, check, check. Check.

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,600
All the good stuff. Because today there

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,440
are new health uses for everyday things.

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,520
And the best part is these great ideas

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,360
are absolutely free and they really

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,120
work. You know how I know that? Because

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,879
you have tried them. In fact, you're

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,960
going to reveal them to me. First up is

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,600
Carol. She says she has the new health

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,320
uses for her summer essential, which is

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,760
deodorant. How are you, Carol? How are

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,519
you? And the first thing you apparently

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,080
like deodorant for is as a nail polish

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,159
remover. Nail polish remover. Why not?

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,000
So, basically, you take a nail polish

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,560
rem the spray, I'm sorry, and you spray

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,159
it on your nail, making sure that you

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,880
don't get your skin because you don't

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,720
want to get freezer wipe. Then you you

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,119
let it just sit for a little bit. You

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,200
take your cotton

37
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,040
ball, you take it off. Oh my goodness.

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,439
Look at that. To come off. Yeah. And you

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,400
don't have the smell of that um acetone.

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,439
How would you ever figure that out?

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,960
I mean, honest to goodness, why would

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,479
you ever think nail polish could be

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,799
removed with that deodorant because

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,720
deodorant just has lots of uses. So, why

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,040
not try it? And again, it doesn't have

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,560
that acetone and it has to be the spray.

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,159
Has to be the spray. Yeah. You can't use

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
a roll on. It has to be the spray. Any

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,640
spray will work. Any kind. Any spray

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
will work as long as you spray it. You

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
leave it on for a little bit. Let it get

52
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,799
saturated. Don't get it on your skin.

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,479
Get a cotton. I love when you guys come

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,680
up with these ideas. It's so smart. The

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,759
other thing I understand you do with

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,479
deodorant is you get into your jeans.

57
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,600
Yes, I do. I get into my

58
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,600
tight. You actually got some proof for

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,719
us, don't you? I sure do. Take a look at

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,200
this. I use deodorant on my legs to slip

61
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,160
into tight pants. It's my favorite

62
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,319
summer fix. I take any deodorant, apply

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,200
it all over my legs, and then slip into

64
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,720
my favorite skinny jeans. It works great

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,760
every time. There you have it. Deodorant

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,280
is not just for under your arms anymore.

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,920
Are these the jeans? These are the

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,760
jeans. But they fit perfectly. Yep. Not

69
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,760
just for your armpits deodorant. Who

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,120
would have thought? Once again, I have

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,640
to ask, why would you ever think I mean,

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,000
no, most people do not put deodorant on

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,120
their thighs, right? That's what my

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,480
husband said. Basically, what I do,

75
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,599
understandably is I took the deodorant

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,440
because when I come out of the shower,

77
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,360
I'm a little bit clammy. My skin is not,

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,720
you know, really smooth. So, I decided,

79
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,040
well, let's see what's the worst that

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,800
can happen. I rubbed it up and down. I

81
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,160
put one leg the other leg and before I

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,160
knew it, I slipped them up and I was

83
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,239
good to go. You're a very industrious

84
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,440
woman. I try. So, this time of year, a

85
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,640
lot of mosquitoes, right? See if this

86
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,920
picture looks familiar to you. These

87
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,400
things buzzing around there. And Carol

88
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,400
says she uses deodorant to take the itch

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,720
out of mosquito bites. This one I've got

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,879
to see. That is correct. So, basically,

91
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,519
when you get a mosquito bite, you take a

92
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,120
deodorant stick. You simply just I

93
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
pretend I was bitten here. Fantastic.

94
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
Right here, you pour. You just rub it

95
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
back and forth a little bit and before

96
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,319
you know it, that sting goes away. You

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,239
don't feel the itch. You don't have to

98
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,920
rub it in a bite. No, because now just

99
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
let it be. No pun intended. Just let

100
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Very, very good. Thank you. Actually,

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
you know, come over here for a second. I

102
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,560
want you to help me, though. I got some

103
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,760
watermelon here. I love watermelon this

104
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,200
summer. It's so sweet. So, if you don't

105
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,480
mind, hand that out to the audience.

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,080
I'll take a couple of these to our guys

107
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,280
here.

108
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,319
All all the eaters out there. By the

109
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,879
way, here napkins here. Throw these

110
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,680
napkins around there.

111
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,440
So Natasha, Dalita, and Caitlyn, they've

112
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
all created a very interesting way of

113
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,319
using watermelon. They have a watermelon

114
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,480
skin spa here. You can pass that around,

115
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,599
too. Go take that up there. Thank you.

116
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,280
Don't spill it for the people in front

117
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,280
of you. Okay. In this spa, they're going

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,560
to show us their everyday uses for this

119
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,480
summer item. Natasha's going to start us

120
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,360
off. She uses watermelon to prevent

121
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,920
wrinkles. Yes. You already had it on. I

122
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,080
already have it on. The wrinkles are

123
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,200
going away as we're talking right now. I

124
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,640
literally see no wrinkles, but I see

125
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,959
other things there. So, what are you

126
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,360
wearing? It's a very simple facial mask.

127
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,840
It's one teaspoon of watermelon, one

128
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,440
teaspoon of crushed avocado. Leave it on

129
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,919
for 20 minutes, and it's going to

130
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,560
moisturize. It's going to replenish any

131
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,400
lost water into your skin, and you're

132
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,720
just going to feel great. I think you

133
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:32,000
should try it.

134
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,759
Well, it feels good. It does feel good.

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,960
It tastes good. It tastes good. Yeah.

136
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,160
Once again, I'm so fascinated the

137
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,199
viewers come up with these ideas. This

138
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
is not one of the obvious things you

139
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
would do to your face. It's not. But I'm

140
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,600
from California. We use avocados for

141
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,759
everything. So, why not put it on your

142
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,160
face and have the oil moisturize your

143
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,080
skin? Let me see myself in here. Yeah, I

144
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,440
like it. Yeah, I I could go there. And

145
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,360
it's really refreshing. You could feel

146
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,880
the the cool watermelon. I like the idea

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,160
of using the avocado because it's been

148
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,360
useful in many other areas. And I think

149
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,880
the idea on skin makes sense. Okay,

150
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960
that's the first big problem. Dry skin

151
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,720
is very common. Delita uses it to help

152
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
her deal with the dry skin that

153
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,280
understandably you have trouble soothing

154
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,720
sometimes. Yes. Yes, I do. So up with

155
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,600
this mixture and what you want to do is

156
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,840
a teaspoon of watermelon juice, teaspoon

157
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
of honey. Just mix it together. Apply it

158
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,520
on the face. Leave it on for 20 minutes.

159
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,960
And then while you're waiting that 20

160
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,400
minutes, you can put a little tea little

161
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,639
honey and tea and have a little piece of

162
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,639
watermelon damp cloth. We could combine

163
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,039
these two approaches. Have a full meal.

164
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,960
Yeah. Have a spa party. Well, I I I get

165
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,160
honey as a as a emoleant, right? It

166
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,919
would seal the moisture. And I guess the

167
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,680
watermelon must get in there first.

168
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,479
Absolutely. Because watermelon is about

169
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,840
90% water, so that's more hydration.

170
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,600
It's got lycopine, too, which I also

171
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,800
love. Wonderful. Great idea. And how

172
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,320
long does it take for you to see the

173
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
results that you desire? Uh, actually,

174
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,240
for me, immediately. Leave it on for 20

175
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,800
minutes. Nice warm cloth to take it off.

176
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,639
I could actually feel how soft my skin

177
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,880
was. That meant hydration. Helps the

178
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,720
heat, too. Finally, Kayla's here. She

179
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,800
uses watermelon to treat summertime

180
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,639
breakouts. Is that a common phenomenon

181
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,639
for you? Yeah, definitely. Um,

182
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,400
especially with the gym, working out, a

183
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,120
lot of time the sweat on my face can

184
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,039
lead to acne and breakouts. Um, so I

185
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,440
came up with this mixture. It's one

186
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,000
teaspoon of watermelon juice and one

187
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,720
teaspoon of mashed bananas. Put it on

188
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,639
your face, leave it for 15 minutes. Um,

189
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,360
and then instantly within a week, I saw

190
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,520
better results. Um, and I use it. I

191
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,960
still use it all year round, too. Yep.

192
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,240
You know, I guess one thing I I like

193
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,840
about the concept in general is that

194
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,000
it's, you know, a lot of moisturizers

195
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,600
are oily, so they'll clog the pores. So,

196
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,080
if you can use watermelon, doesn't do

197
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,160
that. No, not at all. And I had tried

198
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
other products before. Um, they don't

199
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
work and you can spend a lot of money on

200
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,600
them. I was looking for an allnatural

201
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,280
fix. So, I went with this and right away

202
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,319
within a week, my skin was great. Well,

203
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,319
I'm very proud of you. Keep going to the

204
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,919
gym, by the way. All right. So, I've got

205
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,199
another everyday use for a very common

206
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,039
thing that you all have. It's an old

207
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,880
pair of shoes like these flip-flops.

208
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,800
Now, Angelique has found some very

209
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,360
creative new ways, healthy, valuable

210
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,639
ways of using old flip-flops.

211
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,160
Hi, Dr. Oz. I'm Angelique. I'm going to

212
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:05,599
show you three uses for flip-flops in

213
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,800
the summer. The first use is a squeegee

214
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,400
to remove all excess soap and water when

215
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,280
cleaning surfaces. Second, use as a

216
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,479
doors stop. Wedge it underneath the door

217
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,840
for a cost effective doors stop. The

218
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,039
third use is as a pet hair collector.

219
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,000
Sweep the floors, sofas to pick up the

220
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:33,120
pesty clumps of hair.

221
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,720
Yes, it's off my floor.

222
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,400
I love that concept. You know, I have a

223
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,759
lot of pets. These are pictures of me. I

224
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,319
took actually last night. These are all

225
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,080
my rabbit Buster and and Rocky the cat

226
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,360
and of course Rosie. All different

227
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,720
colors, but they all have lots of hair.

228
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm going to start using my flip-flops

229
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
or other kinds of old shoes to clear up

230
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,199
those those hairs. So, we'll try it and

231
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
see if it works. Okay, let's get to one

232
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,960
more health use for a summertime staple.

233
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,639
It's iced tea. Molly, if you don't mind

234
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,000
joining me. So, you say you can use this

235
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,680
head to toe. So, let's start with the

236
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,479
head. I understand you use it for for

237
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,720
grays. Yes. I um do three tea bags in

238
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,199
boiling hot water with rosemary and

239
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,039
sage. Let it steep overnight and then I

240
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,360
spray it on my roots and it takes away

241
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,879
the grays for a few days. Why? There no

242
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,400
there no grays up there for sure. I use

243
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,639
it in between when I can't get to the

244
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,840
salon or if I'm busy or whatnot. So, I

245
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,840
understand you had a friend actually do

246
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,720
this. Here's before and after picture.

247
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,319
Is that right? So, she can do her full

248
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
hair because she's brunette. But as me

249
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,560
being blonde, I just do my root area.

250
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,080
That's a big difference. Yeah. Yeah.

251
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,840
Surprising, isn't it? But, you know,

252
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,360
think about it. You know, dark tea will

253
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,640
stain cups. It'll stain your teeth,

254
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,000
right? Yes. So, why wouldn't it stay in

255
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
your hair at least for a short period of

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,440
time? So, I like Yes. And I use black

257
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,719
tea. So, perfect. I don't know. Now, I

258
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,159
said head to toe. So, that's the head

259
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,320
part. Let's go to the toe part. So, also

260
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,959
I would steep um a couple tea bags in

261
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,720
hot or warm lukewarm water and soak my

262
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,440
feet in it to get rid of the summertime

263
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,600
odors from slip-on shoes and that type

264
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,640
of Do you folks have odors usually in

265
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,480
your uh in your toes and feet? No. Let's

266
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,680
just do you since it's your idea. You

267
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,680
sit over there. You smell your feet. I

268
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,440
usually they're steeping in it. I will.

269
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,040
Okay. All right. So, let's come on. Just

270
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,519
check it out here. I'll do one toe. You

271
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,920
do one toe. Let's go. Baby feet. Yeah.

272
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,000
Smells like tea. Smells like tea. It

273
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,920
works. It does. Mhm. Thank you very

274
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,240
much, Molly. Thank you. Anything else?

275
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,160
Are you good? No, I'm good. Thank you. I

276
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
like the tea because it helps dry out

277
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,490
the feet. One of the reasons they work

278
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,169
so well. We'll be right back.

279
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,169
[Applause]

280
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,279
Next, Olympic swimming legend Amy Van

281
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,360
Dyken. The day her world changed when an

282
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,360
accident left her paralyzed, undaunted,

283
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,880
and unbroken. How she came back stronger

284
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,040
than ever. I'm going to live every

285
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,080
single moment to its fullest. Her

286
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,160
winning spirit is a lesson to us all.

287
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,560
Next, all new odds. Tips from a

288
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,880
worldrenowned cancer fighter. A very

289
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,720
special guest shares a provocative new

290
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,040
way to help you prevent the disease you

291
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,160
fear most. He even introduced me to my

292
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,160
wife. He my father-in-law.

293
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,760
Stop cancer before it even starts. This

294
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
is practical information oncologists

295
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,800
right now are using in their practice.

296
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,200
Steps everyone should take to live

297
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,780
cancer-free. All new Oz. That's coming

298
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,870
up on

299
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,009
[Applause]

300
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,009
[Music]

301
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,279
Monday. I've been waiting for this show

302
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,839
all year long. Today, how one of

303
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,160
swimming's iconic Olympic legends, Amy

304
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,760
Van Dyken, is turning her injury into

305
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,839
inspiration.

306
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,000
Decorated Olympic swimmer Amy Van Dykin

307
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,240
has been going for the gold all her

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,200
life. She was the most successful

309
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,440
athlete at the 1996 Summer Olympics in

310
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,680
Atlanta, winning four gold medals,

311
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,320
accomplishing what no other American

312
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,120
woman had done before. Her success

313
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,000
landed her on the iconic Wedis box, made

314
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,480
her ESPN's female athlete of the year,

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,600
and got her inducted into the US Olympic

316
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,320
Hall of Fame. In 2000, Amy won two more

317
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,680
gold medals in Sydney, setting even more

318
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,160
American and world records. After six

319
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,440
gold medals, Amy retired and married

320
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,079
former Denver Broncos punter Tom Ruan.

321
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,480
But this past summer, a tragic accident

322
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,360
changed Amy's life forever. Losing

323
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,519
control of her ATV, Amy drove over the

324
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,839
side of an embankment, severing her

325
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,480
spine and leaving her paralyzed from the

326
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,800
waist down. Today, how the beloved

327
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,959
Olympian is facing her biggest challenge

328
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,920
of

329
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,079
all. Amy Van Dykin is here. I remember

330
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,800
hearing the story when we spoke over the

331
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,720
summer. Uh it still to me is sort of

332
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,200
stunning and I have no idea how you

333
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,560
cope. So, if you don't mind, the key

334
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,920
question for me is was there ever a

335
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,120
point throughout this process where you

336
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,440
just wanted to throw the towel in where

337
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,480
you wanted to give up? Never. Not one

338
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,040
time. I'm so happy, Dr. Oz, to be here

339
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,920
every single day. I'm living on borrowed

340
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,920
time. I'm not supposed to be here. So,

341
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,240
I'm going to live every single moment to

342
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,880
its fullest. Turn lemons into lemon

343
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,880
cello, if you

344
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,480
will. So, that picture that we just

345
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,920
showed everybody of the spine that was

346
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,440
severed, that that's your spine. And

347
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,279
right next to the spine is the aorta,

348
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,200
the big blood tube. So, the operation

349
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,720
they had to do to stabilize you was a

350
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,360
very dangerous one. This is an operation

351
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,880
that people died during. In fact, the se

352
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
this the risk and severity was so

353
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,639
significant you said goodbye to your

354
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,040
husband. I understand before you went

355
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,639
into the O. I did. Yeah. My doctor, my

356
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,720
neurosurgeon, Dr. Tumi Allen said,

357
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,079
"Listen, I'm working in nanometers.

358
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,600
Chances are you're not going to make it

359
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,000
out. So, you guys need to say goodbye

360
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,399
just in case." And I thought in that

361
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,560
moment, I said, "Listen, in order for

362
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,959
him to live a full life, let him date."

363
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,040
So, I said, "You could move on. You

364
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,160
know, date, do what you need to do."

365
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
Because you hear stories about people

366
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,639
going, "I don't know what my spouse

367
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,240
would want me to do. Would they want me

368
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,200
to date?" And I wanted him to know that

369
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,639
it was okay. But surgery was over. And I

370
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
immediately, first thing I had to do was

371
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,680
say, "Whoa, whoa, take it back."

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,680
And who's the hot blonde in the corner?

373
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,680
No. That's right.

374
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,480
These are trying moments. Yeah. What

375
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,639
inspired you to keep pushing? Listen,

376
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,120
I'm happy to be here, Dr. Oz. I truly

377
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,120
am. So, I'm working so hard. I'm working

378
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,639
probably harder now than I did for the

379
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,480
games cuz I'm not going for a gold

380
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,880
medal. I'm going for my life back. I'm

381
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,040
going to be able to walk some someday.

382
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,040
Knock on wood. So, I have to push it.

383
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,120
So, you brush your husband along for the

384
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,519
trip. Tom is joining us front row, a

385
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,200
professional athlete. You've challenged

386
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,399
yourself in the past just to be the best

387
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,920
you can be. It's a whole different level

388
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,120
to watch your wife have to take the

389
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,800
brunt of this. How'd you find the

390
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,720
strength to be there for her? You know,

391
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,560
it was tough. it. But it was one of

392
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,880
those things where I knew what she was

393
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,200
going through laying there on the on the

394
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,000
table and what she was facing ahead of

395
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,480
her that I just had to just keep calm

396
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,639
and and just kind of be the rock. What

397
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,959
about the offer to get married again or

398
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,639
find somebody else?

399
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,360
Yeah, she took that right back right

400
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
away once once she came out of surgery.

401
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,000
So, if I can share this to everybody, we

402
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,360
did speak over this summer and I was and

403
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
I was following all this the you know

404
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,160
the the tweets and the social media that

405
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,000
you're putting out which is you know

406
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,279
most of the information we were getting

407
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,639
and this is the part that amazed me.

408
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,680
This is your attitude. This is a little

409
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,880
tweet that she sent out after the

410
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,320
accident. How many of you would would

411
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,639
say this if you're lying on your back

412
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,720
having been a multi- gold medal winner

413
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,720
just thinking out loud now I will get

414
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,199
really good seats at Diamondbacks games

415
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,079
and other favorite sports teams.

416
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:27,440
Awesome. Bring in my own chair as well.

417
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,440
So I got my own chair. I got good

418
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,839
parking too, right? And how do you do

419
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,680
that? I I I just I sit here thinking,

420
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,079
"Oh my god, I'd be so bitter. I'd be so

421
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,360
angry. All this I was given so much."

422
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,959
Yes, you did things most of us could

423
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,720
never imagine doing. Walking away with

424
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,560
gold medals in different Olympic games.

425
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,120
But then it's all seemingly taken away

426
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,560
from you. Mhm. If you would have told me

427
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,839
after my first games this would have

428
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,839
happened happened to me, I wouldn't have

429
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,279
handled it well at all because at that

430
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,680
moment I really didn't have a life

431
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,839
outside of swimming. Right. So now I've

432
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,399
had the life experiences, you know, to

433
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,399
be able to look at this and say it's

434
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,680
okay. Well, that was the undaunted and

435
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,440
unbroken. Amy put her winning spirit to

436
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,120
work. She's been working seven hours of

437
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,480
physical therapy every day. And we have

438
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
this footage. If you don't mind,

439
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,600
describe what this is there. I mean, the

440
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,760
amount of work that I know it's taking.

441
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,279
This is you in the pool. Yeah. And it

442
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,959
was very different. Um, you know,

443
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,199
because here I'm trying to do what I

444
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,519
used to do in swimming. Um, but it was

445
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,959
very, very different. Here I am learning

446
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,680
how if I fall on the floor, which

447
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,320
happens a lot, how to get back up, get

448
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,880
back up into my chair. Um, worked very

449
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,800
tirously at that. And, you know, you

450
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,480
learn how to live your life. So, there's

451
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
a milestone I know you've been seeking

452
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,600
and you have a big announcement about

453
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,920
it. So, I'd love if you don't mind to

454
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,279
share the news with all of our viewers.

455
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,199
Okay. Well, we had um an exciting day.

456
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,079
Uh not too long ago, a couple months

457
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,360
ago, I got had this big contraption that

458
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,759
was just strapped on me and I actually

459
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,560
walked. You did? Oh, there you are.

460
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,720
There you are. I did. Look at that.

461
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,399
Right. It makes me so happy. No,

462
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,480
seriously, it shows the wonderful

463
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,399
ability of the human body to regenerate

464
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,759
itself. And I do personally believe

465
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,519
we're going to be able to get ahead of

466
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,639
spinal cord injuries and find ways

467
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,079
connecting these nerves. is one of the

468
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,720
great frontiers. Yes. But it's the

469
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,399
undaunting spirit of people overcoming

470
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
the challenges they face day in and day

471
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,600
out day out that makes it all

472
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,120
worthwhile. I guess it's unbelievable.

473
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,519
You're back doing swimming competitions

474
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,120
now. You're you're refereeing them now.

475
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,720
Yeah. I actually call them. So when you

476
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
watch them on TV, I'm the person going

477
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,199
and that stroke really shouldn't look

478
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,360
like that at all. So yeah. Yeah. There's

479
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,120
me and one of my partners, Jason Knap.

480
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,440
So yeah, I'm back at it. And here's the

481
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
thing, Dr. Oz. put that headset on and

482
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,720
when you hear me, my brain and my mouth

483
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
are not paralyzed. You would never know

484
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,639
that I couldn't walk. It was a great

485
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,320
honor to meet you. Congratulations.

486
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,440
Thank you. And I have something for you.

487
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,959
I do. I do. Listen, when I got injured,

488
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,560
people started something and we have

489
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,000
made a foundation and I want you to be a

490
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,920
part I want you to be a part of Amy's

491
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,399
army if you don't mind. I would

492
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:07,480
love Amy's an honorary member. Thank

493
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,480
you. Amen. We'll be right back. Right.

494

up on Monday.

514
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,720
I love learning about things that we

515
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,120
don't realize impact our health. So,

516
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,880
today I'm exploring how color can reveal

517
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,799
your true personality and what that

518
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,520
means for your health. It turns out your

519
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:18,160
personality color could be either red,

520
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,840
yellow, orange, or green. Here to help

521
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,520
find your personality color is an

522
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,520
innovator in the field of personality

523
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,840
behavior, Dr. Carol Whitberger. How are

524
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,760
you, Carol? I'm fine, thank you. So

525
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,039
color and psychology, how do you connect

526
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,480
them and how does that tell us much

527
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,320
about our health and our personality?

528
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,320
Color is a common language. We use it

529
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,240
all the time. Uh in the western culture,

530
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,200
it actually talks, we apply it to

531
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,000
behavior such as I'm red with anger or

532
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,160
I'm green with envy. So it's a very easy

533
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,600
uh way for us to look at personality.

534
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,360
All we got to do then is teach people

535
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,720
how to find their color. Dr. Ritberger

536
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,080
wants you to answer three simple

537
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,039
questions. It's multiple choice. Keep

538
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,240
track of your answers. Everyone in the

539
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,160
audience is going to do it. Everyone at

540
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,640
home do the same. First question. When

541
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,960
faced with a big project at home or at

542
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,320
work, you are a deadline driven while

543
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,919
you're watching the clock all the time.

544
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,840
B, you're worrying, spending most of

545
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,360
your time pretty anxious. C, you're

546
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,760
always scanning, looking for better

547
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,240
ideas. You got the best ideas for the

548
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,160
best concepts. You're happy then. D, you

549
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,520
make it a group effort. The more the

550
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,960
merrier. So, you have four choices. Pick

551
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,039
the one that applies to you. We all

552
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,200
clear on this. Okay. You pick your You

553
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,360
picked your letters already? All right.

554
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,520
Second question. When someone asks you

555
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,679
for a favor, you A want to know what

556
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,280
you're getting in return. B, you say,

557
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,440
"Yeah, sure." But you have second

558
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,200
thoughts right afterwards. C, you tell

559
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,200
them you're going to get back to them so

560
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,280
you can agree about maybe what you could

561
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,640
do together. And D, you agree and you go

562
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,200
full throttle and there's no turning

563
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,559
back. No changing your mind. All right,

564
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,600
that's remember your second letter. Now,

565
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,440
this the last question I'm going to ask

566
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,360
you. When you're stuck in traffic, A,

567
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,760
you honk your horn a lot. You got to get

568
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,600
home and you deserve to get home. B, you

569
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,320
never honk your horn. Why add to the

570
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,840
stress? C, you know all the shortcuts.

571
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,400
You're always finding new routes to get

572
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,480
home. And D, you dance along to the

573
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,600
radio, having a good time. All right,

574
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,360
you all got your numbers down, your

575
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,400
letters. You all clear on this. You know

576
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,160
what I am? Would you have to You

577
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,760
probably I do know what you are. What do

578
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,919
you think I am? I think you're a C. I

579
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,000
think you're a yellow. She's right. I'm

580
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,160
a yellow. I'm a prototypical yellow.

581
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,679
You're just a perfectionist.

582
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,880
All right. So, we're going to start with

583
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,120
the A's, though. I'm going to save

584
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,280
myself for later on. So, who Let me see

585
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,120
hands up. Who's all the A's out there?

586
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,799
There's got to be some A's. There's like

587
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,400
three A's over here. No one's

588
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,840
acknowledging it. All right, come on

589
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,919
over here. We're going to see what color

590
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,679
goes along with the A's. So, please

591
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,679
reveal the personality color, Carol. All

592
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,440
right, it is red. The red personality.

593
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,679
It's not unusual to not have a lot of

594
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,840
reds in the audience like this. That

595
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,919
personality is one that just get it done

596
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,000
people. They're competitive. They're

597
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,120
driven. They're deadline oriented. They

598
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,520
like to have control of their

599
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,760
environment. They like to just see that

600
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,600
everything gets done. No measurement on

601
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,520
effort. Bottom line. And what are the

602
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,919
health problems that A's typically have?

603
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Uh A's typically tend to hold the stress

604
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,559
and the tension in their lower back.

605
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,000
Maybe that's why I have so much back

606
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,919
pain in America. A lot of A's in the

607
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,960
country. We do a lot of what we call

608
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,559
type A's literally and we see red.

609
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,080
Absolutely. They see red. All right,

610
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,960
friends. Angelina Carol joining us to

611
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,320
help us now. Carol answered mostly B's

612
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,760
and Angelina answered mostly C's. Dr. Go

613
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,360
ahead and show the color that goes along

614
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,440
with the bees. It is orange. Orange. The

615
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,200
orange personality is the just let's get

616
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,039
it along people. They just they're

617
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,559
cooperative. They're kind. They're

618
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,039
generous. They always put other people's

619
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,640
needs before their own. Yep. Well, one

620
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,480
of the things with the orange is that

621
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,240
the way your brain works is you have to

622
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,240
make sense of things and it has to feel

623
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,320
right. So, it's like your brain is

624
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
always going back and forth and if you

625
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,159
don't have the time to do that, it shows

626
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,000
up in your lower stomach. Okay? And then

627
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,840
what you do is then it can uh cause you

628
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,600
to worry and then that changes the

629
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,320
chemistry of your body and dog gone they

630
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,559
end up with depression. Depression.

631
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,720
Angelina. Is that possible for Carol? I

632
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,080
don't think so. Actually, I was drawn to

633
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,919
Carol cuz she's so happy. So I don't

634
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Yeah, very happy people. But they do

635
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,440
worry. Do you worry? I do worry. Yeah,

636
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,000
most definitely. Yeah, they worry about

637
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,840
anything and everything. Yeah. Does that

638
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,919
sound right? I could see her worrying

639
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,760
about some things. Probably a little

640
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,640
bit. Let's Let's turn the tide here. Go.

641
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,080
Go into the seas over there. I'm going

642
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,760
to see what they think now. So, Angel,

643
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,840
it's your turn. Okay. You want over

644
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,840
there? Go ahead. Reveal the color to All

645
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,760
right. So, the question is for all these

646
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,600
seas out there, your color is yellow.

647
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,440
Yellow. I'm a yellow. You're a yellow.

648
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,520
You're a yellow. I'm a yellow. You are

649
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,120
great people. We get great people. We're

650
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,559
just wonderful people. That's one of our

651
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,880
qualities. We're not necessarily the

652
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,360
most humble. No. Yes. No. Take it. Take

653
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,640
it humbleness to a new low. Exactly.

654
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,640
Exactly. So, what's our personality

655
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,080
type? So what that says is that you like

656
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,360
to do things different. Kind of the

657
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,960
motivation is to build a different

658
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,679
mousetrap. Everything about you is

659
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,360
visionary, innovative, and never wanting

660
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,799
to be really boxed in so you can really

661
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,400
think about things. And so what are the

662
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,480
health problems Angelina and I are going

663
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,240
to have? Well, one of the things is we

664
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,320
actually hold the stress in our stomach

665
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,559
area. It's like we following that gut

666
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,919
instinct. And then what happens when we

667
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,600
don't do that? We get all this tension

668
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,600
and we actually are prone to tension

669
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,600
headaches. Yeah. And that's one of the

670
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,520
things that we end up with. It sounds

671
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,640
like it might be on target. Absolutely.

672
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,240
I hope that's helpful to the two of you.

673
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,720
Let me turn to the last color. D's. How

674
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,080
many D's are out there? Show hands. D's.

675
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,480
There are a number of D's. All right.

676
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,320
The D's are greens. That's correct. So,

677
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
what what does the green color mean?

678
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,799
Very happy people. They like everything

679
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,720
to be teamwork. They're dreamers. They

680
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,559
love to create. They love to see all the

681
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,400
possibilities and things. And they truly

682
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,840
believe that if you think you can do it,

683
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,120
you can do it even if it's the very

684
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,480
first time. And what are the health

685
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,679
problems they run into? One of the

686
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,120
things with greens when they get

687
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,600
stressed is they tend to hold their

688
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,360
breath. And when they hold their breath,

689
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
uh, then what happens is those shoulders

690
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,039
start creeping up. So, they have a lot

691
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,240
of neck and shoulder problems. Let me

692
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,600
see the greens again. Put your hands up

693
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,720
here. We got some here. Let me come over

694
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,720
here. I want to see how accurate this

695
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,760
is. Stand up if you don't mind. Does

696
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,440
that sound like you at all? What's your

697
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,440
first name? My name is Cara. Cara, did

698
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,520
that sound like you at all? That sounds

699
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,360
100% like me. 100%. Number one, I'm I'm

700
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,360
a fizzad teacher and a coach, so I'm

701
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,919
constantly encouraging my students and

702
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,720
motivating them. I'm always happy. Like

703
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,919
anyone who sees me, they're like,

704
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,080
"You're always so happy and so

705
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,679
energetic." So that definitely fits me.

Monday. Larry King is a television icon,

735
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,039
a true survivor. He had a major heart

736
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,799
attack, quintuple bypass surgery.

737
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,039
Neither stopped him from becoming one of

738
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,760
the great interviewers of our time. At

739
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,080
age 81, he's still going strong and has

740
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,799
what most will consider a controversial

741
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,080
plan to try and live forever. Please

742
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,080
welcome my friend Larry King.

[Applause]

748
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,120
I like the look here. You like this look

749
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,159
like

750
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,159
this. So that was always the

751
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,799
look. So when I was please, you know, I

752
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,720
would always be in the hospital late at

753
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,080
night, you know, trying to finish my,

754
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,760
you know, last case of rounds and I'd

755
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,200
watch you every evening. It was a very

756
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,440
formative experience for me. And you had

757
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,559
the the suspenders on all the time. I've

758
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,159
never worn suspenders on the show

759
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,840
before, but they actually have a health

760
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,679
benefit I've learned from getting your

761
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,200
posture fixed. Is that true? You're

762
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,360
kidding. No, I'm serious. I looked it

763
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,559
up. Is there any reasonable person who

764
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,159
would wear suspenders in this day and

765
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,840
age? And the argument is if you want to

766
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,120
remind yourself about a good posture, do

767
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,679
what Larry King does. I never thought of

768
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,400
it. I do it just cuz I lost a lot of

769
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,640
weight after my open heart surgery. And

770
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,799
it was suggested that I would look good

771
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,320
with braces. I used to wear You look

772
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,000
very good. There's one clue I could give

773
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,240
you, though. Please, please help me.

774
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,240
Don't wear a belt when you wear braces.

775
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,919
Yeah. What? This is a bad idea. I don't

776
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,159
know what I was thinking. Yeah. Much

777
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,159
better now.

778
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,960
Gone. Here, duck. Yeah. Surprise. All

779
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,240
right, let's get right to it. Uh, we've

780
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,799
been talking a little bit about this

781
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,000
idea you have of living forever. I'm

782
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,960
going to define it for everybody, but

783
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.

784
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,000
When I say living forever, this is not

785
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,640
sci-fi anymore. Now, there's the ability

786
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,159
to do cryopreservation to freeze your

787
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,799
body as you die. So, what is your hope?

788
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,480
I I'm I'm I was raised Jewish, but I

789
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,240
lost my religion a long time ago. So,

790
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm I'm an agnostic atheist. I don't

791
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,640
think you're going anywhere. All right.

792
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,559
So, I think when you die, that's it. And

793
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,480
I don't want it to be it. I want to be

794
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:36,720
around. So, I figure the only chance I

795
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,200
have is to be frozen. Yeah. And then if

796
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,799
they cure whatever I desire of, I come

797
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,440
back.

798
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,000
What's the thought? Oh, what is it? a

799
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,320
better thought than being in the ground,

800
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,400
being cremated. What would you like to

801
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,880
be educated a bit about what exactly

802
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,159
happens when they freeze you? Yeah, I

803
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
would like to know exactly what

804
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,640
happened. Y'all want to know that a

805
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,000
little bit? Come on

806
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,919
over. The reason I had a belt on was my

807
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
mic pack, but there okay. That's all

808
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,600
right. It looks okay. Just like this.

809
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,200
Oh, come over this side. It's better.

810
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,840
It's a better view for you. How do you

811
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,039
know about everything? I study. I study.

812
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,960
So, hold your suspenders. Should hold

813
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,480
yourself up just in case. So this is

814
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,080
what happens. Okay, so they just said

815
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,600
you're gone. They throw you in ice as

816
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,880
fast as they can. The cry pres

817
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,240
preservation starts immediately. They

818
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,799
start pumping on your chest with this

819
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,720
machine to circulate the blood. Then

820
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,480
they can put a breathing bag to give

821
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,000
oxygen to you at the same time. So now

822
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,679
they're basically doing what they would

823
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,120
do if you were still alive. The reason

824
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,640
they do this is as everything

825
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,880
circulating through, they now have time

826
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,840
to put a needle in your arm and give you

827
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,440
a medical grade antifreeze. This cold

828
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,679
solution is then pumped not just to your

829
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,159
arm, but into your chest. very low

830
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,480
temperature until you ultimately get to

831
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,000
a really really cold place where there's

832
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,200
no metabolism happening. The cells that

833
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,720
are there are still alive and they're

834
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,799
kept that way. Then they put you in this

835
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,039
big casket. It's a freezer basically.

836
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,640
They flip you upside down. They freeze

837
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,080
your body and they put you with three of

838
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,760
your best friends because you're going

839
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,159
to be stored in these containers for

840
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,679
some time. And then ultimately, as you

841
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,600
say, if there's a reason to unfreeze

842
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,440
you, we figure out how to unfreeze you.

843
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,640
Then you're unfrozen together with your

844
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
three colleagues there. What about the

845
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,720
story they cut your head off? So, you

846
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,919
can also just freeze your head. That's

847
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,399
cheaper, by the way, if you're

848
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,240
interested. Yeah. They cut your head off

849
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,080
and then they can put that fluid right

850
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
into your head. Although, I got to say,

851
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,480
I'd preserve the whole body. If you're

852
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
going to do it, do it right. I'll do it

853
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,880
right. I'd preserve the whole body. But

854
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,080
then, how do they know in in in that

855
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,039
tunnel there, that guy died of this?

856
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,799
Well, they're going to have all the

857
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,240
record. They got to keep the record. But

858
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,000
as a physician, the part that's

859
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,760
intriguing is keeping enough of your

860
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,640
cells alive that one day they could make

861
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,000
a bionic version of you. That's sort of

862
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,279
the hope, right? That's why they

863
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,240
preserve just a head. They figure

864
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,760
they'll get a different body. That

865
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,159
body's done. They'll put a different

866
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,000
head on a machine and you'll have

867
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,799
awareness. Now, my wife, whose picture

868
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,320
you have up, I see that. Yes. Uh she

869
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,480
said to me, "You come back in 200 years,

870
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,279
you won't know anybody." So, I said,

871
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,279
"I'll make new friends."

872
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,039
Well, actually, what is the first thing

873
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,720
that you would do? The very first thing

874
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,840
you would do if they were to all of a

875
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,520
sudden unfreeze you and you had

876
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,480
awareness that you were back in life 200

877
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,240
years from now. Oh, I' I'd be asking

878
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,200
questions. Who's who's around? What are

879
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,919
they can you transport uh can you go to

880
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:28,320
the moon? What was science

881
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:31,200
fiction 40 years ago is fact. For

882
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,679
example, I had bypass surgery. There was

883
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,720
a book in

884
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:38,720
1947 in which a doctor put a person on a

885
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,679
heart lung machine. It was science

886
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,960
fiction. It was they did bypass and they

887
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,120
wrote about this and people said it's

888
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,080
nuts. Yep. Wasn't done till for 10 more

889
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,520
years and we never thought it was

890
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,840
possible. In fact, doctors would get

891
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,520
fired if they exposed the heart because

892
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,080
no one had ever survived. They've been

893
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,600
seeing the heart was a lethal injury.

894
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,880
But your heart was seen. It was seen

895
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,720
when they did the bypass surgery you

896
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,440
discussed. You went from being a fairly

897
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,960
sickly person in 1987, right, with when

898
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,960
you had the operation, smoking and the

899
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,559
like. So, here you are all these years

900
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,679
later, healthier than you've ever been.

901
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,039
How did you do that? How did you make

902
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,799
that change? Well, I got first I stopped

903
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,080
smoking immediately and I thought I'd

904
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,720
never stop smoking. I was a threeack a

905
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,279
day smoker. A doctor told me, a

906
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,919
psychiatrist, a friend of mine said what

907
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,640
I became

908
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:29,679
was scared straight. Yeah. that I still

909
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,960
wanted a cigarette, but that emergency

910
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,960
room brought me back. I never smoked

911
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,519
again. Well, kudos to you because a lot

912
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,519
of folks don't hear that much. This show

913
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,279
at its very core is about getting people

914
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,600
to realize they control their I watch

915
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,000
you all the time. I'm amazed at you

916
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,000
because I never saw a guy. You know

917
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,080
about everything.

918
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,919
God knows. The man knows everything.

919
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,279
Well, talk about an inquisitive person.

920
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,960
You're a curious fellow. You're always

921
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,799
moving around, keeping active. In fact,

922
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,640
in your own neighborhood, you know, he's

923
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,399
walking going around in LA and you got

924
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,080
caught by paparazzi recently. If you

925
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,159
could tell this story, I would never

926
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,320
considered this possibility, but Larry

927
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,840
King pow-wowing with Justin Bieber. What

928
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,120
is going on here? This is a P. Look at

929
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,120
this picture. Look at this. He's

930
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,200
assaulting you. He like a driveby. It's

931
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,960
like a fan. First of all, cars are

932
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,320
honking. Other people are yelling.

933
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,559
People are screaming Justin Bieber.

934
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,799
Larry kid got it almost. It was wild. I

935
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,640
love it. It was crazy. Now, you must

936
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,399
your kids must beautiful wife, as you

937
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,240
mentioned already. gone. Uh, and two

938
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,880
wonderful children. They must be the big

939
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,880
fans, I gather. They keep you young, and

940
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,039
having a young wife keeps you young. But

941
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,440
you know what I do? No, this the truth.

942
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,840
You saw the

943
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,279
picture. You see that picture of her,

944
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,360
when you have someone who looks like

945
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,600
that and I look like I look and there's

946
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,919
obviously an age difference, right? I

947
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,240
mean, come on. So, I know what people

948
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,640
are thinking when they see us. So, I

949
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,640
always say the same thing. If she dies,

950
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,799
she dies.

951
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,080
Larry King, you'll be here all week. Be

952
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,080

955
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,040
back. Love

956
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,399
that. Thank you very

957

[Music]

972
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,080
All right, let me do a little experiment

973
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,480
with the audience. I want you, anyone

974
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,279
who is stressed, stand up right now. Oh,

975
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,039
yes. We got a lot of Hallelujah here.

976
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,279
Stand up. If you have no energy, stand

977
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,960
up. Got a couple stragglers here. Okay.

978
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,440
If you're having any pain in your life,

979
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,880
stand up. We got just about everybody

980
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,159
here. Yeah, actually, we did literally

981
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,080
get everybody. All right. I just gave

982
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,200
you three good reasons to try Chiang.

983
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,800
So, go ahead and sit down, get

984
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,720
comfortable. Nothing bad's happening to

985
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,639
you. Kung Fu master and Chiang expert

986
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,399
Carl Roma is here. He's going to show us

987
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,159
how these ancient Chinese remedies

988
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,760
really work. How are you? Good. How are

989
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,440
you? So, explain to everybody what

990
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,440
Chiang is. Why should they be excited

991
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,280
about if they stood just now? Chiang is

992
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,919
a practice that has been used in Chinese

993
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,839
medicine for centuries. Includes breath,

994
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,599
movement, and mental imagery to move the

995
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,119
body's energy to prevent disease. So,

996
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,200
how does it heal you if you actually

997
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,359
already have a problem? Well, cheese

998
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,040
energy gung is work. So, chiong is using

999
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,480
the body's natural energy to promote

1000
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,079
healing. You know, the Chinese believe

1001
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,800
that all sickness in the body is caused

1002
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,560
when chi or energy is blocked. Western

1003
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,919
research is just catching on to this.

1004
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,280
Here's why I trust Carl. He taught my

1005
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,800
wife how to do these martial arts

1006
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,240
techniques on me. It's terrible. It's a

1007
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,760
very dangerous place when they go home.

1008
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,599
It's like getting attacked by KO. All

1009
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,960
right. This stuff is so powerful that

1010
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,399
it's actually been taught all around the

1011
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,680
country now. Major medical centers

1012
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,119
teaching Chiang. And of course, it's

1013
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,800
used by, you know, more than a billion

1014
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,800
people in China. So, we got six audience

1015
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,920
members to help us out today. And we're

1016
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,839
going to get to all these different

1017
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,599
causes. Welcome everybody. I hope you're

1018
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,800
nervous. I am. We're going to do a bunch

1019
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,000
of Chiang moves. They're going to work

1020
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,359
for some of the most common ailments we

1021
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,599
have in America. The first reason to

1022
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,000
chai Chiang is stress relief. And the

1023
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,520
first move is called cooling the fire of

1024
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,760
the heart. How does this help to reduce

1025
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,680
stress? Well, it calms the mind and

1026
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,280
soothes the heart. The heart in Chinese

1027
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,800
medicine is connected to the mind. So,

1028
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,000
this is great for stress reduction. All

1029
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,440
right. Do you want to show us? Yeah,

1030
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,160
absolutely. Work along with us. So, what

1031
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,839
we're going to do is we're going to

1032
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,480
start with our feet shoulderwidth apart,

1033
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,079
knees slightly bent. Okay. Back is nice

1034
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,440
and straight. Good. Posture is very

1035
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,280
important. And we're going to breathe

1036
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,640
deep diaphragmic breaths. And we're

1037
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,480
going to bring our hands out to the

1038
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,599
side. And you want your palms up. I'm

1039
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,200
just going to slide over a little bit.

1040
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,680
Raise your hands overhead. Take a deep

1041
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,000
breath in. Exhale. And slowly let those

1042
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,359
hands fall. Good. Now, it's really

1043
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,560
important to keep the tongue in the roof

1044
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,079
of the mouth and teeth together. And

1045
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,800
breathe through the nose. All right.

1046
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,800
Here we go. I kind of

1047
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,720
inhale and exhale. Nice and slow. Don't

1048
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,880
let those hands touch. Keep those hands

1049
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,119
apart. Bring them right down. That's it.

1050
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,280
Good job, Bashar. One more.

1051
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:12,480
Inhale and

1052
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,640
exhale. You can feel how relaxing that

1053
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,480
is. That's nice, isn't it? You keep your

1054
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,680
tongues up to to the roof of your mouth.

1055
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,520
They weren't able to talk that way. All

1056
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,359
right. Next, we're going to boost your

1057
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,680
energy with Chiang. And this is a move

1058
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,520
called bouncing the ball. How do you

1059
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,680
bounce the ball to boost your energy?

1060
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,280
Well, in Chinese medicine, the kidneys

1061
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,560
are in charge of our energy. So, we

1062
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,400
don't want our energy to be too high or

1063
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,640
too low. We want our energy to be even.

1064
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,920
The best time to do this is late in the

1065
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,760
afternoon when you have that afternoon

1066
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,599
slump and you need a pickme up or if you

1067
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,880
suffer from insomnia and you can't sleep

1068
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,560
at night. It's a great way to bring your

1069
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,320
energy down so you can relax. So it

1070
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,200
balances us. Balances. Show us the move.

1071
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,720
All right. So here's what we're going to

1072
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,480
do. Again, starting from the same

1073
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,240
starting position. Very simple. We're

1074
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,520
going to slide our foot in. As we slide

1075
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,680
our foot in, we're going to raise the

1076
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,400
opposite hand. That's it. And then bring

1077
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,400
your foot down and slide the other side.

1078
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Excellent. Move from side to side. Deep

1079
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,320
breath in. Exhale as you come up. And

1080
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,480
you feel that nice gentle rocking

1081
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,839
movement. Very soothing, isn't it? Your

1082
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,200
hands are parallel like that, not Yes.

1083
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,720
You want them parallel to the ground.

1084
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,640
And you want your standing legs slightly

1085
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,880
bent. You also want to find one point

1086
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,800
with your eyes to focus on. That'll help

1087
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,839
you to keep your balance. I'm focused on

1088
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,680
you. All right. Anyone falling back

1089
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,680
there? No fallers. It's actually once

1090
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,040
you get into the rhythm, it's it's it's

1091
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,320
a little sleeker than you think. Yeah.

1092
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,760
All right. Last thing you guys were all

1093
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,480
talking about was pain. So if you want

1094
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,720
to reduce pain, there's a move in Chiang

1095
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,480
called castingqing chi from side to

1096
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,320
side. So how does this cleanse the body

1097
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,920
and reduce pain? At least in the Chinese

1098
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,760
mindset. When there's pain and

1099
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,000
inflammation in the body, that's because

1100
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,599
there's a buildup of toxins. This

1101
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,520
exercise works on the liver. And the

1102
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,520
liver's job is to clear, purify, and

1103
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,280
remove those toxins to ease the pain.

1104
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,440
Okay. Okay. So this is real simple and

1105
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,880
fun, too. All right. So pretend we're

1106
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,160
splashing water on each other. Guy's a

1107
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,839
world champion martial artist, by the

1108
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,480
way. So, when he says it's going to be

1109
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,640
fun, I get I get nervous. Anyway, keep

1110
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,599
our knees bent. Okay, back nice and

1111
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,880
straight again. And I want you to

1112
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,560
pretend you had a bucket of water in

1113
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,160
your hand. And I want you to just kind

1114
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,839
of lean over to the side. And as you do

1115
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,240
it, keep your feet flat and just kind of

1116
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,760
exhale and let it go. And then inhale

1117
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,560
back to center and let it go to the

1118
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,760
other side. Inhale and exhale. And you

1119
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,079
can feel that pain leaving your body.

1120
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,920
Right, Dr. Oz? I was feeling okay

1121
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,040
before. Now, now my back hurts. All

1122
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,320
right, so we got to put them all

1123
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,680
together. Nice and slow. How would you

1124
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,839
do it all together? All together. So,

1125
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,760
we're going to do one of each. Okay. So,

1126
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,599
first, ready? Inhale. Cooling the fire

1127
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,599
of the

1128
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,599
heart.

1129
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,560
Exhale. Right from here, we're going to

1130
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,880
slide our leg in and raise the hand.

1131
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,880
Opposite hand, opposite leg. Inhale and

1132
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,839
exhale. And then bring it down. Ready?

1133
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,800
Hands in front and off to the side. So,

1134
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,560
this is what they're doing in the

1135
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,960
streets of China all the time. You see

1136
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,320
older folks doing this all day long,

1137
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,000
actually in the morning usually. And

1138
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,680
it's so gentle. Anybody can do it. You

1139
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,280
can do it anywhere at any time and start

1140
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,040
reaping the benefits of it. You can get

1141
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,960
all of Carl's wonderful moves. They're

1142
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,320
on dr.com. Just, you know, look on

1143
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,140
Chong, you'll find it. We'll be right

1144
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,920
back.

1156
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,720

1157
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,810

1160
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,440
Monday. Now it's time for in case you

1161
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,400
missed it, I got a special treat at the

1162
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,320
end that you're not going to want to

1163
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,480
miss. But first, incredible news today.

1164
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,960
Talk show legend Larry King has a plan

1165
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,599
to cryopreserve. That means freeze his

1166
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,200
body as he dies or after he dies. Right

1167
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,240
afterwards. Ever wonder how this works?

1168
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,280
Well, I showed it to him. I'm going to

1169
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,440
show it to you. It's not science

1170
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,960
fiction. Cryopreservation starts the

1171
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,119
moment that you pass away. They immerse

1172
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,280
you in ice to try to preserve the cells.

1173
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,680
And this vice bath is augmented by

1174
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,440
pumping into your body medical grade

1175
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,960
antifreeze. Your blood's removed. It's

1176
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,640
antifreeze. Allows the body to be

1177
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,480
preserved. Keeps the cells alive. The

1178
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,880
body's then put in a sack and in in a

1179
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,560
box in a and that is basically put into

1180
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,839
a freezer, really really cold freezer

1181
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,359
with three close friends now because you

1182
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,119
can be there for a while. But here's the

1183
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,880
catch, my friends. Science has not

1184
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,000
actually figured out how to unfreeze

1185
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,200
people yet. You know, we know how to

1186
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,200
freeze them. We just can't unfreeze

1187
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,599
them. So, if one day this comes in

1188
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,119
handy, it'll be quite a bit of time in

1189
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,960
the future. But you never know. Lari

1190
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,640
made pretty good arguments about how the

1191
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,160
world changes so fast that you can't

1192
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,760
keep up unless you do things like this.

1193
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,440
All right. Now, I want to welcome a very

1194
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,640
special guest on the show today. Her

1195
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,560
name is Marne. Marne the dog. She's

1196
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,480
what's called Insta famous. She has

1197
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,720
wiggled her way into the hearts of over

1198
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,800
1 million people on Instagram and

1199
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,240
Twitter. And it's easy to see why. Come

1200
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,240
on out. Marty is the

1201
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,400
[Applause]

1202
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,000
[Music]

1203
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,599
dog. What I love about Marty, at the

1204
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,280
first glance, she doesn't look so

1205
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,880
perfect, does she? She sort of winding.

1206
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,960
She actually has an illness that makes

1207
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,960
her head and that causes her tongue

1208
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,480
to hang out. But I think that makes her

1209
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,599
really cute cuz there's actually nothing

1210
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,800
wrong with her. She's so cute. And look

1211
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,760
at this. I look at this. Come on. That

1212
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,280
is How are you? Hi. Nice to meet you.

1213
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,359
She's always turning. I guess she goes

1214
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,040
to her left, right? Only to the left.

1215
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,079
Never to the right. True. And why is

1216
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,760
that? Um I I'm not sure, but that's the

1217
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,599
way she's comfortable walking. And so

1218
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,119
that's cool with me.

1219
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,200
What is it that made you want to adopt

1220
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,800
her? I mean, this is so cute. Well, I I

1221
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,880
was looking to adopt a dog. I found her

1222
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,520
on petfinder.com, which is a website to

1223
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,079
adopt homeless animals. But she turned

1224
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,240
out to be the most amazing dog. Yeah.

1225
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,000
Amazing in a lot of ways. Now, she also

1226
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,040
adopted Marty knowing that she was a

1227
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,280
senior dog. I did. Yeah. Um, we don't do

1228
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,760
a lot of that in America. Well, they're

1229
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,520
so grateful when Yeah, absolutely. Here,

1230
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,440
you can just hold her like a baby. She

1231
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,839
likes to be held that way. I love this.

1232
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,240
This is the cutest. Can you see this?

1233
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,240
