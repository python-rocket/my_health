of Atlanta, you know it's all about the

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,800
Claudia Jordan, fits right into the mix.

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,000
They've been taking on Atlanta housewife

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,760
matriarch Nene Leaks. A lot of activity.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
Claudia's fellow housewives aren't the

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,160
only things irritating her. She recently

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,320
revealed a medical condition, multiple

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,480
corns on her feet that she's lived with

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
for years. Wait till you see them. And

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,010

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:06,090

[Applause]

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,680
Thank you, boy. Come have a seat. Oh my

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
god. You're like, "Wait till you see

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,680
them." We We are going to look at him in

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,040
a second. I I got to ask. I mean, I It

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
gets pretty heated on the set there.

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,000
What What irritates you more, your

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,920
relationship with fellow housewife Nene

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,520
Leaks or the corns? My corns are

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,880
extremely annoying, but they're nowhere

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,880
near as obnoxious as Nene Leaks. I can

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,840
cover my corns up. Yes, you can. And

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,360
they don't talk back. So So Nid's been

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,200
on the show. You guys don't get along

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
for personality reasons or it's just,

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
you know, we work together before. She

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
asked me to like um take over for a job

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,200
that she couldn't do one time years ago

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
and she was following me on Twitter for

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
years. So I didn't think we had an

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,360
issue. So when I got there, I was kind

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,960
of surprised that she kind of was acting

53
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,119
like that. But I know people put on TV.

54
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,880
They had to get their moment. All right,

55
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,000
let's talk about your corns. First of

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,439
all, I am curious that you're being

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
public about them. Have they been a

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,320
long-standing issue and why are you

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,840
talking about them now? Um, I've had

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,520
issues since I was in college. I ran

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,119
track and um I was all-American in track

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,959
and field and when we would comply. Good

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,520
for you. I was a sprinter, but I would

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,879
wear track spikes that were like a size

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,480
too small because I felt like I gripped

66
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,680
the track better, but when I took my

67
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,280
shoes off, my feet would be irritated

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
and my toes would kind of be like this.

69
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,040
Then I became a model and deal or no

70
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,480
deal. And I like, you know, 19 hour days

71
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,720
in heels. And a lot of times it'd be

72
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,120
brand new shoes. They maybe weren't the

73
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,680
best fitting shoes. So a lot of us have

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
feet kind of like dancers. So mine just

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,640
I mean the skin on my feet. They're just

76
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,800
really sensitive. And it's tough

77
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
sometimes when you're dating, especially

78
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,879
now, ever since the movie Boomerang came

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,720
out, nobody cared about feet until Eddie

80
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,879
Murphy made it a big deal. And now it's

81
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,800
like, let me see if you I'm like, let me

82
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,519
keep my socks on. Well, to to paraphrase

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,840
Eddie Murphy, can I see your feet? Oh,

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,400
you can. Don't judge me. Don't judge.

85
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,040
So, I've got a corn cam. A special corn

86
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,640
cam that I got you.

87
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,720
I I don't want the audience to miss any

88
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,800
part of this. No. A corn. You got to Can

89
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,319
you like like make it like a soft focus

90
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,200
and maybe like dim the lights a little

91
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,959
bit, a romantic ambiance? It's the one

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,239
thing I'm extremely insecure about. So,

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,599
this is like I'm doing this for the

94
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,480
sisters out there, the women out there

95
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,959
who have bad feet. Yeah.

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,640
I am your mascot.

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,760
It is a brave thing to do because a lot

98
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,840
of women would never be caught without

99
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,519
their shoes on. But you'll say that as I

100
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,400
take my foot my shoe off. Well, I think

101
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,760
first of all, you're doing the right

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
thing. And of course, I can go through

103
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,120
this entire audience do the exact same

104
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,640
thing. So, let's start with yours with

105
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,680
your little cords. Okay. They're a

106
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,519
natural. It's like Cinderella. All

107
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,360
right. So, give me so. Well, I'm just

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,879
looking. But don't wiggle all the time.

109
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,200
Wiggle I don't want you to focus in on

110
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,879
them. Well, here. So, just a couple

111
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,000
things on corns. Okay. Uh they're

112
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
obviously they're adaptive. They're

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,799
thick, hardened layers. They are. Look

114
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,080
at that one in the end. Oh, is that the

115
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,840
one you put without the top? That's the

116
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,280
big one. Yeah, that Oh, yeah. That's

117
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,560
pretty. It's like a little pearl stuck

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,000
in there. Don't judge me.

119
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,760
So, here's the thing. The These are

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,280
actually very adaptive. They form on

121
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,720
joints that are being rubbed on against

122
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
friction, pressure, as you know, running

123
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,599
in those shoes with them. Um, not

124
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,840
wearing socks does this. Do you wear

125
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,040
socks much? No. Yeah. Because socks will

126
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
provide a little bit of cushioning for

127
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
that. Um, and then the other thing is,

128
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,879
of course, if you have hammer toes or if

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,720
you have bunions, you don't have a

130
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
bunion. Nope. Um, but this is a little

131
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,799
bit of a hammer tail. Probably from

132
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,479
being in those shoes for a lot of times.

133
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,400
If it pushes up like that and as it

134
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,079
pushes up like that, it'll start to So

135
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,960
my toes are deformed now because of the

136
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,639
years of abuse. Years of abuse, which

137
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,919
you know, sort of predictable, but the

138
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,440
good news is that things we can do about

139
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,960
it. What have you, First of all, how

140
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,800
long you had them? Since college. Since

141
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,400
college. So that was quite a while ago

142
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,639
because I'm 41 years old now. So it's

143
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,160
been a while. So, um I uh that's when

144
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,919
they first started and there was a time

145
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
where I would wear flats and they got a

146
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,960
little bit better and I would get

147
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
pedicures and they looked, you know,

148
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,320
presentable somewhat, but then back in

149
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,400
the heels and I will tell you the

150
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,160
expensive shoes were way more damaging

151
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,120
on my feet. They were they were and I

152
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
just don't understand how they can

153
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,680
justify the price of some of these shoes

154
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,960
if they're going to cause this kind of

155
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
damage. So, I look at these shoes here.

156
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
This look like like a chain. Is that is

157
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
a chain. All right. So, you have these

158
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,440
high heels which is what you normally

159
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,520
wear. I usually wear higher ones in

160
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,160
those. Higher than this? Yeah. like

161
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,680
stilts, right? And when is it is there a

162
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
problem with pain or is it the cosmetic

163
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,880
aspect of the corns that bother you? The

164
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,199
problem is well it doesn't hurt. My feet

165
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,600
don't my corns do not hurt. They're just

166
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
extremely hideous. And now, you know,

167
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,479
being on such a big show or just being

168
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,240
in the business, like when you go to red

169
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,080
carpet, you guys, the photographers,

170
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,440
they're so sneaky. They'll put the

171
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,800
camera on your toes and you think you're

172
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,560
you're looking at your face and you're

173
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,840
just doing all this and they got the

174
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
camera on your toes and it ends up on

175
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,759
this weird website where they're like

176
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,680
celebrity toes that are jacked up.

177
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
You're like, I'm thinking you looking at

178
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,440
my smile. Oh, you got a closeup of my

179
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,320
feet. And it's humiliating. So, I just

180
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,080
figured, you know what? I'm going to be

181
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,000
on the show. I mean, I rather take

182
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,840
ownership of my flaws myself instead of

183
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,960
someone else pointing them out. And why

184
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,720
not? Why not? Absolutely. You go. And

185
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,000
it's not like it's not like I did

186
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,039
anything wrong. I mean, this is

187
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,199
something that happens when you wear

188
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,240
certain type of shoes. And I since it's

189
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,759
happened my inbox on Facebook and on

190
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,840
Instagram I got so many people send me

191
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,440
pictures of their feet that are just as

192
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
bad if not worse and they're like thank

193
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,319
you for you know being brave because

194
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,400
I've been embarrassed and I don't know

195
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,960
what to do and so you know if it helps

196
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,840
people kind of deal with it and you know

197
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
make them feel a little bit more

198
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
comfortable like if she can do it I can

199
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
do it then so be it. You've become the

200
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
corn queen and I'm proud of you. Come on

201
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,240
over. What what have doctors told you

202
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,919
about this in the past here you here

203
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,400
I'll still you just lean on me. I'll

204
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,840
hobble this way. Go hop. You got me?

205
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,199
Yeah. Gotcha. Go. How about like that?

206
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,720
All right. So, have doctors try to do

207
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,560
much for these things? Okay. I went to

208
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,919
one doctor and I went to two doctors and

209
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,199
one was like much like yourself. She

210
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,479
said, "Listen, if it's not in pain, I

211
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,400
really couldn't justify doing surgery.

212
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,600
It's a cosmetic thing." And then another

213
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
doctor that just really wanted to take

214
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,479
my money said, "You know what? I could

215
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
do it for like 45,500. I just got to cut

216
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,639
the tendon and then you'll be okay." And

217
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,560
like I'm like, "Wait, wait, wait, hold

218
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,759
up. It sounded very medieval." And he

219
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
said he want to cut the tendon so the

220
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,160
toes will lay flat or remove part of the

221
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
joint. And I'm thinking I I still want

222
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
to be able to run. I still want to be

223
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,360
able to, you know, wear heels and I

224
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,919
don't think like I'm like, "Okay, am I

225
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
hurting my body long term for a cosmetic

226
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,360
issue? I don't want to do that."

227
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,520
Indications for foot surgery are pain,

228
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,440
pain, and more pain. Do not touch those

229
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
feet with with a scalpel unless you've

230
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,160
got pain. Now, that stated, I've got a

231
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,440
little home remedy for you that could

232
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,120
help you out, okay, that a lot of our

233
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,479
viewers, you know about the salicylic

234
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,840
acid passes, right? But this is

235
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,960
something different. So, this is a

236
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,400
special foot bath. Put your foot in

237
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,400
there. Enjoy yourself. Get comfortable

238
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,440
in there. Now, in that foot bath, and I

239
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
want everyone at home can do this as

240
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,599
well. Is that like hydrochloric acid?

241
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,199
It's an acid, but not hydrochloric acid.

242
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,280
Very gentle acid. It's apple cider

243
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,280
vinegar, which is a bit acidic. You'll

244
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,680
like the smell, right? And that actually

245
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,440
softens up the skin. So, 15 minutes

246
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,720
after this, go ahead and put your feet

247
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,759
up on here. Would you recommend, you

248
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,199
know, when you go to the nail shop, they

249
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,120
want to like file stuff down and cut

250
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,360
stuff. Is that dangerous? Um, if they do

251
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,440
it gently, I don't like to file with

252
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,880
anything sharp. I like pumones, which I

253
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,880
think are fine. Okay. In fact, after you

254
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,800
do this, you take a pumone, you can

255
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,840
gently rub it like that. Okay. Again,

256
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
you can't feel it, but when you begin to

257
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,319
feel it, it means you've gone deep

258
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,599
enough. And then here's the big thing.

259
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,120
See, I've roughed that up a little bit.

260
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,319
My corn cam's gone, but you can sort of

261
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
see that everybody. That's fine. We can

262
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
leave that over there. Okay. So, then

263
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,960
you're going to take a little castor

264
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,759
oil. Here's the magic solution. A little

265
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,160
castor oil. Just dab it on there and let

266
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,560
that soak. And over about 10 days,

267
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,919
you'll see that get softer and softer.

268
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,960
But I got to say something to you. Yeah.

269
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,080
And I think you're a smart woman.

270
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,599
Obviously, you know this already. If you

271
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,800
keep wearing those high heel shoes that

272
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,400
you're wearing, you're never going to be

273
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,840
able to get into a situation where these

274
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,759
things can heal themselves because this

275
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,560
is a scar protecting you. So, I want you

276
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,840
to try wearing flat shoes. But I realize

277
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,319
that you don't like wearing flat shoes

278
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,840
cuz you don't like seeing those corns.

279
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,280
When I was living in New York, I wore

280
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,639
flat shoes like every day pretty much

281
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,599
for like nine months. I rarely wore

282
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,959
heels. I gave them a little bit of a

283
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,399
rest. But then back in Atlanta, I really

284
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,919
have to be glam all the time. So, back

285
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,200
into the high heels, I went I made

286
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,519
something very special for you. You

287
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,120
have? I have corn coverups for the first

288
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,880
time ever. And they're especially for

289
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,880
you because Mimi leaks is on the corn

290
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,560
cover up.

291
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,640
So you just put these on like this

292
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,080
and you're basically I'm going to send a

293
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,480
few of these extra home with you like

294
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,120
that.

295
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,839
These all the ones you need from me. So

296
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
take those back. This is the Nini Leaks

297
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
foot appearance and give us extra ones

298
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
to her. I have a whole year supply

299
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,480
there. You'll enjoy them. I love them.

300
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,920
Thank you. It was really a pleasure. You

301
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320

Hollywood's biggest health headlines and

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,200
want to get the inside scoop from a

328
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
panel of top celebrity experts. Alicia

329
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,120
Corals is here from ENews, a

330
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,440
correspondent there. Caitlyn Becker

331
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,959
back. She's a host of HPO Live and of

332
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,200
course AJ Callie, my good friend, is a

333
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,880
correspondent for Extra.

334
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,160
He's on his best behavior today. Let's

335
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,920
get right to it. First, the story that

336
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,279
everyone's talking about, Robert Durst.

337
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
Man, I got to say before you get into

338
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,880
the background here, what I'm most

339
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,560
interested in is why he agreed to do the

340
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
documentary in the first place. So AJ,

341
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,000
bring us up to date. Okay, so there was

342
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,160
a fictional movie about himself. He saw

343
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,600
it. He called the producer, said that he

344
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,959
it would be a good idea to do an

345
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
interview. He decided to do this

346
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,440
interview and went into the restroom,

347
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
still miked up, and kind of was talking

348
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,600
to himself and confessed. There's a

349
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,440
fascinating article in the Washington

350
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,200
Post where it breaks down why he would

351
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,440
agree to do this interview. His lawyer

352
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,600
said, "Do not do this. I'm not advising

353
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,160
it. Don't do it. This is a guy that has

354
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,680
allegedly murdered three people. He's

355
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,040
saying stay away from it. But then it

356
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,279
breaks down his psyche. It says he's a

357
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,200
narcissist and also people want star

358
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,720
power. So even the fact that, you know,

359
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
he knows he's probably guilty. He just

360
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,399
couldn't stay away from that camera. Why

361
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,680
wouldn't he do it? Why wouldn't he do

362
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,680
it? He's in the last chapter of his

363
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,040
life. He's gotten essentially gotten

364
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,200
away with murder. He admitted on the

365
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,000
stand to dismembering the body of a

366
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,240
human being and walked. Why wouldn't he

367
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,399
do it at this point? He's basically

368
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,160
untouchable. So, he's he's clearly a

369
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,760
sociopath. But then, if you think about

370
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,440
sociopaths, what is it that and by the

371
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,800
way, people who kill people like the way

372
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
he probably did? Here are some

373
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,320
characteristics. Inappropriate

374
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,839
self-esteem. So, he's being told he's

375
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,279
fantastic. It's inflated, but it's not

376
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,040
true. He knows it's not true. He can't

377
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,600
deal with that. A lack of empathy, a

378
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,519
lack of sense of of worthiness. And so,

379
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
then he gets jealous and almost angry. I

380
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,240
think that he's not getting the credit

381
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
for getting away with these murders.

382
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
That's exactly what the article said.

383
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
There's no way he should have done that.

384
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,279
And during the alleged sort of

385
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,720
confession, I don't know if he's

386
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,640
confessing or not. The audio is picking

387
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,920
him up in the in the restroom. And it

388
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,519
sounds like he's having one half of a

389
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,360
phone conversation. He's posing

390
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,600
questions. He's answering questions that

391
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
haven't been asked. It sounds like he's

392
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
talking to someone that we don't hear.

393
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,480
Yeah. Okay. They move on to the

394
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,399
designers Dolce and Gabbana. They are

395
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,360
under fire for comments about babies

396
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,639
born IVF, which I was sort of surprised

397
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,240
by. Agent, what were the comments? The

398
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,399
comments were they they called them

399
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,079
synthetic babies. And he also said that

400
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,480
they don't feel that gays should be able

401
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,000
to adopt which infuriated so many

402
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,279
celebrities including Elton John and

403
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,760
they called out for a boycott against

404
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,279
Dolce and Gabbana. Yeah post here you

405
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,440
can see says how dare you refer to my

406
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,040
beautiful children as synthetic. That's

407
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,880
the actual word they use. And just

408
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,320
before we get into the discussion Doian

409
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,160
Gabbana stood by their statements. They

410
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
added we oppose gay adoptions. Now

411
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,600
they're gay of course. They oppose gay

412
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,279
adoptions. The only family is a

413
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,480
traditional one. I should emphasize that

414
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,639
one in 10 women have trouble getting

415
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
pregnant. 2% of all babies born now are

416
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,320
IVF. So what gives? There's this is

417
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,560
infuriating on so many levels. They were

418
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,040
a couple for 23 years. At one point they

419
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,320
wanted to have their own family. And um

420
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
you know they made these comments saying

421
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
that they grew up in love in a

422
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,440
traditional family. A family is what you

423
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,880
make it. You can have a a mother parent

424
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,639
and a father parent and not be the best

425
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,760
home. It's what you make it. So I'm

426
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,279
proud of all these celebrities for

427
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,880
standing up. I just interviewed Andy

428
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,839
Cohen who's selling his Dolchen Gabbana

429
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,079
stuff for charity.

430
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,639
Kayla, I think the the crazy part is is

431
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,200
they gave a second interview to CNN just

432
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,040
doing the worst job backpedaling. It was

433
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,240
a it was terrible, which they

434
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,560
essentially just went out there and

435
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,639
said, "We we you know what? We love

436
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,399
everyone. Everybody's fine. We love

437
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
everyone. This boycott is a terrible

438
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,639
idea." You know, you can see what

439
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,639
they're doing. They on one hand said,

440
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,160
you know, these are our views and and we

441
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,160
love everyone and that's that's all

442
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,079
okay, but don't don't boycott our

443
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,600
clothes. That's that's medieval is what

444
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,200
um is what they refer to it as. That's

445
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,240
that's medieval. And it's so interesting

446
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,320
to um to sort of stand by comments and

447
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,240
stand by your freedom of expression and

448
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,839
then get irritated when people don't

449
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,040
want to express themselves in your

450
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,399
clothing because they don't agree with

451
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,000
what you're saying. I think it's a bit

452
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,480
of a reflection of how fast we're

453
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,560
evolving as a people. Now, when you're

454
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,839
making that many babies, miracles

455
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,880
because parents desperately want to have

456
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
children. Of course, they can't have

457
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,560
them often times. So, when that happens

458
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
and our society can't keep up, we end up

459
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,040
with this friction. But this is how we

460
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,560
evolve. Most people in this audience, I

461
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,639
think, would agree that you'd be

462
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,120
celebrating a family that had a child

463
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,440
because they wanted the best. All right,

464
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,360
Jimmy Kim, we all of them. He opened up

465
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
recently about a very painful opening in

466
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,680
his body. He was actually very honest

467
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,880
about uh a process. Uh you want to be

468
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,000
the lead on this one. This is a topic

469
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
you and I might suffer from, but the

470
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,320
women really I don't know if I would

471
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,560
share it even on Dr. Rouser. Anyway, uh

472
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,480
Jimmy Kimmo was at South by Southwest

473
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,240
and he spoke about a procedure he had on

474
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,680
his urethra and it he they opened it was

475
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,279
closing up, I guess, and they went in

476
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,320
and opened up and then they had to go in

477
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,519
there again and open it up, which I've

478
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,560
got to give. Y'all know what he's

479
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,040
talking about, right? It it it it Oh, he

480
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,639
shared a lot. Shout out to our Mark

481
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,399
Malgan from E who broke the story. He

482
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,480
did the interview. He shared with Mark.

483
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,920
But I say I say good for Kimmel. As

484
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,760
women, we're forced to share a whole

485
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,360
lot, right? men never talk about these

486
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,639
kind of things. I didn't even know about

487
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,800
this. So, I think he's starting a

488
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,320
conversation at least. So, these urethal

489
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
strictures, they happen from trauma,

490
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,959
from inflammation, and you know,

491
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
infection, things like that. And often

492
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,920
times, you get this urge to go to the

493
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,000
bathroom. You can't cuz the straw is

494
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,240
stuck, so to speak. So, I've been

495
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,480
corresponding with him. And he says, he

496
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,199
says he's doing fine. He's enjoying the

497
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,959
joys of urination.

498
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,720
We all We're very happy for Jimmy. I was

499
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,920
going to say I was at South by Southwest

500
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,519
and I went to his taping and his

501
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,920
afterparty. He looked like he was in

502
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,040
good spirits. Um and and part of his

503
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,560
health conference. I was there for the

504
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,880
health part. So it was actually apppropo

505
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,639
that he was speaking about this. Jimmy,

506
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,720
he has turned his life around. He's in

507
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,839
great shape and lost weight and you know

508
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,519
dealt with a lot of the issues a lot of

509
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,360
us delayed dealing with. So kudos to

510
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,440
him. Isn't it a great thing that he that

511
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,120
he shared it? So many people not only

512
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,040
would be too embarrassed to tell to tell

513
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,240
their their significant other or their

514
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,920
best friend. But what about people who

515
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,360
are too scared to go to the doctor? Now

516
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,959
you have a celebrity like this saying,

517
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,399
"Hey, this is this is kind of

518
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,880
embarrassing. This was uncomfortable. I

519
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,160
got help. It's okay. You can do and men

520
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,279
don't talk about health like that. AJ,

521
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,639
you can do. They really don't. Just

522
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,680
kidding. What do you got to share, AJ?

523
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,279
Anything? No. I love having you all

524
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,850
here. We'll be right back. Thanks to our

525
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,680

biggest addictions, carbs. But your love

540
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,560
affair with bread and pasta doesn't have

541
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,360
to end. I'm excited about this cuz

542
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,959
you've got two really big new ideas. The

543
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,199
plan to eat carbs to beat carbs. Plus

544
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,199
Dancing with the Stars judge Bruno Tony

545
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,520
Ooli breaks the newest celebrity health

546
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,839
trends. I'm turning myself off. Will it

547
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:15,319
be Bravo or Brav? No. All new Oz. That's

548
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,319
coming up tomorrow.

549
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,240
You have the best intentions and all the

550
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,319
right ingredients to cook the healthy

551
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,679
meals. You set out to make this, but it

552
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,520
turns into this. I know you've all been

553
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,400
there. Or you're hoping to make these

554
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,360
little babies here. Oh, and you serve

555
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,600
your family these

556
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,080
not so happy. So, when I received an SOS

557
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,160
call from a Maryland family who say they

558
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,039
live with the worst health cook in

559
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,200
America, I knew I had to step in. Take a

560
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,679
look. My wife has been trying to cook

561
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,160
healthy, but me and the kids can't take

562
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,960
it anymore. It's disgusting. Everything

563
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,760
she cooks is either mushy or tasteless.

564
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,039
I don't like it. She has to be the worst

565
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:07,360
healthy cook in America.

566
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:10,240
What is King W? More like King Wow. This

567
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,559
is disgusting.

568
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,440
That is harsh. Tanisha is here. Did you

569
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,200
have any idea gotten that bad? No, I had

570
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,640
no idea. He's in trouble when I get

571
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,320
home, too. I agree. So on

572
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,000
you have trouble cooking just healthy

573
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,440
foods, is it all foods? No, it's just

574
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,760
healthy foods. So, I can cook the rich

575
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,200
foods like for holidays and things like

576
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,559
that, but just the healthy foods that

577
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm trying to get the kids to eat. All

578
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,360
right. So, you did us a favor. You

579
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,679
actually brought in an example of why

580
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,400
her family has labeled her the worst

581
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,200
healthy cook in America. Um, let me just

582
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,320
look at this. Well, it's not as I guess

583
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,240
what it probably would have looked like

584
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,440
if you'd Well, I don't know. Yeah, it's

585
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,400
a little dry. It looks a little dry.

586
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,559
What What is this actually? Looks like

587
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,960
Sahara Desert.

588
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,520
It is a zucchini and ground turkey

589
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,440
casserole. It was supposed to start off

590
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,919
creamy, but it was kind of dry. So,

591
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,360
sometimes I'd like to add cheese to get

592
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,200
it looking a little better. It didn't

593
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,240
work out and thus the looks on your kids

594
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,520
and your husband. All right, here's the

595
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,720
thing. I want you all to be healthy and

596
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,480
I want healthy food to be something that

597
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,480
your family will enjoy. So, you are in

598
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,400
great luck today because I brought you a

599
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,039
good friend, celebrity chef Lydia

600
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,720
Bastian. She's here with tips for all at

601
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,840
home healthy cooks who feel like the

602
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,960
chefs are in their own kitchen, but

603
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,200
they're not really in there. Come on

604
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,200
out, Lydia.

605
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,640
Welcome.

606
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,120
Tanisha's story. How common is it? Very

607
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,280
common. Tanisha, don't lose your spirit

608
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,600
because I hear this all the time and

609
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,600
it's very easy to be corrected. It's

610
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,280
very correctable. Okay. You're you're a

611
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,440
grandma, right? Five kids. Five times

612
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,440
over. I'm a grandma and they're about

613
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,000
the age of yours. Actually, mine are a

614
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,080
little bit bigger. So what is the key to

615
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,360
fixing this problem of being a healthy

616
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,760
cook and at the same time getting kids

617
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,679
to embrace it? Uh the key is because you

618
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,000
want to be healthy also I heard. Yeah.

619
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,679
So it's getting choosing the primary

620
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,440
ingredients, the right primary

621
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,760
ingredients. Be conscious about your

622
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,160
pasta. Be conscious about you buying

623
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,600
vegetables and using vegetables, using

624
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,440
lighter meats, chickens, fish or less of

625
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,440
the more tasty meats. It's okay. You

626
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,919
want some crumbled sausages. Don't put

627
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,080
whole sausages. Open it up. crumble it

628
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,320
up and put a little crumbles in there

629
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,240
and that'll give you a lot of flavor

630
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
texture and you don't need a lot of it

631
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,440
to make it flavorful. That's my problem.

632
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,200
Well, that makes work in that a little

633
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,760
bit. So, one dish that you cannot get

634
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,520
right is this zucchini casserole, ground

635
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,039
turkey casserole that I think we saw

636
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,960
evidence of. So, Lydia, if you don't

637
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,200
mind, show us your recipe, your way of

638
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,200
making this. Okay. So, this is basically

639
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,559
a casserole. It ends up a casserole like

640
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,120
yours with pasta. Your kids love pasta.

641
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,039
They do. Okay. So, the choice is first.

642
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,679
Whole wheat pasta. Okay. Will they know

643
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:57,200
the difference? No, not really. And the

644
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,840
sauce now. Tomatoes. Plum tomatoes. Some

645
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,320
nice zucchini, sliced zucchini. You have

646
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
onions. You have your proteins. Chicken

647
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,840
in there. Now you can put shrimp in

648
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,720
there. You can put whatever they like.

649
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,240
Fish in there and substitute it. So this

650
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,240
is the Now you notice the ratio of the

651
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,000
vegetables and the protein versus the

652
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,919
pasta. Throw in the pasta. Go ahead.

653
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,360
Okay. The pasta is cooked, but it's

654
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,120
always a little bit undercooked. I leave

655
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,360
it because I don't like mushy pasta. Do

656
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,360
you like mushy pasta? I do not. Okay.

657
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,200
Kids like it, but I don't. No. No. But

658
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,720
again, you got to teach you. No. No. Put

659
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Put some more in. Put some more in. We

660
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,039
have to fill this. We have to fill it.

661
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,000
Come on. That's it. No, you're doing

662
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,000
okay. You're doing okay. All right. So,

663
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,600
here we are. What I would do this now, I

664
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,919
would add a little bit of the grated

665
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:47,039
cheese. Go ahead. You mix. And I add

666
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,840
Okay. So now we're flavoring this. You

667
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:53,520
know, the question is of the flavor.

668
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,520
Fresh herbs, a great source of diversity

669
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,080
of flavor and bringing that freshness.

670
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,080
Do your kids object to They do not. They

671
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,480
like that. They like flavor. Mine just

672
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,480
never has any.

673
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,840
Well, are we getting there? A little bit

674
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,520
of cheese. You notice all of this? This

675
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,520
is cooking. The pasta is cooking in the

676
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,840
sauce. It's absorbing the flavors. We're

677
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,280
getting there. Lots of fresh basil.

678
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,559
Okay. So, how do you layer this now? You

679
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,720
just you just dump it all in there at

680
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,320
once. So, now No, no. Nice and easy.

681
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,960
We'll do it. Go ahead. Now, you you do

682
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,840
it. You've done this. Do do a a layer of

683
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,760
that.

684
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,080
Like, put about half of it. And it's

685
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,679
okay if it's a little bit of uh uh uh

686
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,600
moisture in the bottom because as it

687
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,600
cooks, it will absorb. Actually, you

688
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,840
need a little bit. Okay. I I heard you

689
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,760
saying that yours is a little dry. Yes.

690
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,200
Most of the time. Okay. So this is how

691
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,640
you how you avoid that step. So here we

692
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,760
are halfway through. We'll put a little

693
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,440
bit of cheese again for flavor. We'll

694
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,760
put a little bit of the mozzarella

695
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,799
fontina. Nice flavorful cheese in

696
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,280
between. So when they get when they get

697
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,120
in there, there's a little surprise and

698
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,640
flavor. Now put the rest in there on

699
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,960
there.

700
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,880
Okay. And what do you put on the very

701
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,120
top again? Some more cheese. The same

702
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,280
layer. The same thing. a layer on top.

703
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,320
And I say more for the top because I I

704
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,480
like that that crust. And you know,

705
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,240
something like this is is great when

706
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,919
when your kids bring home their friends

707
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,039
and whatever. You put it in the oven.

708
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,880
So, how long do you leave it in the oven

709
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,320
for? Well, this is just about everything

710
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,000
is just about cooked. You can put a

711
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,440
little more. So, I would say about 20

712
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,520
minutes, 30 minutes. If you want to give

713
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,840
yourself more time, you put a foil paper

714
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,320
on top of it. Let it kind of get really

715
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,159
warm because you can prepare this and

716
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,679
leave it cool and you can prepare it and

717
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,640
almost leave it in the refrigerator when

718
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,799
you come home. Oh yes. You put the top

719
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,080
the cheese and put it in the oven. Let's

720
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,440
see if you like the taste. Would Would

721
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,360
your family like that taste is the

722
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,120
question? They will love it. They'll

723
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,159
love you.

724
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,320
They're going to love you, too. Thank

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,919

end. I'm excited about this cuz we've

747
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,840
got two really big new ideas. The plan

748

be Bravo or Brav? No. All new odds.

753
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,200
That's coming up tomorrow.

754
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,890
[Music]

755
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Yoga is known for its relaxation and

756
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,960
flexibility benefits, but it's also a

757
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,559
full body workout that strengthens and

758
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,440
lengthens and tightens your abs. So,

759
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,840
today, easy yoga moves to get the abs of

760
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,080
your dreams. Yoga instructor and fitness

761
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,440
guru Glenn Lawrence is here. So, revved

762
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,279
up yoga, how does it actually help with

763
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,760
b with the belly, the abs? Well,

764
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,440
arguably every move that you do in yoga

765
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,840
targets the abs. So, it's a no-brainer

766
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,039
that you pick yoga to flatten them out.

767
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,640
And how does it work for beginners

768
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,559
versus experts? It doesn't matter. We

769
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,240
picked some pretty user friendly moves

770
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,360
today, and I'm going to show you ways

771
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,600
that you can kick them up if you want

772
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,320
to. So, it doesn't really matter. Who

773
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,200
wants stronger, slender abdomen bellies

774
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,600
and stomachs? Ladies, come on out. We

775
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,840
have six volunteers from the audience.

776
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,440
Believe me, they're not experts. They're

777
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,559
just like you. Maybe there some of them

778
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,679
are experts. We're going to find out in

779
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,159
a second. But everyone start doing this

780
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,919
with us. Take it away. Simple moves to

781
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,080
get us revved up abs. All right. So, the

782
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,919
first one we're going to do is elbow to

783
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,240
knee pa. So, you're going to start in

784
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,760
what's called chair pose in yoga. Nice

785
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,159
flat back. You're going to bring the

786
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,000
hands behind your head and keeping the

787
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,320
back flat, you're going to tip it elbow

788
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,919
to knee. Come back to center. Elbow to

789
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,279
knee. Keep going. That's it. Smile.

790
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,440
Smile. If you're not having fun, it's

791
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,679
worthless, right? And I like I don't

792
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,840
like to do counting. I like to have a

793
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,240
timer. I'm notorious for my timer. So,

794
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,080
30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on

795
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,640
your fitness level. Two minutes of this.

796
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,559
Oh, yeah.

797
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,799
How you guys doing back there? How is

798
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,400
it? Great. Good. All right. Right. You

799
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,880
feel that? That's that's going to target

800
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,400
our waist. Trim the waist and get in the

801
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,159
side into the obliques. All right. I

802
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,760
quit. All right. Let's go to the floor.

803
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,760
I quit for you guys, by the way. I'm

804
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,600
trying to help you.

805
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,600
So, everybody has a block. We're going

806
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,039
to lie down on our backs now. And you're

807
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,279
going to put the block between your

808
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,919
inner thighs, right? We're going to

809
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,520
raise the roof with our legs. Okay?

810
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,600
You're going to flex the feet. Arms are

811
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,919
down by your side. And all you're going

812
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,880
to do is tiny little moves. Lifting your

813
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:19,200
legs straight up, squeezing the block.

814
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,919
And again, you want to do 30 seconds to

815
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,960
two minutes. So, no counting. I want

816
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
folks at home doing this because I'll

817
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,080
tell you this little move is much more

818
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,760
impactful than I thought. Yeah. What

819
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,520
part of our belly is this workout? We're

820
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,960
we're working nice lower abdominals

821
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,240
which everyone's concerned about. And

822
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,400
putting the block between the inner

823
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,200
thighs gives us second benefit of adding

824
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,559
a little tone to the inner thighs.

825
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,159
Everybody's good. Same thing. 30

826
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,200
seconds, two minutes. All right.

827
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,400
Depending on your fitness. Look at this.

828
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,640
The sadistic smile. Yes. You know me.

829
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,760
That's it. So, we're going to keep the

830
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,200
block. Might as well just keep the

831
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,200
block. If you guys want to just rock

832
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,400
yourself up to seated. Keep the block

833
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,000
between your inner thighs. We're going

834
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,159
to go to boat pose. And this is going to

835
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,240
target the whole front of the stomach.

836
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,520
Now, all right. This is going to be

837
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,640
level one. Legs, lower legs parallel to

838
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,880
the floor. Level two and level three.

839
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,120
And all you're going to do is hold it.

840
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,720
Got to breathe. Squeeze the block. You

841
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,880
can feel it, right? If you shake, it's

842
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,640
good. We're going on a boat trip. It's

843
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,360
like a little trip. Level one or two.

844
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,720
30 seconds to two minutes. If it's too

845
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,240
easy for you, you can bring your arms

846
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,360
up. You can bring them course. Make it

847
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,960
worse. Make it worse. You can bring it

848
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,640
in and out. Bring it on. Maybe the pain

849
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,240
more pain. So, again, 30 seconds to 2

850
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,080
minutes of this will really tire you. Oh

851
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,440
gosh. They're always trying to sabotage

852
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,200
my timer when I'm working out. I

853
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,600
shouldn't have shown off. All right. All

854
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,679
right. And the last one, last one is

855
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,360
going to be a forearm plank. So, we're

856
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,279
going to come on to the hands and knees.

857
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,880
Lower down to your elbows. It's really

858
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,880
important that your elbows are under

859
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,039
your shoulders for proper support. So,

860
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,039
our bodies are made to fit ourselves.

861
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,399
You want to pivot the arms. Wrap your

862
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,159
fingers around your elbows. That way,

863
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,440
you know they're shoulder width apart.

864
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,240
If they're too far apart, you're going

865
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,480
to overstress the the chest. Okay. Bring

866
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,000
them out. Palms flat. He's already in

867
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,880
it. I I was copying. And then and then

868
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,840
go ahead and press trying to help. I

869
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,679
tell my belly is sore. I would not. Yes.

870
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,679
30 seconds to 2 minutes. Two minutes is

871
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,279
a super challenge here. You could always

872
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,600
just drop it down, take a break, and

873
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,679
come back up. But right before you quit,

874
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,960
give it another two breaths and then

875
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,080
come down. Baby, putting your knees down

876
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,600
is a sign of weakness, everybody. Oo.

877
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,559
All right, that's the challenge right

878
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,919
there. They're still holding. I'm going

879
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,120
to go to break with us. Keep holding it.

880
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,360
If you're at home, please do this with

881

How has yoga changed your life? I

891
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,240
started doing yoga 2 years ago and

892
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,080
wasn't a huge fan, but over time I began

893
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,000
to relish how it made me feel. Now I'm

894
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,520
fullon obsessed. I make all my friends

895
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,520

[Music]

910
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,760
In the six years I've been doing this

911
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,760
show, I've been lucky to meet some

912
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,360
pretty amazing people. But today, you're

913
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,000
about to meet someone who's not just

914
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,679
amazing, but inspiring. She touched my

915
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,360
heart. I found out about her from the

916
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,399
Makea-Wish Foundation. And when they

917
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,440
told me about her wish, well, I couldn't

918
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,799
say no. Take a look. Thank you so much

919
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,039
for granting my Make a Wish. I chose you

920
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:03,039
because I want to be a physician when I

921
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:06,480
get older. Your show is so entertaining

922
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,279
and educational at the same time. When I

923
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,840
was diagnosed with medula blasto in

924
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,480
August of 2013,

925
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:18,080
it changed my life forever. I couldn't

926
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,640
do things that other people got to do.

927
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,919
But now since I'm cancerree, I can

928
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,120
finally do those things. Thank you again

929
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,760
and see you soon.

930
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,279
Aubrey's Wish is one of 14,000 wishes

931
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,640
granted by the Makea-Wish Foundation

932
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,919
each year. And it's been a great honor

933
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,000
to spend the day with her. In fact, we

934
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,799
had a blast behind the scenes taping

935
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,519
another show earlier today.

936
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,880
How are you? Good. Can I give you a hug?

937
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,799
Such a great honor that you wanted to

938
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,480
come see the show. I got all kinds of

939
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,960
good stuff planned for you today. Ready

940
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,919
to go? Come on. First stop, a meet and

941
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,760
greet with my show guests.

942
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,320
being here. Then I took Aubrey to

943
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,320
rehearsal where she served as my standin

944
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,960
and helped me get ready for the show.

945
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,519
You okay? While I headed to hair and

946
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,760
makeup, Aubrey, who dreams of becoming a

947
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,159
doctor, got up close and personal with

948
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,440
some real human organs, compliments of

949
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:17,600
our medical team.

950
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Finally, it was showtime. Get him. You

951
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,440
ready to go? Let's do it. Yog.

952
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,480
[Music]

953
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,159
Aubrey is still here and if she still

954
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,640
has the energy, I would love her to come

955
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:39,320
down and be my assistant of the day. Are

956
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,320
we come to come on down?

957
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,120
So, I know you were only supposed to

958
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,960
play backstage, but I was so proud to

959
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,039
have you here today. You okay? Yep. How

960
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,799
you feeling? Great. So, how was the show

961
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,039
backstage? It was really good. What did

962
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,799
you like the most about it? Um, probably

963
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,640
seeing the organs. You like those

964
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,399
organs, don't you? Yeah, I do. And you

965
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,120
want to be a surgeon, I understand.

966
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:07,840
Maybe more a doctor or physician, a

967
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,720
regular internist. Surgeon. And what do

968
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,000
you love about medicine? Um, I love

969
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,120
helping people, making them feel better.

970
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,480
And you know what that's like. So, you

971
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,399
told me you were fascinated by the

972
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,000
digestive system of the body. There's a

973
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,120
lot of things there. So, if you're

974
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,799
willing to do this, since you are the

975
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,080
assistant of the day, I'd like you to

976
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,600
help me share something with the

977
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,679
audience. All right. Okay. Now, I

978
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,840
customized this for you. Of course, you

979
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,039
have the purple gloves.

980
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,399
Don't forget those. They're pretty

981
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,240
important. And I did a little homework.

982
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,720
I was talking to your mom who's just a

983
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,799
doll, you know. And she shared with me

984
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,960
that you have a tremendous affinity for,

985
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,399
is this true? Pancakes and pizza. Yes.

986
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,720
No one's ever admitted that on the show

987
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,279
before. All right. So, we'll put the

988
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,840
pancakes in your mouth because this is

989
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,519
example of your digestive system. Here's

990
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,880
the pizza. Why don't you hold that for a

991
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,640
second? So, these are your teeth over

992
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,880
here. Okay. Right. So, the teeth are

993
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,640
like scissors. So, chop up that pizza in

994
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,320
your in your stomach over here. And I'll

995
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,360
work these little babies. All right. To

996
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,200
get going on this will be the teeth

997
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,399
there. And cut the pizza up. I need more

998
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,919
help with that. I can mash this with

999
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,159
these. These are my these are your mers.

1000
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,119
I'm working. Do I put them here? You can

1001
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,159
put them anywhere you want cuz they're

1002
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,599
going to end up in your stomach, right?

1003
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,359
No matter where you put them to start

1004
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,639
with, once they're on your plate, at

1005
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,320
least at your age, they pretty much end

1006
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,320
up in your stomach. Okay, that's good.

1007
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,399
Let's throw that in there. Now, add some

1008
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,919
saliva. That's the raw ingredient we

1009
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,359
need. Good. Add that in there. You can,

1010
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,720
if you really like the food, you usually

1011
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,679
salivate a lot. Yeah. Is that what

1012
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,520
happens to you? Yeah. Oliv Oh, that was

1013
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,280
a lot. All right. Now, you're really

1014
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,280
salivating. Okay. Now, take what's in

1015
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,760
your mouth and you got to put it in your

1016
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,879
stomach. Yeah. So, remember when you

1017
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,240
learned about this in biology? Go ahead

1018
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,520
and pour that in there. When the food

1019
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,800
goes in your stomach, you end up

1020
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,720
releasing gastric juices like that. Oo.

1021
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,320
Look like that. Yeah. Now, let's get our

1022
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,000
hands in there. We got to work this up a

1023
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,720
little bit cuz the stomach begins to

1024
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,680
digest all this food. Oh, okay. Now,

1025
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,400
where does it go from the stomach to the

1026
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,480
small intestine? Very well done. Okay.

1027
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,200
Let's empty it in there. That's good.

1028
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,440
Empty the food in the small intestines.

1029
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,960
Oh, it's a sloppy intestine. It's okay.

1030
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,960
It can't be neat all the time. Keep

1031
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,680
going. Okay. Now, once it's in your

1032
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,359
small intestine, then it's got to get

1033
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,200
pushed through the small intestine. And

1034
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,480
here's where this crazy stuff happens.

1035
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,920
Not all the food. Go. Let's milk it

1036
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,680
through here. Push that in there and

1037
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,480
milk it through. Not all the food gets

1038
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,079
through. A lot of the food has to get

1039
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,800
sucked into the bloodstream like down

1040
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,200
below. And those nutrients, you broke

1041
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,119
the intestine. You just broke the

1042
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,440
intestine. No one has ever broke an

1043
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,119
intestine before. This should all forget

1044
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,960
about this. It's fine. So notice how the

1045
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,960
juices are leaking into the bloodstream.

1046
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,560
So the body sucks its nutrients out of

1047
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,079
the small intestine as it's supposed to.

1048
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,760
Keep going though because we know what

1049
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,359
happens next. You can push it way in

1050
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,119
there. Milk it all through here.

1051
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,079
Whatever the body can't absorb into the

1052
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,440
bloodstream, where does it go? Goes down

1053
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,040
here into the colon. You know what's

1054
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,040
coming, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. It's like

1055
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,680
a boa constrictor this intestine. There

1056
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,000
he goes. Now come down here. Once it's

1057
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,200
in the colon, you've got to actually

1058
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,520
milk it through. So go ahead and take

1059
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,079
this. What's the major goal of the small

1060
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,839
of the colon? It's to absorb fluid. So

1061
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,839
any extra fluid that's in there gets

1062
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,200
absorbed. Push that all the way down.

1063
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,839
And then it goes to the rectum, which is

1064
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,119
this bag. And guess what happens from

1065
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,440
the rectum? It goes out. It goes out,

1066
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,800
doesn't it? So go ahead and demonstrate.

1067
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,079
Now it's too late to turn back now.

1068
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,680
Your your classmates will see this

1069
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,280
happen, but there it goes from the

1070
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:39,440
correctum into the toilet. And she did

1071
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,920
it perfectly and brilliantly done.

1072
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Did you ever have a dream that you'd be

1073
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,280
squeezing poop into a toilet when you

1074
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,400
made your Make a Wish Foundation dream?

1075
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,000
No. Not at all. Yes. I hope I hear back

1076
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,280
from them in a positive way about this.

1077
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,720
That's good. You've gotten it all out of

1078
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,760
there. Nicely done. Listen. Keep your

1079
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,040
gloves on. Keep your gloves on. I want

1080
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,560
to show you something else. This is

1081
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,240
actually a real intestine. It was such a

1082
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,280
blessing having you on the show. I

1083
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,200
really want to have you take You can

1084
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,280
take your gloves off. Uh put new ones

1085
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,599
on. I want you to appreciate uh because

1086
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,359
we didn't get to see this before how

1087
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,119
magnificent the human body is. And when

1088
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,839
I look at you and I see how wonderfully

1089
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,680
you've done after a really bad problem,

1090
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,440
I realize the marvels of medicine. And I

1091
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,240
also realize how unique and special each

1092
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,280
of our bodies are. So the intestinal

1093
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,880
system is made up of these tiny little

1094
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,240
nooks and crannies. And this is the

1095
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,320
rectum. That's what you just squeeze the

1096
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,520
poop out of. Right? This is your small

1097
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,440
intestine. See how it's smaller? Go

1098
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,960
ahead and feel that.

1099
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,240
And as you look at that, and I show

1100
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,240
these organs on the show because I think

1101
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,079
the body is majestic. Yeah. And I think

1102
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,200
we're all so special and we really

1103
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,280
appreciate it when we look at our

1104
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,160
organs, parts of our body that we don't

1105
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,839
always see from the outside. Yeah, these

1106
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,480
are cool. They are pretty cool, aren't

1107
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,680
they? Yeah. So, I was thinking what kind

1108
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
of a prize to give you, and I was going

1109
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,040
to send you home with these intestines,

1110
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,880
but your mom won't let you take them.

1111
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,960
And because she says I'd killjoy your

1112
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,880
mother, I instead decided to give you a

1113
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,280
more orthodox. You can take these off uh

1114
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,200
present. So, I'm giving you your own Dr.

1115
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,720
Oz jacket.

1116
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:10,480
Now, the you can take that off.

1117
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,000
These we give very, very rarely on the

1118
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
show.

1119
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,160
And they're notice they have special

1120
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,520
buttons. H they take a little bit of

1121
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,599
wearing in, but you should wear this all

1122
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,000
around school from now on. People will

1123
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,240
be very intimidated by you. And I want

1124
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,560
you to have your own pair of Dr. Oz

1125
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,720
scrubs. But most importantly,

1126
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,200
since you're going to be a doctor, I

1127
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,480
want you to have your stethoscope on and

1128
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,440
listen to the hearts of all the people

1129
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:42,359
you're going to touch in your life. So,

1130
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,359
take care. We'll be right back.

1131
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,040
Did you hear it?

1132
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,320
All new odds. And tackling one of your

1133
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,240
biggest addictions, carbs. But your love

1134
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,839
affair with bread and pasta doesn't have

1135
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,720
to end. I'm excited about this because

1136
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:02,320
we've got two really big new ideas. The

1137
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,960
plan to eat carbs to beat carbs. Plus,

1138
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,480

coming up tomorrow.

1143

All new Oz. And tackling one of your

[Applause]

1156
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,720
I have a terrible fear of heights. And

1157
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,400
since I'm always telling you to step out

1158
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,560
of your comfort zone, I decided to

1159
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,040
finally step out of mine and face my

1160
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,720
fear. So, I went on an adventure. My

1161
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,800
team has prepared a surprise for me.

1162
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,839
They have chronicled this adventure on

1163
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,320
this little video. Let's take a look at

1164
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:12,280
what they did. I don't like heights, but

1165
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,280
other than that, I'm good to go.

1166

[Music]

1168
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,640
It doesn't look too bad, does it? I can

1169
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,400
tell you it was much faster. They must

1170
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,320
have slowed that down. I went whipping

1171
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,240
across this thing. That's a video of me

1172
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,640
ziplining at the Mall of America in

1173
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,920
Minneapolis. And it was much I thought

1174
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,079
scarier than it looks. Anyway, you can

1175
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,359
watch me. There's a version of that, a

1176
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,680
scarier version I'm going to make for

1177
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,119
facebook.com/docraz

1178
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,040
and share the fear you're ready to

1179
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,400
conquer on my page so I can celebrate

1180
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,680
with you. We could all do it together.

1181
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,680
Now, it's time for in case you missed

1182
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,359
it. First up, the newest cast member of

1183
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,520
Real Housewives of Atlantic, Claudia

1184
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,640
Jordan. She showed us because I was on

1185
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,400
the show today that there's something

1186
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,720
that annoys her even more than her

1187
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,560
fellow housewives. the corns on her

1188
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,160
feet. Now, she's lived with these for

1189
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,760
years, and I'm offering her some help.

1190
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,880
Now, we all know that salicylic acid

1191
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,240
works. It comes in little patches. You

1192
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,079
can put them on the corn, but here's a

1193
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,760
special foot bath that could also help.

1194
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,160
I hear this from a lot of viewers. You

1195
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,760
soak your feet for 15 minutes in warm

1196
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,440
soapy water, but you got to add a cup of

1197
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,200
apple cider vinegar to it. Then, use a

1198
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,040
pummus stone to gently, gently is the

1199
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,920
operative word here, remove layers of

1200
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,280
dead skin. Then, dab on some castor oil

1201
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,560
after you've taken your foot out and

1202
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,960
stride. Just take a little bit of the

1203
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,560
cotton swab, just dab it on there. And

1204
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,400
over the course of about 10 days, those

1205
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,680
corns will get much better. Finally,

1206
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,560
please be careful of dubious people

1207
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,839

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,440
