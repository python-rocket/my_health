1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,880
Today, it's the disease you fear most,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,440
cancer. But it doesn't have to be that

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,519
way. Diagnosis is often made too late

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,840
because the warning signs of the disease

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,000
mimic other conditions. So, today I'm

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,720
giving you the power to detect the four

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,160
cancer symptoms women are most likely to

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,640
ignore. So, let's get right to the

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,880
detective work. The first symptom is

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,080
bruising because bruising can be a

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,240
symptom of leukemia.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,240
Bruising is a symptom you just might

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,200
ignore because you think you're just

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,680
getting older. You're klutz. You might

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,480
be anemic. They're minor side effects

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,960
from your medications. But bruising on

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,680
the body could actually be a symptom of

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,840
leukemia because this cancer is a

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,920
disease of the blood that can slow down

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,480
the production of platelets which help

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,640
clot your blood. With fewer platelets,

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,800
your blood's ability to clot diminishes

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,440
drastically, giving way to easy

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,440
bruising.

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,760
So, how do you know if your bruising is

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
normal or if it's a sign of leukemia?

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,879
Maria's here to find out. You get

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,640
bruised often, I hear.

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,720
I do. I have a two and a four-year-old

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,560
and they think I'm a jungle gym, so my

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,200
legs are pretty much all bruised up.

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,840
Up and down.

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,360
Up and down.

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,400
All right. So, the issue of bruising, of

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,479
course, is an important one because we

36
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
all get it from different reasons. When

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,040
you get your bruises, how long do they

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,560
last?

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960
Probably about a week,

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,880
right?

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,119
Which is a pretty normal term. So, let's

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,720
go over when to worry. When are bruises

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,240
concerning to a doctor? First issue,

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,439
fevers and chills. Does it ever happen

45
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,200
to you?

46
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,920
Not really. Only when I'm sick, which is

47
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
not often.

48
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
All right. Second big quick clue is

49
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
whether people have persistent fatigue.

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,479
Have you experienced that?

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,920
Well, I have the normal fatigue of a

52
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,680
mother.

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,799
It's harder question to answer. The kind

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,320
of fatigue you have with leukemia,

55
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,840
really, you just can't get out of bed.

56
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,000
It's not related to a tough day at all.

57
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,680
And the last symptom is often bone pain.

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,360
Whereas the bone cancer is growing

59
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
inside the bone. It will really stretch

60
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,159
it and you'll feel the aching in there.

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,119
Does it have happened to you?

62
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,320
No, I feel great.

63
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,320
Well, I think you're good to go. I'm

64
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,000
happy for that. All right. So, if you

65
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
answered no to all of these, then fine.

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,880
The bruising is normal. But for anyone

67
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,079
who had bruising coupled with any of

68
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,759
these symptoms, I don't want you to

69
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,280
ignore it. We can cure these problems if

70
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
we know about them in time. The next

71
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,680
cancer symptom that many people ignore,

72
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
women in particular, is indigestion.

73
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,000
Because indigestion can be a symptom of

74
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,560
esophageal cancer.

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
Indigestion. It's the symptom you ignore

76
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,040
because you think it's caused by

77
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,920
something you ate. Yesterday's late

78
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,480
night binge, cheating on your diet.

79
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,720
You're busy and always eating on the go.

80
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,440
But indigestion could also be a symptom

81
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,239
of esophageal cancer when it's caused by

82
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,000
chronic heartburn or acid reflux. That's

83
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,239
when the contents of your stomach back

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,879
up into your esophagus, irritating the

85
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,319
lining. and over time creating abnormal

86
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,239
cells that morph into cancer.

87
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,480
So when is indigestion a sign of

88
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,080
esophageal cancer? Michelle, like most

89
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,280
women, has had some indigestion. She's

90
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
here to find out. So I just showed you a

91
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
little video explaining why I'm

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,440
concerned about indigestion. If I can,

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to actually show you a real

94
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,959
stomach and esophagus.

95
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,400
One normal, one not so normal. So I just

96
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,200
want to point out that is you know as

97
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,360
you have a normal esophagus here moving

98
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,760
into the stomach there's a very smooth

99
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,239
transition. Go ahead and feel that and

100
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,840
compare that to this not so smooth. Look

101
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,159
at look at how the esophagus shrunk

102
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,480
here.

103
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,440
Yeah.

104
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,959
You see it doesn't have these nice

105
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
little lines anymore. It's all scarred

106
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,400
in that's makes it shorten but also

107
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,840
pulls it together. And feel right here.

108
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
That thick stuff

109
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,159
that's an early cancer.

110
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
Oo.

111
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,360
We're seeing a lot more of this problem

112
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,640
because of that acid issue. So how long

113
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,200
does it last when you get it? Cuz that's

114
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,760
a big clue. Um, sometimes overnight. It

115
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,959
depends.

116
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,040
Does it last for a couple days?

117
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
No, no, no, no. Um, I'm usually going by

118
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
the next day. It's usually over next

119
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,239
day.

120
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
That That's a good sign. Do you ever get

121
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,200
sore throats that last a long time?

122
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,319
No. Mm-

123
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,519
That's an important sign because the

124
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,000
acid can go up and burn your vocal

125
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,200
cords.

126
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,959
Oh, okay. Didn't know that.

127
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,239
So, again, anyone who has indigestion

128
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,680
was coupled with the other symptoms I

129
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,959
just gave you to worry about.

130
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
They're not going to ignore that. Again,

131
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,040
a treatable problem if we find it.

132
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,400
Okay, great. Thanks for telling me.

133
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,239
Let's get to another symptom that you're

134
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,760
likely to ignore and I want you to

135
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,720
detect this one. It's night sweats. And

136
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,239
the reason I'm concerned about night

137
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,400
sweats is they can be a symptom of

138
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
lymphoma.

139
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,200
Night sweats are a symptom easy to

140
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,599
ignore because your hormones go haywire

141
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,959
at least once a month. It's just a hot

142
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,680
flash. The bed's too warm. You're

143
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,720
fighting a fever. But night sweats could

144
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,880
also mean lymphoma, a cancer of your

145
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,040
lymphatic system. That's because the

146
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,520
progression of lymphoma and the way your

147
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,240
body fights infections are similar.

148
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,400
Mobilizing immune cells causing fever,

149
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,080
achy muscles, and night sweats.

150
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,680
So, when are those night sweats a sign

151
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,000
of cancer? Jan's here to find out. She

152
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
says she sometimes has occasional night

153
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,120
sweats. So, describe them for me. How

154
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,840
often do you have them?

155
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,880
I'm over 40. So,

156
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,560
maybe uh maybe once a week,

157
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,880
often during the month,

158
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,440
right? four times, five times a month.

159
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,639
So, lymphas can cause problems in many

160
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,919
different ways, but let me if I can

161
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
explain what's going on inside your body

162
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,919
when you have that diagnosis. Yes, this

163
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
is a normal spleen. You see how it's

164
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,360
elegant and sort of thin? This is about

165
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
the size of your cell phone. That's how

166
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,080
you can think about your spleen. It's

167
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,440
way up here in the upper left side of

168
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,160
your belly, right?

169
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,120
Uh, however, when it's infiltrated by a

170
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
tumor,

171
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,000
it looks like that.

172
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,280
So you can take your gloves off because

173
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
I'm going to teach you when you should

174
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,000
worry about night sweats because you're

175
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,520
right, they do happen a lot when you get

176
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,080
past age 40 and they last a long time

177
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,280
sometimes. So the first clue we always

178
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,720
look for if you were to tell your doctor

179
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,560
you have night sweats is whether or not

180
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,919
you have swollen lymph nodes. You know

181
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
how to examine for those?

182
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
No.

183
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,360
You all want to do this with me

184
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
if we can. So everyone sit straw in the

185
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,880
straw in the chair. I want take three

186
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,120
fingers and then very lightly press

187
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,720
behind your ears. Just gently press

188
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,080
behind your ears. You shouldn't feel

189
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,759
anything abnormal there but you do have

190
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,240
lymph nodes. So you start there and then

191
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,479
work your way down on each side of your

192
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,560
neck like this down to the jawline and

193
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,360
then work it around the jawline here and

194
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,840
then gently move down from the jawline

195
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,280
along these muscles to your collar bone

196
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,479
right here. Now if you feel a small

197
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,120
really uh flexible movable lump

198
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,319
okay size of a kidney bean or so I don't

199
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,000
worry about that. You know when you're a

200
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,199
kid you get those really swollen nodes

201
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,240
you know if they're tender by the way

202
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,479
that's a good sign.

203
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,400
Tender lymph nodes means infection. If

204
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,240
it's a painless lymph node and it's

205
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,919
bigger than that little kidney bean and

206
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,039
the areas I just showed you and that

207
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,400
makes me concerned especially if you

208
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,600
can't move it that readily because

209
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,120
tumors will grow and they'll sort of

210
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,360
stick to the tissues around them.

211
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,800
Okay,

212
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
that's one of the first big things. I

213
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
don't see anything visually. Do you have

214
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,199
anything?

215
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
No.

216
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,560
You felt pretty healthy?

217
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
I do.

218
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,280
Yeah, you look good. Your thyroid is

219
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,039
sort of prominent by the way.

220
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,479
Did you notice that?

221
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,840
I have noticed that recently.

222
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,199
So, a little fullness in there. Just a

223
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,080
little little hint since you're on the

224
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,600
show. All right.

225
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,720
Thank you.

226
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,520
Forget about that for now. We're talking

227
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,160
about more important things like

228
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,680
lymphas. Uh how about problems with with

229
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,639
breathing? Any difficulty with that?

230
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,759
No, not at all. Right.

231
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,720
That's another issue I worry about

232
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,400
because that will often go along with

233
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
lymphas. And finally, unexplained weight

234
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
loss. I know you all want to lose

235
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,199
weight. Yes.

236
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
But when you lose weight, when you're

237
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,520
not trying to lose weight, that's what

238
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm speaking about.

239
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,479
No, no weight loss.

240
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,759
No weight loss. Darn it. All right. So,

241
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,039
if you get night sweats plus any of

242
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,240
those symptoms, that's when you have to

243
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,880
worry. Thanks very much.

244
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Good. Thank you.

245
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,599
Let's get to one more symptom that I

246
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,280
don't want you to ignore. It's bleeding

247
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,720
in between your periods. Remember,

248
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,160
bleeding between your periods is a

249
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,160
concern for a lot of reasons, but it can

250
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,560
es especially be an issue if you have

251
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,960
uterine cancer.

252
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,280
Bleeding between periods is a symptom

253
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,520
women ignore because you're stressed

254
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,919
out, you're on the pill. It's just

255
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,759
another sign of menopause. You've got

256
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,319
fibroids and you think they're probably

257
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,759
harmless. But irregular bleeding could

258
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,759
be a symptom of uterine cancer. In fact,

259
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
it's actually the most common symptom

260
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
because the cancerous lining of the

261
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,240
uterus constantly continues to grow and

262
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,599
shed causing the abnormal bleeding.

263
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,120
So, let's look at a uterus and what

264
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,720
happens when you get a cancer there.

265
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
Normally, it's pretty small size. It's

266
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280
like two golf balls attached to each

267
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,639
other basically with these little

268
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,400
ovaries next to it. But that's the

269
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,599
uterus there. Let me show you what

270
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,080
happens if you have a uterine tumor.

271
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,840
It turns to that.

272
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
Now, look at the size difference here.

273
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,120
you know very small sort of dainty

274
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,240
looking structure becomes massively

275
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,240
enlarged and it becomes thick and so big

276
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
you think how could I imagine not

277
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,680
knowing this is there but you'll miss

278
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,720
the diagnosis sometimes because there's

279
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,240
a lot of space in your belly you'll

280
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,680
think you put a little weight on so the

281
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,440
question is when should you worry about

282
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,840
breakthrough bleeding you worry about it

283
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,160
when it's coupled with bloating you

284
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,560
worry about if it's causing pain uh

285
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,560
during urination or during sex and you

286
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
worry about it if you've got pelvic pain

287
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,080
those are the big clues do not ignore

288
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,120
those symptoms all of these issues you

289
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,959
can control. I know we don't want to

290
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,719
sometimes know if you got problems, but

291
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,399
I picked specifically problems that you

292
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,080

293
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,360
