00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,000
As the cost of medicine skyrockets,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,839
people are going to dangerous lengths to

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,480
get their prescriptions. That's a real

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,120
issue for me. We go undercover into the

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,920
black market of diabetes medication. I'm

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
on my way to buy a box of insulin pens.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,359
I really have no idea what I'm walking

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,600
into. Plus, dollar store beauty finds.

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,470
We'll show you what to avoid. Those are

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:40,240
red flags. Coming up next.

[Music]

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,600
What if the medication your life

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,760
depended on tripled in price seemingly

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,600
overnight? There's a lot of anger and

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,000
desperation as the prices of insulin

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,239
keep being hiked up, forcing frustrated

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,879
families across the country to make life

20
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,560
or death decisions, including buying

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,880
insulin on the black market. Today, an

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,760
undercover investigation into the black

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,470
market of diabetes medication. What are

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
you really buying?

25
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,600
[Music]

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,799
Insulin prices are skyrocketing, some

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,680
increasing by almost 600% over the last

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,680
decade. A vial of this essential

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,280
life-saving diabetes medicine selling

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,159
for around $35 in 2001 can now run

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,159
upwards of $250.

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,799
As insulin prices surge, so does the

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,079
black market. With private individuals

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,640
illegally reselling insulin online, I

35
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,520
see why buying this way is attractive.

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,600
Price differences are significant. The

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,320
average cost for a 100 units of one

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,799
brand is around $35.

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,159
But on a classified ad website, someone

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,320
was offering it for $100.

41
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,200
I wanted to find out who is doing this

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,960
and why. So, I began making purchasing

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,360
arrangements. I appreciate you getting

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,800
back to me so quickly. Most of the time,

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
they only want you to sell on the black

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,959
market. I don't want to do that. I want

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,280
to sell it to somebody that needs it.

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,760
Right off the bat, this supplier started

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,879
telling me why she had insulin to sell.

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,360
I got my prescription and I also sent

51
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,760
into the patient's assistance program

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,080
and they sent me 12 free. Oh, they under

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,920
a certain amount of money.

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,400
Throughout the seller kept talking

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,000
nervously about the black market. I

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,959
don't want the black market. I mean, I

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,280
hope it's kosher. And as my conversation

58
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,760
with this seller continued via email,

59
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,040
she became suspicious and the deal was

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,800
called off. Two other exchanges by email

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,480
and text did lead to meeting

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,560
arrangements.

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,000
And the next day, I prepared to go

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,319
undercover to buy insulin.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,319
I'm on my way to buy a box of insulin

66
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,040
pens. They would normally sell for about

67
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,120
$400. I'm expecting to pay about a

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,959
quarter of that. Now, I've only been in

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,879
touch with the seller online, so I

70
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,879
really have no idea what I'm walking

71
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,560
into. I don't know anything about this

72
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,920
person. I don't even know if it's a man

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,159
or a woman, and that's a little scary.

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,879
The seller communicated exclusively

75
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,959
through email, telling me to send an

76
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,000
email about 20 minutes prior to

77
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,400
arriving. I did, and after 10 minutes,

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,280
another communication. It will be a

79
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,080
black jacket with orange accents. Then

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,400
the seller arrived. Are you looking for

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,959
Angela? Hi, how are you?

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,000
As he rummaged around hunting for the

83
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,799
insulin, I asked a critical question.

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,720
But are they cold?

85
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,560
Cold.

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,480
They do have a white. You don't have to

87
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,920
in the fridge all the time though. Okay.

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,159
But I'm a little Do you mind if I just

89
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,159
take a look

90
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,879
on the bottom? The transaction felt

91
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,680
matterof fact, as if the seller had done

92
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,280
this countless times before. He headed

93
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,320
out with $125 and I had five insulin

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,079
pens in a sealed box. So, this is the

95
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,160
box that we just bought. I'm getting a

96
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,400
chance to take a look at it. It is still

97
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
sealed in original packaging. Couple

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,080
things that I'm noticing, though. This

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,160
looks to me like there was a

100
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
prescription label here. My guess is

101
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,880
that we are buying someone else's

102
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,800
prescription medicine.

103
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,120
As night fell, we headed to the next

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,880
meeting place to wait for another black

105
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,720
market insulin dealer. Are you looking

106
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,199
for Angela? Yeah. Hi. This next seller

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
was clearly all business. Is that just

108
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,120
one? Yeah. Okay. Do you mind if I take a

109
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,600
look at your inspiration? You package

110
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,680
perfectly. So, this is 140. Yeah. I

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,520
wanted to find out where this insulin

112
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,120
was coming from. Are you getting these

113
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,080
from like reputable places? Like only

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,520
Okay. I'm not going to worry about So

116
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,800
they're coming like from the pharmacy or

117
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,800
like they fell off a truck like

118
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,560
Okay. Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you. Have

119
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,280
a good one.

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,000
As the dealer left, my big question is,

121
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,080
"Is this insulin safe to use?"

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Up next, our investigation continues.

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,479
What did we uncover about the insulin

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,320
being sold on the black market? Plus,

125
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,199

your husband want to kill you? I'm worth

a lot more dead than I am alive. How she

132

foiled his plot. People are getting

poisoned all the time. They don't know

Insulin prices are skyrocketing. And as

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,600
the cost of this life-saving diabetes

142
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,919
medicine surges, so does the black

143
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,720
market, where private individuals

144
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,360
illegally resell insulin. I appreciate

145
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,280
you getting back to me so quickly. In my

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
investigation, I arranged to buy a box

147
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,400
of insulin pens that normally sell for

148
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,160
about $400, expecting to pay a quarter

149
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,240
of that.

150
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,479
I went undercover with hidden cameras,

151
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,960
hoping to find out more about how these

152
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,639
black market insulin dealers operate.

153
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,960
I've only been in touch with the seller

154
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,960
online. So, I really have no idea what

155
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,639
I'm walking into. I don't know anything

156
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,800
about this person. I don't even know if

157
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,919
it's a man or a woman, and that's a

158
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,199
little scary.

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,720
you?

161
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,800
The transaction felt matterof fact as if

162
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,400
the seller had done this countless times

163
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,639
before.

164
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,080
So, this is the box that we just bought.

165
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,479
I'm getting a chance to take a look at

166
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
it. It is still sealed in original

167
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,639
packaging. Couple things that I'm

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,880
noticing, though. This looks to me like

169
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,039
there was a prescription label here. My

170
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,080
guess is that we are buying someone

171
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,000
else's prescription medicine.

172
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,080
That was our undercover investigation of

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,840
black market diabetes drugs. Join me

undercover investigation. Thank you.

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,360
dealing with those guys about the black

182
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,000
market in diabetes meds? I was really

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,400
surprised at how easy this was. It took

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,840
us just minutes to find multiple sellers

185
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,759
and we were able to set up buying

186
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,520
arrangements immediately. It frankly

187
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,160
would have been harder for a minor to

188
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,919
buy alcohol than it was for us to buy

189
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,919
insulin on the black market. And just

190
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,840
get the pricing right. You these are the

191
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,520
actual items you bought. Yes. Right. So

192
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,919
you got, you know, this one you said was

193
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,599
$125. 25 for the first one. And you can

194
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,960
actually even you the prescription was

195
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,319
ripped off here, but you can see the

196
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,759
actual prices here. It says $391. $391.

197
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,840
So that's what the pharmacy is supposed

198
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,120
to sell it for. We got it for 125.

199
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,479
That's a significant savings. And there

200
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
as you did your research on the

201
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,879
undercover market, there were some

202
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,199
dangerous things you identified. You

203
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,400
highlighted one when you started pushing

204
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,080
that guy about how it was stored. What

205
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,959
were the red flags? Yeah, as you well

206
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,919
know, how insulin is stored is a very

207
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,039
big deal. When he showed up, he had this

208
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,560
underneath a garden hose in his backpack

209
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,320
and I asked him about the temperature

210
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,680
because there was no cooler, no ice pack

211
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,839
inside. He says, "Don't worry, it's been

212
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,279
in the freezer." Dr. Oz, it says on the

213
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,720
box, "Do not freeze." Yeah. I'm sure.

214
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,720
She says that literally on this box

215
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,640
right here, do not freeze the

216
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,240
instructions for handling. And this is a

217
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,399
life-saving medicine. So, it's scary to

218
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,720
think that people are relying on sources

219
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,720
like this as their supplier. Yeah, this

220
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,920
is this isn't magic fluid, guys. This is

221
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,360
insulin. It's got to be treated the

222
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,279
right way. Dr. Levby, what happens if

223
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,760
you freeze this insulin? Yeah. So, it

224
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,839
loses its potency and effectively is no

225
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,320
longer effective. So, someone might, if

226
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,920
they purchase prefrozen insulin, have

227
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,399
insulin that is no longer effective and

228
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,160
they've just paid $125 for it. explain

229
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,480
to everyone what what does that mean? So

230
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,640
for someone with diabetes who does not

231
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
take their insulin appropriately or is

232
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,959
not using effective insulin, what can

233
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,519
occur are very elevated blood sugars.

234
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,440
For some people with type 2 diabetes,

235
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,959
which is the adult type of diabetes,

236
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
that could be a few weeks and they'd be

237
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,240
in real trouble. Severely high blood

238
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,480
sugars at a point where they'd need to

239
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,880
go into emergency room. For someone who

240
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,480
requires insulin to stay alive, that

241
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,160
could mean within a week that person

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,640
could be in the emergency room and

243
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
possibly die. So freezing is one way you

244
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
might end up in this not even realizing

245
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,720
that the stuff doesn't work. What are

246
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,560
the other risks you worry about as an

247
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,399
endocrinologist if I buy insulin on the

248
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,560
black market because I am going to save

249
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,880
twothirds of my money maybe more. Right?

250
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,040
So the the concerns are severalfold.

251
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,560
Number one, you are very careful

252
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,320
consumer when you went in there to

253
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,640
purchase this but people could sell the

254
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,399
wrong type of insulin to to a patient.

255
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,240
For example, certain brands of insulin

256
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,160
come in a regular version, a mixed

257
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
version with different dilluent and

258
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,120
different features of it. So, what does

259
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
that mean? Is you might think you're

260
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,160
buying a certain insulin, but you're

261
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,240
actually buying a different one, which

262
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,399
could be very dangerous for you to

263
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,760
utilize if you were using the wrong one.

264
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,200
Now, you have your insulin pump. I just

265
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,959
noticed as you walked in here. Yes, that

266
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,680
is correct. Is there anything would ever

267
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,760
get you to buy uh a black market

268
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,079
insulin? So, that's a really interesting

269
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,640
question. The answer is I have health

270
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,519
insurance right now. So, the chances are

271
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,320
that I could have a prescription covered

272
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
by my insurance. This is a fear that I

273
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
always have. What if we lose our

274
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,160
insurance? What if I don't have a way to

275
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,079
get insulin? And of course, if I had to,

276
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,440
I would buy insulin on the black market

277
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,120
if there was no other way for me to

278
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,120
afford it or get it. But there were

279
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,440
grave concerns about that. So, I wanted

280
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,720
to have an audience full of people who

281
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,079
had bought their insulin on the black

282
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,519
market. I probably could have filled the

283
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,440
audience, but you know what? You could

284
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,560
have. It's illegal to purchase

285
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
prescription medications from an

286
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,880
unauthorized dealer. So, I couldn't

287
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,880
invite you because you would have been

288
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,920
breaking the law by admitting that.

289
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,320
However, price gouging is not illegal. I

290
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,240
have learned. Up next, why is the price

291
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,040
of insulin so high? We investigate

292
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,040
what's really going on.

293
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:27,519
[Music]

294
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,360
Comedian Jay Leno pays us a house call.

295
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,040
They've recently found that laughter is

296
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,279
not the best medicine. In fact, it

297
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,600
doesn't work at all. But get serious

298
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,399
about his own health. High cholesterol

299
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,680
just hits you. You don't know as much as

300
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,640
Jay can anyway.

301
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,040
That's coming up on Wednesday.

302
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,800
My son was diagnosed with diabetes 3

303
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,279
years ago.

304
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,440
Since then, we have lost our homes.

305
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,600
We've had to move out of state. We've

306
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,839
had cars repossessed.

307
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,079
We've had to choose whether we eat or if

308
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,480
we buy his life-saving medication.

309
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,480
Because of the high cost of insulin,

310
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,399
we're forced to share my insulin

311
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,360
prescription to try to keep us both

312
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,519
healthy. Having to choose between

313
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,079
keeping your child alive and paying the

314
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,480
bills is an absolutely heartbreaking

315
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,800
decision. But it's not like we have a

316
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,519
choice because without insulin, my

317
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,320
diabetic 12-year-old daughter will most

318
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,839
certainly die. Now, the price of insulin

319
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,839
is steadily rising, right? It's

320
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,519
increasing. Price gouging is not

321
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,600
illegal, but buying insulin on the black

322
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,519
market is. Keep that in mind. Now, there

323
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,440
have been protests over the skyrocketing

324
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,040
prices of insulin, and Washington is

325
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,959
starting to investigate. Just recently

326
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,320
they grilled pharmaceutical companies

327
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,320
about the high cost. And the big

328
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,920
question I want to know about insulin is

329
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,800
why is a medication that has been around

330
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,320
for almost a hundred years not gone down

331
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,120
in price. Well, you think that would

332
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,880
happen over after 100 years. Instead, it

333
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,440
seems like the opposite. The prices

334
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,839
actually have gone up. Marso who's been

335
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,279
investigating this is back. The cost of

336
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,079
insulin it seems like it's doubled.

337
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,839
That's the numbers that I've been

338
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,680
seeing. Doubled in five years. What's

339
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,040
really behind the rising cost? Yeah,

340
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,720
there are a few things that are going

341
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,240
on. So, first is that there are only

342
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,639
three companies in the United States

343
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,079
that make insulin and they can set the

344
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,320
price and there are no limits and

345
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,360
there's no regulation on what that price

346
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,920
is or how high it can go. The other

347
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,160
thing is insurance policies. We have

348
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,680
wildly different insurance policies in

349
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,839
this country. So, if you're someone with

350
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,600
diabetes with a very high deductible,

351
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
you have to pay out of pocket until you

352
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,440
reach that deductible. And even then,

353
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,760
the insurance company may only pay a

354
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,279
portion of the cost of the drug. So the

355
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,880
consumer is really bearing a lot of

356
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,920
these costs and just a couple things

357
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,519
here. First of all, it's a very

358
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,720
complicated relationship between the

359
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,399
different people in the healthcare

360
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,079
field. Maybe for a reason because it

361
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,200
makes it complicated for us to follow.

362
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,360
But in fact, according to a recent

363
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,639
study, insurance co-pays are higher than

364
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,760
the actual cost of the drug 25% of the

365
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,040
time. You need to ask you pay the cay

366
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
actually being more than what the actual

367
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
drug would cost on its own. And the

368
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,680
pharmaceutical companies are blaming the

369
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,880
insurance companies. So they're going

370
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,760
back and forth. And that lack of

371
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,560
transparency has allowed a lot of behind

372
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,399
the closed door deals. What are these?

373
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,920
These worry me a lot. Yeah. So, there's

374
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,760
essentially a negotiation that's going

375
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,360
on between the drug manufacturer, the

376
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,680
pharmacy benefit manager, and the

377
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,440
pharmacies about the price. But all of

378
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,440
that is shrouded in mystery. The

379
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,279
consumer is kept in the dark. They have

380
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,040
no idea why they're being charged what

381
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,440
they're being charged or how they came

382
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,199
up with those prices. There's a a lack

383
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,240
of transparency here. That's why the

384
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,839
show is important because if you

385
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,120
understand you can get upset at the

386
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,199
right people and once they know you're

387
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,199
on to them, people start reacting. So,

388
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,480
Dr. Lever, you have type 1 diabetes,

389
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,399
correct? You take care of people with

390
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,079
diabetes, which makes you especially

391
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,680
good at answering this question. What

392
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,680
worries you the most about the rising

393
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,399
the seeming rising cost of insulin?

394
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,600
Yeah. So, it it becomes the cost. Can

395
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,600
patients afford to pay for the

396
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,000
medication that they need to stay alive?

397
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,720
That's my biggest concern. The secondary

398
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,639
concern I have is that if people can't

399
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,240
afford it, they start rationing it. They

400
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,079
say, "Okay, which is better than not

401
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
taking it." But if you start to ration

402
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,519
it, that means you take half of your

403
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,040
appropriate dose of medication. That

404
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,199
leads to longer term risks,

405
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,360
complications of diabetes, eye disease,

406
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,880
kidney disease, nerve damage. You think

407
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
about every problem that someone could

408
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,279
have diabetes related, they're setting

409
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,040
theirelves up for that. So it's very

410
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,240
scary. So, we reached out to the

411
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,320
pharmaceutical research and

412
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,160
manufacturers of America and they

413
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,480
realized that there's a problem and they

414
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,720
aggressively dispute that the high

415
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,240
prices are because of them. They told us

416
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,079
there's a I'm quoting them robust

417
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,160
competition. So, they provide discounts

418
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,920
and rebates on insulin. But listen

419
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,560
carefully, those rebates are not being

420
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,920
passed along to the patients. They said

421
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,680
in part, "Unfortunately, patients

422
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,600
typically do not benefit from the fruits

423
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,680
of the competitive marketplace because

424
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,839
the price they pay at the pharmacy set

425
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,240
by their insurer is tied to the

426
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,839
undisounted list price." They go on to

427
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,680
say, "This is because middlemen are

428
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,440
gaining a profit by including these

429
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,120
medicines and health plan deductibles

430
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,160
that would expose patients to

431
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,399
undisounted prices."

432
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,000
Lots of things going on here, guys. if

433
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,759
they're pay, you know, giving little

434
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,040
discounts to make prices affordable for

435
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,079
consumers and consumers aren't getting

436
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,399
it and someone's pocketing the

437
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,839
difference. That's a real issue for me.

438
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,000
And the fact that you don't understand

439
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,600
the system is not an accident. You don't

440
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,880
understand for a reason because they

441
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,079
don't want you to understand because if

442
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,920
you don't understand it, you can't fix

443
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,440
it. So, this is a good opportunity for

444
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,959
us because it's not just insulin here.

445
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
It's a lot of the drugs that are

446
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
potentially saving or changing your

447
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,320
lives. Dr. Levy, when someone is in your

448
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,160
office talking to you about this stuff

449
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,639
and you know they cannot afford insulin,

450
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,120
what do you tell them? Yeah. So there

451
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,600
are some alternatives to offer. There's

452
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,079
one um foundation called Insulin for

453
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,320
Life and they do provide for people in

454
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,399
need options for insulin that's well

455
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,560
prepared, well stored that people c can

456
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,920
reach out for. The other opportunities

457
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,759
are alternative or older insulins, ones

458
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,079
that are not routinely used nowadays,

459
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,279
which one can still purchase in

460
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,040
variousarmacies for about $25 a vial.

461
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,880
They're not old. Yeah, they're not

462
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,040
ancient. They're just they were invented

463
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,959
a while back. Yeah, they were invented

464
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,640
longer ago than the current insulins

465
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,520
that are the most invogue and utilized

466
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,839
the most. So there are alternatives, but

467
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,079
those have to be carefully managed under

468
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,760
the supervision of a a physician because

469
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,039
they're dose differences. If you were to

470
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,799
switch and say, "Okay, I can't afford

471
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,760
this." You need someone to guide you how

472
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,439
to switch from insulin A to insulin B in

473
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,039
a safe fashion. Right? There are

474
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,199
companies including my trusted

475
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,880
sponsorship partners ShareCare that have

476
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,400
an app which allows you to compare

477
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,080
insulin prices in your area's

478
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,240
pharmacies. You may be able to find a

479
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,120
better deal. Educate yourself. Mara,

480
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,480
nice job going undercover. Dr. Levy Liz,

481
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,080
if we don't fix the problem of rising

482
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,760
insulin costs, we're going to have more

483
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,440
dangers of people buying frozen or

484
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,960
ineffective insulin. If you're taking

485
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,120
insulin, ask your doc if you can use one

486
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,039
of the older, cheaper types. They can be

487
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,640
just as effective without risking your

488
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,770
life buying insulin on the black market.

489
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,910
It is not worth it. We'll be right back.

490
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,910
[Music]

491
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,320
Up next, we investigate what's really in

492
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,559
beauty products you buy at the dollar

493
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,200
store. Is it a true beauty bargain?

494
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,360
Hello, Dr. Oz. It's Dr. Whitney. I'm

495
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,520
here in New York City. I'm actually at a

496
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,440
dollar store and I'm doing a little

497
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,360
investigation. I'm looking at different

498
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,120
beauty products for the skin, the hair,

499
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,799
the nails. I want to see which ones are

500
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,960
safe to get and which ones may not be

501
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,000
worth the bargain. We certainly don't

502
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,360
want to put our health at risk. So, I am

503
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,520
loading up my basket here and I will let

504
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,200
you know what I find.

505
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,039
Today, we're investigating dollar store

506
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,679
beauty products. Dermatologist Whitney

507
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,280
Bow is here with what she's uncovered. I

508
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,440
never knew there were so many beauty

509
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,960
products at these dollar stores. I'm How

510
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,679
many products can there be for hair and

511
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,480
skin in a dollar store? Yeah, I found a

512
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,160
surprisingly large variety of beauty

513
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,720
products at the dollar store. I found

514
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,960
products ranging from eye shadow to

515
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,160
makeup remover. There was hair dye,

516
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,400
shampoo, there was body lotion, shaving

517
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,400
cream. I even found face masks. So, how

518
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,919
does the dollar store actually do that?

519
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,679
These products are sort of expensive in

520
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,440
general. How can you get it to a dollar?

521
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
Is it really a dollar? As you might

522
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
suspect, first of all, some of them are

523
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,720
made on the cheap. You know, some of

524
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,880
them are made using maybe not the

525
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,200
highest quality ingredients, right? But

526
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,960
there are a few gems if you know what to

527
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,080
look for. And that's an excellent point.

528
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
You know, when I was looking around the

529
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,440
dollar store, not everything costs a

530
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,000
dollar. You know, some of them range all

531
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,520
the way up to $4,5.99.

532
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,440
But I think in general, the way that

533
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,280
these stores are able to keep the prices

534
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,200
so low is that they're basically

535
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,200
stocking up on brands that don't have

536
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,840
that name recognition, right? You're not

537
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,240
paying for that brand name and you're

538
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,720
not paying for the marketing campaign

539
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,160
behind that very well recognized brand

540
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,080
name, but you're also not getting the

541
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,200
trust, which is why I'm curious because

542
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,720
I thought there probably some things

543
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,559
that are worth getting, some that are

544
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,000
not. So, we look at all the dollar store

545
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,960
beauty products and Dr. Bo is going to

546
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,480
tell us if they're a pick or a pass so

547
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,640
you can still take advantage of these

548
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,559
deals. My go-to test is here to try out

549
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,559
the first item which is trending all

550
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,600
over the internet. Hello. Hello. These

551
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,919
are these blending sponges. I'll admit

552
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
this. I don't actually get a lot of hair

553
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,039
and makeup. At least I in my life I

554
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,160
hadn't until I started the show. Now 10

555
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,400
years later, I'm getting a little better

556
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,679
at it. But I see some artists using

557
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
these little bundle. I thought they were

558
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,240
the cool little toys initially and they

559
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,320
start putting their toys on my face. So,

560
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,799
have you used these before? Well, yeah.

561
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,120
I mean, these are all the rage when you

562
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,039
want to get that makeup on. Right. So,

563
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,480
these things can be pretty pricey in in

564
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,640
regular stores. Yeah. Yeah. know they

565
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,320
can cost up to $25 at, you know, certain

566
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,520
beauty stores. So, you know, looking

567
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,799
here, we're not telling you, Ranata,

568
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,320
which one is the $25 one versus which

569
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,000
one's the dollar one at the dollar

570
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,320
store, but if you're looking, I mean,

571
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
quite honestly, it's almost impossible

572
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,280
to tell them apart, right? They both

573
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,400
have very similar shapes. You want to

574
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,760
take that one, you can take that one.

575
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,200
I'll give you that one. They have very

576
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,600
similar shapes, you know? They're made

577
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,679
of very similar feel the material. very

578
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,600
similar material to give you that

579
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,200
flawless finish that you're looking for,

580
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,720
right? So, yeah. First, you want to get

581
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,799
them wet. So, you want to do it with me?

582
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,480
So, we'll get them wet. You want to wet

583
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,320
them first and then you give it a good

584
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
squeeze. So, you you want to get it damp

585
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,960
and then what you do is you take So,

586
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,360
it's got two different ends, right? Take

587
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,320
the the wider or broader end. You want

588
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,480
to dab it in the foundation there. And

589
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,760
then you're going to instead of using

590
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,000
the way that you would use your fingers

591
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,400
or a brush, you sort of wipe this. You

592
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,440
want to press the makeup into the skin.

593
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,440
So, is it okay if I if I demo? Okay, you

594
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,200
got it. Don't get too high. Now, what

595
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,360
you want to do is you want to use like a

596
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,080
a bouncing a tapping a dabbing motion to

597
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,039
actually press that makeup into the

598
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,520
skin. I I punching motion. I like that

599
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,080
idea. A punching motion. I didn't say

600
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,360
punching. She's like a sister. I don't

601
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,520
remember that. Let me get you. Let me

602
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,559
get you one. You can use that bird's

603
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,760
side. Ow.

604
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,280
She did that on purpose.

605
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,280
And what's the side? What's the pointed

606
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,960
part for? It shouldn't be dangerous. Um,

607
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,559
so yeah. So the pointed part gets into

608
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,559
those hard to reach places like the

609
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,559
sides of your nose or underneath your

610
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,360
eye. Yeah. You want to get in the

611
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,679
corners. Oh, sharp. Exactly. No, it's

612
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,679
not. I'm not hurting you. Right there.

613
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah. All right. So, both both design.

614
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,880
You apply them to yourself. You just

615
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,919
compare these two. Which one do you

616
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,919
think is better? Is there a difference,

617
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,000
first of all? Yeah. The purple and the

618
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,080
the green one. These are the same

619
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,200
company and this is one. So, which which

620
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,400
is which is which? So, this is the $25

621
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,400
and that is the dollar. Oh, I like

622
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,320
those.

623
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,360
Almost impossible. So, the beauty blend

624
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,600
sponge is a pick. Is that Absolutely.

625
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,159
Nice job. That'll save some money. $25

626
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,880
versus one. That's a Now, next. How

627
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,320
about these? The dollar store face

628
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,679
masks. I've been seeing these things.

629
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,200
They're huge trenders. You know, I was

630
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,960
in airport. I saw a lady walking around

631
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,799
the airport with one, but now they've

632
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
been in, you know, grocery stores,

633
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,919
planes. There's actually these are real

634
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,720
pictures posted about. So, Britney, what

635
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,400
do you think about these? What

636
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,559
ingredients did you find? Well, so in

637
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,080
the masks that I found at the dollar

638
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,120
store, they actually contained an

639
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,320
ingredient that was named allergen of

640
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,320
the year in 2004 because it caused so

641
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
many cases of skin inflammation and

642
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,640
irritation. So, the name of the

643
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,400
ingredient is cocamopropylane.

644
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,080
You say that. Say it three times. Oh, I

645
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
got it. Cocoamopropyl Betane. Oh my

646
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,200
gosh, she actually got that. I mean, my

647
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,559
name is so I have to get Whoa, that was

648
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,480
amazing. So, cocamopropylane is a

649
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,880
detergent. So, it it's what sort of

650
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,039
gives like body lotions or body washes

651
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,919
or shampoos that sort of foamy rich

652
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,559
bubbly lather. And unfortunately, in

653
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,320
this mask, cocamopropylane was listed as

654
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,159
the third ingredient on the ingredient

655
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,000
list. So, it's in there in a pretty high

656
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,240
concentration. So, for me, guys, that's

657
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,679
those are red flags, right? So this this

658
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,799
the dollar store face masks they're a

659
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,760
pass because you got to be sure that

660
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,679
what's in there is what you want to have

661
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,600
in your face. No no cocoa purple but

662
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:55,039
tank. Okay. Oh god. Gosh.

663
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,880
You awesome. I love showoffs. I just

664
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,280
fantastic. Three years of residency to

665
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,799
get that down. All that tuition. I

666
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,880
wasted four years of med school for

667
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,640
nothing. All right. Dollar store

668
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,840
foundation. Is it a pick or a pass?

669
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,280
We're not the thoughts on this. Would

670
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,880
you try a foundation that you bought at

671
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,480
a dollar store? No. to think that the

672
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,799
dollar store might have something that's

673
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,559
good enough to go all over this space.

674
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,640
Okay.

675
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,120
And not irritated million dollar.

676
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,360
Exactly. Hello. So, Dr. W, you you

677
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,640
examined this Dr. B. I did. I took a

678
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,840
look at all of these and you know, as a

679
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,960
dermatologist, I'm trained to sort of

680
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,640
look at the ingredients, you know, which

681
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,480
ones are going to clog pores.

682
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,960
Unfortunately, your instincts were

683
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,200
correct, RA. Even more worrisome than

684
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,360
that, is it possible that this bottle is

685
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,840
sitting in a hot warehouse somewhere,

686
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,600
you know, for days or weeks, and if so,

687
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,840
it can turn this bottle into a petri

688
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,120
dish and grow up a whole bunch of germs.

689
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,159
So, yeah, I I would Dr. Come over here.

690
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,840
I made a little illustration to make

691
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,520
sure this really sinks in for everybody.

692
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,840
So, I made you all a massive bottle of

693
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,600
foundation. There it is, your

694
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,960
foundation. Right. Now, in some cases,

695
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,799
you pointed out, it could be sitting in

696
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,480
a warm warehouse for we don't know how

697
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,000
long. Right. Right. And over time, what

698
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,919
happens is the combination of the warmth

699
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,600
plus the liquid base of the foundation

700
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,240
can provide a perfect breeding ground

701
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,840
for bacteria. And those purpley bacteria

702
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,120
grow in there. You can't tell, right?

703
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,400
Some of them might irritate you, some

704
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,919
you can get away with, but why take a

705
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,440
chance at something that Renata said,

706
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,039
you have million-dollar faces, don't put

707
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,480
a cheap foundation on there. So, the

708
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,080
dollar store foundation is a pass. Not a

709
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,240
pass. Coming up, the dollar store beauty

710
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,000
bargains that makeup artists and

711
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,440
dermatologists like I could both swear

712
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,640
by. Right? You love these things. They

713
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,640
can be spilling their secrets. Stick

714
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,640
around.

715
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:38,159
[Applause]

716
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,159
I love getting to talk with you on my

717
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,400
show every single day, but when the

718
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,720
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

719
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,720
is not over. I still have a lot that I

We are back investigating dollar store

724
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,559
beauty products. I asked makeup artists

725
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,320
and dermatologists to spill their

726
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,080
ultimate beauty secrets that you can buy

727
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,760
at the dollar store. Dermatologist

728
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,279
Whitney Bo is back along with my go-to

729
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,039
tester.

730
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,600
Their first dollar store beauty secret

731
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,120
to stock up on is shimmering eyeshadow.

732
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,120
Why do you like the shimmering eyeshadow

733
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,559
at dollar stores? I love shimmering

734
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,159
eyeshadow at dollar store cuz you can

735
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:23,200
easily transform it into a shimmering

736
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,960
body lotion. So, it's great for that

737
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,640
girls night out if you just want a

738
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
little extra sparkle, a little extra

739
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,600
glow. And if you go online or you go to

740
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,360
the department store, you know,

741
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,960
shimmering body oil, shimmering body

742
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,200
lotions, they can range from 20 to $50

743
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,880
for a small tube. So, this is such a

744
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,400
great way to save a couple bucks. So,

745
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,520
how do we make it? What do you So easy.

746
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,440
So, what you want to do is you want to

747
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,440
start with your favorite lotion. Take a

748
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,760
couple pumps, put that into a jar. You

749
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,799
know, I'm using a glass jar here. And

750
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,080
then, this is why you don't want to

751
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,520
spend a lot of money on the shimmering

752
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,960
eyeshadow part. You're going to take

753
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,480
that eye shadow. You can either use

754
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,679
bronze, you can use like a pearly white,

755
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,520
depending on if you're going for sort of

756
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,760
like a a bronzy glow or a little bit of

757
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,480
a highlight or shimmer. And what you do

758
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,080
is you take a fork.

759
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,279
A fork and make sure you got a piece of

760
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,520
paper underneath. I thought you're

761
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,960
putting it on your skin. So, wait. The

762
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,240
first step is you're going to collect

763
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,240
you're going to you're going to break

764
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,320
down some of those particles. kind of

765
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,640
collect them onto your piece of paper

766
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,960
and then you use that like a funnel and

767
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,720
you basically collect it and then you

768
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,559
get it into your lotion. Stir that

769
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,320
around. We actually premixed two

770
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,120
different ones for you so you can try it

771
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,320
out. And you basically then just apply

772
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,559
that to your arms, your legs. You can

773
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,559
put some on your cheekbone as a little

774
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,159
highlighter on your collar bone when you

775
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,320
mix in in the uh it does and it breaks

776
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,840
it down. It's a very subtle glow. It

777
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,760
gives you a subtle shimmer. No, I

778
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,400
wouldn't use dollar store eyeshadow on

779
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,480
my face every day, right? But once a

780
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,080
month for that special night out if you

781
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,720
want to have that beautiful shimmering

782
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:57,000
body. I'm shimmering. I'm shimmering.

783
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,000
Very subtle. What do you think?

784
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,440
This is awesome, right? Isn't this

785
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,240
great? Let me tell you why. If I want to

786
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,080
fake a a beach uh photo shoot, this is

787
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,919
what I need right here. Some body

788
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,080
shimmering from the dollar store instead

789
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,080
of spending $50.

790
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,840
Exactly. That's it. All right. Next tip

791
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,360
comes from the makeup artist who does

792
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,399
the glam for Beyonce and the

793
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,600
Kardashians. Take a look. Hey guys, I'm

794
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,679
here to share with you a couple of

795
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,720
dollar store beauty products that are a

796
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,880
must to stock up on. The first one is

797
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,399
hair conditioner. Hair conditioner is a

798
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,240
great alternative to shaving cream if

799
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,320
you're ever in a pinch. What you want to

800
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,640
do is pour out the conditioner, lather

801
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,080
on your legs, and shave like normal. It

802
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,960
is a great beauty bargain that will

803
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,559
leave your legs feeling soft and smooth.

804
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,320
Okay. Next, if you're looking to

805
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,240
moisturize and give your lips a little

806
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,480
bit of color, get yourself some dollar

807
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,320
store chapstick and make an awesome lip

808
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,640
tip. What I personally like to do is get

809
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,960
a makeup palette like so. And I've

810
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
crushed my favorite blush. And here's a

811
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,960
dollar store chapstick, which I mixed

812
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,039
both of them in the middle.

813
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,120
I applied with the back of my finger.

814
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,440
And as you can tell, I have a nice flush

815
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,440
of color that looks natural and it's so

816
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,200
inexpensive.

817
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
The next beauty bargain can give you a

818
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,880
fiveinut manicure. Five minutes. They're

819
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,399
called nail stickers. Why do you like

820
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,679
these more than those gel manicures I

821
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,200
see everyone using these days? I mean, I

822
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,559
know why gel manicures are so popular,

823
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,039
right? They're they give you that

824
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,960
durability, that longl lasting wear, and

825
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,960
they give you that incredible shine. But

826
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,720
my patients who do gel manicure after

827
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,159
gel manicure, you know, eventually your

828
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,679
nails are thin and they're weak and

829
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,559
they're brittle. So, I say, you got to

830
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,480
take a nail salon holiday. You got to

831
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,640
take a break. But most my patients don't

832
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,039
want to go without some kind of, you

833
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,120
know, bling,

834
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,080
some kind of polish. So, nail stickers

835
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,080
or little decals. So much fun. A great

836
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,279
alternative. Okay. Are they tattoos?

837
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,799
What are they? How do they work? Yeah.

838
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,480
So, what you do is first you want to

839
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,000
take you want to just take like some

840
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,600
scissors and you just cut around the way

841
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,880
that See how these are cut into little

842
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,240
little You don't have to worry about

843
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,559
getting it perfectly around there

844
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,559
because you're going to be putting it in

845
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,799
water anyway. They come with this little

846
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,559
plastic sort of coating on top. So, you

847
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,080
want to take that off. You can use some

848
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,760
tweezers if you want to get a little

849
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,679
extra fine motor control, Dr. Oz. And

850
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,880
then the the here. So, if you guys see

851
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,320
my little sticker here, what I'm going

852
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,600
to do is I'm going to wave this in the

853
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,600
water because you want to get it really

854
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,039
wet. So, that's the trick. And all these

855
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,320
these stickers work differently. Some of

856
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,399
them do work more like temporary

857
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,399
tattoos. These, the best way to do these

858
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,000
is you get them really, really wet. And

859
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,600
then you want to take your finger, do

860
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,279
this with me, Renata. Let's see if we

861
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,279
can do it. And you want to try to

862
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,559
actually press them and glide them off.

863
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,480
So, I don't know if you can see that.

864
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,600
Mine came right off. And then you want

865
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,200
to press it onto a clean, dry nail. So,

866
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,120
here's where your tweezers might come in

867
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,760
if you're not able to get. And can you

868
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,080
guys see that on my nail? Yes. Right.

869
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,200
So, then Very nice, Sakra. We're

870
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,159
matching. Oh, fabulous. That's easy.

871
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
Very nice. Simple. What do you think

872
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,720
about it? Cheers with our little nail

873
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,200
stickers. Amazing. I love it. I love

874
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,840
this cuz I'm not one to actually wear

875
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,000
nail polish, but to do these stickers

876
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,000
every now and then on my fingers without

877
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,679
having to, you know, get chipped because

878
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,440
of the nail polish along. Exactly. This

879
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,200
is awesome. I like these. So much fun.

880
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,720
Yeah,

881
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,919
I got to say I'm going to start wearing

882
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,279
these. I like these. I'm going to

883
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,080
impress my daughters, guys. Thank you

884
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,080
very much. We'll be right back.

885

you with home remedies? They do. I'm

899
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,200
like everybody's mama. Like I was raised

900
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,360
by this southern black lady and my

901
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,679
grandmother was awesome. I'm like Nana

902
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,840
Remix. Okay.

903
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,200
So why do you love witch hazel so much?

904
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,559
I love witch hazel because it's

905
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,760
something that everybody has. It's

906
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,320
something everyone knows how to use.

907
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,480
It's super cheap and like why not? Like

908
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,840
we need to use this. So show me a hack

909
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,200
that you've been talking about and I've

910
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,799
been hearing about with regard to

911
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,880
makeup. Yeah. So you know I'm 34 but I

912
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,640
need to make sure. Thank you.

913
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,960
But I got I have to make sure that I'm

914
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,360
able to maintain this face. So when I'm

915
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,480
using this, I always use two tablespoons

916
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,640
of water, two tablespoons of olive oil.

917
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,240
I like olive oil better just than any

918
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,159
other oil cuz it's natural. You use on

919
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,080
your skin, you use your hair. It's like,

920
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,640
look at this. You see this glow? I do

921
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,600
like the glow. Nice. Right. And then the

922
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,360
two tablespoons of the um the witch

923
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,440
hazel. So you're just going to mix it

924
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,120
up. So you're making a makeup remover

925
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,360
for me. Absolutely. This is something

926
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,519
that you will buy in a store and it's

927
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,960
actually going to be like 30 40 bucks.

928
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,279
These ingredients probably cost you

929
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,960
three bucks. It seems too good to be

930
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,399
true, doesn't it? To save all that kind

931
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,320
of money. Do you mind if I just

932
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,519
absolutely trust but verify here?

933
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,720
Please. All right. So, I'm I got a

934
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,440
little bit here. Who's interested in

935
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,799

got a victim right over here. Here.

for your honeymoon. Well, we've been uh

969
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,320

to New York and then we're going to

971
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,079
finish up with Disneyland. Well, New

972
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,599

973
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,359

Oh my goodness. I love honeymoons.

985
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,359
I don't know about you guys.

986
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,280
Part of the reason I love the covenant

987
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,640
of of of marriage is it's the best thing

988
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,400
I ever did in my life. Jay is getting

989
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,000
married. So without question, nothing

990
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,079
even close. Yeah. Yeah. That's

991
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,520
beautiful. I'm glad to hear that. I'm

992
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,040
sure you're going to get you there, too.

993
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,160
That's part of the show. This show is a

994
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,520
show's a dating service, by the way.

995
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,160
We're trying to Oh, I need a man. So,

996
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,599
let me let me know. We can put that on

997
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,400
my blog, too. I J a man. That's right.

998
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,920
After I watch facial with the wish. You

999
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,440
got one more little hack for us. Yeah.

1000
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,880
Which is to have to do with pimples. And

1001
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,880
this is actually said putting aspirin on

1002
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
a pimple which I know works. Yeah.

1003
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,000
Because I've heard about it but I've not

1004
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
seen it actually done. So please demo.

1005
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,240
Yeah. So I again my grandmother she

1006
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,160
showed me these things when I was young.

1007
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,880
I had you know a couple little little

1008
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,800
blemishes a little bit. Um, but I

1009
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,800
remember I had this one fashion show and

1010
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,480
I was so excited to be a part of it. And

1011
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,440
she was like, she's like, "Oh, you were

1012
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,280
going to dress you up. You're going to

1013
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,599
wear heels, you know." D. And I'm like,

1014
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,720
"Oh my god, Nana, I have a pimple on my

1015
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,000
face. What am I going to do? I can't

1016
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,440
walk in a fashion show with this huge

1017
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,280
huge thing on my face." She was like,

1018
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,800
"Girl, get some aspirin. It'll be fine."

1019
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,440
I'm like, "What am I going to do with

1020
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,920
some aspirin?" She's like, "Oh, just

1021
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,280
crush it up. Put it in a little powder

1022
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,760
on it." Take it like this with your

1023
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,240
spoon. Yeah. So then we're going to put

1024
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,280
it right between the two spoons and then

1025
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,480
just crush it up. And it's like not even

1026
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,760
that messy. If I can crush it. Yeah, you

1027
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,359
that's what I do. I think goes right on

1028
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,320
the spoon. Mess it up like that. And

1029
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,920
then what is this here? Just water. So

1030
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,680
yeah. So we'll put just a couple drops

1031
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,240
of water in it. And we want to make it

1032
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,560
into a nice little paste. So then we'll

1033
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,720
mix it up and then literally put it

1034
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,160
right on your skin. And you'll that's

1035
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,760
it. And you just leave it on the spot

1036
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,200
for at least 10 minutes. You don't want

1037
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,320
to put it any longer than that cuz then

1038
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,599
it'll dry out and you have a whole

1039
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,960
another problem. Yeah. Cuz you see this

1040
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,800
how it's a taste there. See guys,

1041
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,200
looking carefully and the nice thing is

1042
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,560
is it's an anti-inflammatory. So reduce

1043
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,480
the redness around the pimple and might

1044
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,640
help the pimple. Yeah. Yeah. I like

1045
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,560
this. I love it. Nice job. Thank you. I

1046
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,040
got one more surprise for everybody. We

1047
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,400
got bonus hacks at dr.com. But before we

1048
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,119
go to break one more hack that I really

1049
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,400
like a lot. We have been using band-aids

1050
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,280
wrong our entire lives. Watch this. It's

1051
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:39,680
going to change yours.

1052
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:41,839
[Music]

1053
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,839
This best-selling author claims her

1054
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,640
husband was poisoning her. I'm worth a

1055
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,480
lot more dead than I am alive.

1056
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,839
How she foiled his plot. People are

1057
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,400
getting poisoned all the time. They

1058
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:56,359
don't know it. All new.

1059
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,359
That's coming up tomorrow.

1060
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,079
Today, big news. In fact, breaking news

1061
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,839
about your heart. Is open heart surgery

1062
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,119
becoming a thing of the past? Well, we

1063
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,119
all know someone who's had that kind of

1064
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,400
invasive surgery with the the big cut in

1065
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,240
their front. It's made with a device

1066
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,320
like this that we use as heart surgeons

1067
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,720
to saw open the ribs and expose the

1068
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,040
heart. I grew up doing this. It's pretty

1069
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,800
invasive, but a big new study shows

1070
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,720
there may be a safer, easier way to

1071
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,880
treat one of the most common and serious

1072
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,280
conditions that can affect the valves of

1073
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,200
the heart. And guess what? 2 and a half

1074
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,800
million people in the US have this

1075
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,640
problem right now. It's called aortic

1076
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,240
stenosis. And here's what it looks like.

1077
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,599
There's the heart, right? Pounded away.

1078
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,440
And there's this big tube coming out of

1079
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,640
it that it carries blood to the rest of

1080
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,720
the biac, the brain, and the other

1081
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,880
organs. Inside the heart, the blood goes

1082
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,640
back and forth across this valve. But

1083
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,839
this valve which is importantly

1084
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,160
regulating the blood when you look at it

1085
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,560
from above opens up like a MercedesBenz

1086
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,320
sign. But if it gets stenotic, if it

1087
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,000
gets scarred in like this and get little

1088
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,680
piece of calcium on it, it can't work.

1089
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,680
So it makes it harder for the heart to

1090
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,040
push the blood out to your vital organs.

1091
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,400
You get symptoms when this happens

1092
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,079
because the heart's backing up. You

1093
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,200
start to faint because no blood's going

1094
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,640
to your brain. You have shortness of

1095
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,880
breath. The blood backs up in your

1096
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,280
lungs. And when it's severe, right, it

1097
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,839
can cause life-threatening issues. So

1098
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,520
about two decades ago, two innovative

1099
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,680
engineers, two cardiologists had an

1100
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,599
idea. What if we could fix this problem

1101
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,800
with only making a small incision in the

1102
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,640
groin and replace this valve with a

1103
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,400
catheter instead of using that saw that

1104
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,320
I used earlier? They asked me to help

1105
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,400
design the device and now a new clinical

1106
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,560
trial all these years later suggests

1107
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,599
that this treatment now it's called TAV

1108
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,119
or TAVR may become the best option for

1109
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,560
everyone. And I want to introduce you to

1110
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,040
my friend Dr. from Marty Leon.

1111
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,800
Martin actually he helped lead the

1112
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,400
development of the device and the tavern

1113
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,320
trial with Michael Mack and some great

1114
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,720
engineers both named Stan by the way the

1115
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,480
stands. So show everyone how this works

1116
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,640
and how much effort it took to make this

1117
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,320
happen. So you make a little cut in the

1118
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,000
groin and there's the catheter. The

1119
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,079
catheter goes up. We snake the catheter

1120
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
across the aorta. Then we cross the old

1121
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,880
valve here, the diseased valve. And then

1122
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,880
we expand the new valve. And you can see

1123
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,560
the new valve is expanded and now it

1124
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,560
works like a normal valve. And looking

1125
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,480
at it from above, you'll notice I showed

1126
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,560
earlier how it got scarred in. Now it's

1127
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,040
working normally. And one big idea here

1128
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,320
which actually very young doctors share

1129
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,760
with us was you don't have to take the

1130
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,520
old valve out. You can just actually

1131
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,839
push the old valve to the side. It's

1132
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,320
like mortar, right? Actually holds our

1133
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,240
new valve in place. So give us the

1134
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,079
summary of the results. This was front

1135
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,760
page news everywhere around the world.

1136
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,280
So this device, this technique was

1137
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,880
originally going to be used only for the

1138
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,520
patients who are very high risk for

1139
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,680
surgery. What we did was now the fifth

1140
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,440
randomized trial, but it's in low

1141
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,720
surgical risk patients, which is the

1142
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,359
majority of patients with aortic

1143
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,720
stenosis. What we learned was that after

1144
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,079
a year of following these patients,

1145
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,839
there a thousand patients in this

1146
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,760
clinical trial. You compare surgery

1147
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,720
versus TAVER, we learned that there was

1148
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,480
about a 50% reduction in death, stroke,

1149
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,319
and rehospization at the end of a year

1150
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,760
if you use the catheter system, the less

1151
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,520
invasive system. So, it's the best of

1152
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,440
both worlds. Exactly. Less invasive

1153
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,359
seems to work maybe even better. And

1154
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,599
listen, we don't have outcome past the

1155
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,040
year really. All right. In general, you

1156
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,319
don't have to wait 15 years to see if

1157
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,680
these valves will last as long as the

1158
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,599
old fashioned ones. But this is really

1159
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,440
good news for a lot of you. So, come on

1160
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,520
over here. Mery's joining us. She was

1161
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,200
part of the clinical trial. And you are

1162
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,880
brave to have done this. Let me hand

1163
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,920
that to you. That's what your valve

1164
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,160
looked like. Wow. So, what do you think?

1165
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,920
It's amazing. I never saw it. It's in

1166
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,520
there. It's This is actually Dr. The

1167
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,720
other is the exact same one you have in

1168
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,800
your body. What was it like being

1169
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,880
randomized in the trial? It was

1170
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,960
wonderful. I didn't know until three

1171
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,240
days before that I was going to be

1172
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,240
chosen or picked. Um and so I'm

1173
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,000
delighted because I had a friend that

1174
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,560
had um corona coronary disease and she

1175
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,880
had um open heart surgery and she has

1176
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,200
not been the same since. She's had

1177
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,760
complications. Mine was a wonderful

1178
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,599
experience. Well, as a surgeon, I've

1179
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,319
always believed part of my job, coming

1180
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,400
on over, was to put myself out of

1181
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,839
business. And the status quo wasn't good

1182
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,200
enough. You want mercies of the world

1183
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,640
bragging to their friends about how well

1184
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,680
they're doing. So, I've got all these

1185
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,720
young people, doctors, nurses. This is

1186
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,400
my point of my partners, by the way,

1187
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,319
Isaac George, working together to make

1188
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,319
these advances

1189
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,560
a reality. And my colleagues at the

1190
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,839
hospital, yes, you should think because

1191
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,240
it's the young folks that are changing

1192
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,920
medicine. Advanc is so quick, we barely

1193
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,240
keep up with it. Marty and I with our,

1194
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,160
you know, graying hair and years of

1195
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,440
work, it only hand the baton off, but it

1196
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,280
makes a huge difference because the

1197
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,720
bodies don't change, but technologies

1198
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,079
do. So, I want to congratulate all of

1199
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,839
you very much with the bottom of my

1200
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,920
heart, making this all possible. And

1201
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,520
congratulations to you, Marty, for never

1202
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,760
giving up, being persistent, having a

1203
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,560
lot of grit. Congrats to you as well.

1204
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,560
We'll see you all next time.
