00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,480
DJ Elvis Duran has always been very

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,399
candid with his audience. For years, he

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
shared his struggle with his weight. And

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,640
when I was at his radio show, we took

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,120
his blood pressure. That was the day

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
that would change his life forever.

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,160
Elvis, your real blood pressure, it was

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
165 over 110. So catastrophically high

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,399
that you have a chance of having a

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,480
stroke today.

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,879
Elvis underwent gastric sleeve surgery

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,039
in 2014.

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,680
I'll never forget the moment he walked

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,519
out on stage looking slim and trip,

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,000
smiling bigger than I've ever seen him

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,760
smile before. And ever since he's turned

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,840
things around, he's been paying it

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,520
forward and helping others. What advice

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,240
do you have for all of us trying to find

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,799
our happy place? It's literally just

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,960
figuring out what makes you happy. Two

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,119
years ago, Elvis took an important step

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,200
on his own road to happiness when he

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,479
came out of the closet with millions of

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,119
listeners. And now Elvis has taken the

41
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,759
ultimate step. This time down the aisle.

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,159
Just a few weeks ago, I was so proud to

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,200
watch as Elvis and the love of his life,

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,840
Alex Carr, tied the knot. The wedding

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,159
ceremony was about two people becoming

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,320
one. That actually that's faulty math.

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,159
The correct math is a magical math. It's

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,159
1 + 1 equals everything.

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,759
Please welcome radio host newlywed and

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,759
my good friend Elvis Durant.

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,039
No. Take it in. They love you. Thank

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,440
you.

53
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,040
Thank you. So happy you're here. Which

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,640
one? Hold on. You can say whatever you

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,160
want. All right. Oh my goodness. Are

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,319
these real? Can I eat these? Yes, please

57
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,920
do. Chew on them. Eat some flowers.

58
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,599
They're good for you. Kale flowers.

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,000
They're brand new. Oh god. Everything's

60
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,760
edible in the couch.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,239
It's good to be back. It's wonderful to

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,640
have you. I tell you, I watched you as a

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,000
close friend, but also admirer. Uh, and

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,239
when you got married this this past

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,239
weekend, it was very special because I

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,920
saw that culminate all the things you've

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,840
been doing for the last decade. But I

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,640
want to go back a 10-year period. Let's

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
just start for at a time where you were

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,360
in a very different place in your

71
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,720
personal life, very physically very

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,400
different, career-wise, in a different

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,920
spot. How did you get to where you are

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
now, where you're completely on top of

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,680
the world, and what catalyzed that

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,599
change? You know what? I think

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,760
the best moment of my life you just saw

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,280
on that piece before I came out is when

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,400
you you saved my life. You you saved my

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,400
life. And uh

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,000
I promise not to cry because tears have

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,680
salt and he tells us salt's very bad for

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,800
us.

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
You know, I I think you know what? For

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,680
the past 10 years, I've been getting to

86
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,599
know myself and uh and it's making a

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,200
huge difference. And now I have clarity.

88
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,280
Now I can see where I want to go for the

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,440
next however many millions of years I

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
have left. When I witch watched you walk

91
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,840
down the aisle, I I thought back to a

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,319
few years ago when it was not publicly

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,000
known that that you were gay, right? We

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,519
all your friends knew, but you weren't

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
talking about what what catalyzed your

96
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,840
decision to be truthful for to the

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,599
millions who adore you and listen to you

98
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,760
and trust the wisdom you share with

99
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,680
them. It was them. It was my audience.

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,840
You know, I I was doing a show every

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,280
day. And so, I wanted to better connect

102
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,040
with my audience. And there's no better

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,439
way to do that than to be honest and

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,599
say, "Hey, I'm a single gay guy living

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,599
in New York. I'm striking out, man. No

106
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,400
one wants to date me. The dating life

107
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,760
sucks. It's relatable. It's connecting."

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,920
And then I would have people write back

109
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
to me or text back and say, "I'm going

110
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
through the same thing." What's the

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,880
advice you would give to someone

112
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,199
watching right now who's where you were

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,199
10 years ago? Tons of potential, right?

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,360
but just not showing up in some of the

115
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,120
ways that are really important. Be aware

116
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
of the important things and try to brush

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
off the things that just don't matter.

118
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,880
So, by the way, you have me so nervous

119
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,639
right now. Can I just tell you guys it

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,199
was a week and a half ago he stood up at

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,080
my wedding and gave the best advice to

122
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,240
Alex and me and everyone in the audience

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
in the uh ceremony and I can't thank you

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
enough. Well, you kind of say how much

125
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,960
fun did we have? Did Did you see this

126
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,400
guy dancing? Did you show video of him

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,400
dancing at my wedding? Destroyed that.

128
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,000
My wife destroyed all the evidence. I've

129
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
never seen anyone cut the road. I'll

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,199
tell you, we we I actually posted with

131
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,040
seven steps, seven hacks for a happy

132
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
marriage. They weren't my ideas. I went

133
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,479
around and talked to a lot of friends

134
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
just to see what people who had been

135
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,840
together in relationship for a long

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,280
times had figured out. If I run into an

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,479
80-year-old couple who's been married 60

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,880
years and they're in a blissful

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,400
relationship, teach me how you did it. I

140
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,639
want to understand that. And what I

141
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,320
think you do so beautifully is you make

142
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,440
us comfortable. And Elvis writes about

143
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,720
in his book, by the absolutely

144
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,039
fantastic, and we'll be talking about a

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,360
little bit more. You have the ability to

146
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,360
to let people open. How how did you

147
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,759
develop that? That's actually what makes

148
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,039
your show to me most iconic. Well, it's

149
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,960
what you do every day and you watch them

150
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,759
every day. You're a master at making

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,520
people comfortable. I mean, if you make

152
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,720
your guest comfortable in your home,

153
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,320
they're going to have a good time. If I

154
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,280
make my guest comfortable on my show,

155
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,199
they're going to have a good time and

156
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,919
open up. You know, let me just want to

157
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,600
throw more salacious question. Okay, get

158
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,320
salacious. You want to get dirty? I want

159
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,639
to get this to it. What celeb interview?

160
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,600
What's Lebanon interview went off the

161
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,199
rails for you? I mean, just Okay, I

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,759
don't want to say the Madonna interview

163
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,199
was off the rails. I've done I've done

164
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,080
three or maybe four interviews with

165
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,199
Madonna. I never felt like I connected

166
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,400
with Madonna. I never felt like we had a

167
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
conversation about anything real. And I,

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,440
as it turns out, I've seen other Madonna

169
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,880
interviews and she doesn't really like

170
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,560
to give you a lot from the heart. So, I

171
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,319
want to redo I want to redo with

172
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,199
Madonna. I want to interview her until I

173
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,520
finally get to her heart and soul. I

174
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
mean, otherwise I'm I'm failing. I'm I'm

175
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,280
not connected. So, Madonna, if you're

176
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,199
watching, here's a rose for you. It's

177
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,120
two for you. I want you to speak to

178
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,319
Elvis again. Allow him to open your

179
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,680
heart so we can all see it better. Is

180
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,280
that a deal? Deal. I'm sure she's

181
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,120
watching. I'm sure she is. When we come

182
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,720
back, Elvis's weight loss journey, which

183
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,360
is an important one. How we went from

184
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,360
this to this, and he kept off every

185
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,880
pound, which is what's most incredible.

186
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,319
The secret to keeping Well, you look

187
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,080
good to me. The secret to keeping the

188
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,840
weight off. What's next? We're back with

189
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,400
Elder Duran discussing his new book,

190
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,039
Where Do I Begin? Stories he got before

191
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,319
I could get There it is. Guess me up,

192
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,160
Dr. Oz. I sort of remember, he says,

193
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,919
from a life lived out loud, which

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,680
described how we navigated 20 plus years

195
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,120
in radio. Sell us a book. Send me some

196
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
books. Send us a book. It is actually

197
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,520
superbly done book. And I'm going to get

198
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,680
some details on it. You were one of the

199
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,639
first to read it. Was I? It's weird if

200
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
you write a book and then someone says,

201
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,240
"I read your book." You're thinking, "Oh

202
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,680
Lord, here we go." What' you think? You

203
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
actually said you liked it. I love the

204
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,160
book. You know, in the break, you put

205
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
the flowers on that he was taking out of

206
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,479
my uh my my plant grouping here. You

207
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
thought they were fake, didn't you? I

208
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,080
did. I make those. But they're real. So,

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,240
are we going to make a shake out of

210
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,400
those or something? It's going to be

211
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,240
something similar to that. You shared a

212
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,599
lot with your audience uh about this

213
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,280
gastric sleeve surgery that you had.

214
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,120
Yes. It was a very brave move. There are

215
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,479
many people that we both you and I know

216
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,919
and all of you know who've had that

217
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,800
operation and haven't told anybody about

218
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,520
it. Why? Why would you not share this

219
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,520
miracle with people? I mean, it saved my

220
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,800
life without a doubt. Explain how that

221
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,880
happened. I I agree with you. I think it

222
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,080
did save your life. It's not easy. Some

223
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,639
of our listeners said, "Well, this is

224
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,599
the easy way out to lose weight." No,

225
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,840
it's Where's the camera? No, no, no,

226
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,479
it's not. You know, you just when you

227
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,960
first have this this done, you can't eat

228
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,319
solid food at all. How did your

229
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,080
relationship with food change? Because

230
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,280
as good as an operation as it is,

231
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,000
there's a good number of people who

232
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,520
fail. I still love food. And when I'm

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm sure someone can relate when when

234
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm a little nervous or I'm anxious.

235
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,560
Food, right? Anyone else? Am I the only

236
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,879
one there? Food. Everybody. All of us.

237
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,879
Yeah.

238
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,680
The difference is is now my stomach is

239
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,000
this small versus this small. And so I

240
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,280
just can't fit as much in. But three

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,839
years into it, three and a half years

242
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,760
into it now, the stomach is is it's

243
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,440
expanding. So my relationship with food

244
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,360
is now changing. I now need to be

245
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,800
careful, more careful about what I put

246
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
in there. So, I know that you're

247
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,599
thoughtful from the moment you get up to

248
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,959
when you go to bed at night, but you're

249
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,399
so busy in the morning, talking to tens

250
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,240
of millions of us, that you got the

251
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,600
shake habit going. Yes. Which is sort of

252
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,959
good when you have a gastric sleeve,

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,560
right? Well, the shakes are already

254
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,800
done. It's in a bottle. It's in the

255
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,680
refrigerator. You open it and it's gone.

256
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,640
You know, I've got something new for

257
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,640
you. Come over here. Oh, not one of

258
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,800
these shakes. Dr. Don't forget the book.

259
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,240
Come on. Oh my gosh. This is my my Berry

260
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,519
Elvis morning shake. Berry berry Elvis

261
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,399
morning shake. This is what I'm going to

262
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,760
have you do. This is this is what it

263
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,360
looks like when it's finished. I like

264
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,240
everything that's in the shake but not

265
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
in the same shake. Like you got salad,

266
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
you got fruit. What makes it special is

267
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,040
you get your fistfuls of leafy greens.

268
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,040
No one knows they're in there. The

269
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,880
berries overwhelming the taste. And I

270
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,880
think if it tastes good, this could be

271
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,920
what you do in the mornings to remember

272
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,440
me. You get up and think, I feel very

273
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,519
very Elvisy today. Okay. But if I don't

274
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,200
like it, I can be honest. Yeah. Be our

275
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,000
friends. Be honest. All right.

276
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,720
Oh, so good. That's awesome. You agree?

277
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,040
You agree? That's good. Okay. How much

278
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,240
weight have you lost? Uh, right around

279
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,240
120. A little over 120 lbs.

280
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,959
So, 120 lbs. Got me thinking. I have a

281
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,880
little surprise. I could calculate 120

282
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,000
lbs. Please. Why is he always leaving

283
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,560
me? Okay, I'll lead him along with me.

284
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,720
So 120 lbs is in the radio language 171

285
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,519
microphones, which is a lot of guests we

286
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,279
have on the show. It is 6,857

287
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,399
earbuds. Since you're listening to music

288
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,800
all the time, you know that's how much

289
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,320
they weigh. That's what they weigh. But

290
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,079
most importantly, cuz I'm so proud of

291
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,160
you, it's 122 copies of your new book.

292
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,920
All right.

293
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,600
because it you'll need at least that

294
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,040
many to feed everybody in this audience

295
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,519
and everyone out there because I'm so

296
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,959
proud of you at so many levels and I

297
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,640
applaud you for putting it in on paper

298
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,240
so we can all experience what you've

299
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,600
gone through, gain from your wisdom and

300
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,480
be better for it. God bless you. I love

301
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,640
you, Dr. Ross. I love you, my friend.

302
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,120
All right, so pick up the book. It's

303
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,640
fantastic. Where do I begin? Stories

304
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
that I sort of remember from a life

305
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,079
lived out loud. Thank you for watching.
