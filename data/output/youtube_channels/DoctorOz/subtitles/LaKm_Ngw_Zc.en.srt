00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,640
Dr. Oz reveals the one anti-aging

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,240
product you're not using. You're wasting

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,680
your time and you're wasting your money.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,519
>> Look younger overnight.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,200
>> It works immediately. That's the nice

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,519
thing about it.

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,519
>> Today, I've asked everyone to circle

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
their worst wrinkle, the area they wish

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,000
looked smoother and younger. I did it to

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,240
help us answer one big question. What's

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
the most important product you can use

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,560
to target that spot that you circled? Is

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,800
it a moisturizer? Is it a lotion? Is it

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,800
something else? Well, the powerful

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,320
anti-aging secret I want you all to use

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
is, are you ready?

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,079
>> Yes.

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,840
>> Alpha hydroxy acids. They're making a

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,760
big comeback and we're now learning that

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
they can fight the signs of aging deep

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,360
under your skin, deep inside of you.

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,640
Now, they're cheap. They're easy to use.

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,039
And by the end of today, you're going to

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
know what type of alpha hydroxy acid is

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,480
best for you. So, we find out why you

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,680
circled yourselves and where you went.

27
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,000
Narin, you want to join us first?

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,800
>> Sure.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,199
>> Then, if you don't mind.

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,640
>> Sure.

31
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,039
>> So, you circled under your eyes.

32
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,440
>> Yes.

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
>> Why there? Because as I age, I look in

34
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
the mirror and I want to cry. I want to

35
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,480
walk out with my sunglasses because when

36
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,559
I look at pictures when I was younger,

37
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,640
it looks smooth. And I used to get

38
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,479
carded up until I was 30. I swear I hit

39
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,520
35 and they're like, "Go ahead, get out

40
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,799
of here."

41
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
>> So, you want to get carded going

42
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,400
forward?

43
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,760
>> Yeah, that would be great.

44
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
>> Is that an aspiration many of you have?

45
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
Getting carded.

46
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,600
>> What do you do for your under eye

47
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,680
wrinkles?

48
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,280
>> I've tried every cream imaginable. So, I

49
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
do a nightly cream um and I don't know

50
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
if it works or not. I definitely feel a

51
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,159
difference when I don't use it, but I've

52
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,840
even done like for allergies, I think

53
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
it's from rubbing my eyes, so I've used

54
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
eye drops and you know,

55
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,159
>> you're going to like our suggestions

56
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,759
today. Thank you very much. I also have

57
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
Tara. Tara, how are you?

58
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,520
>> Hi, good. How are you?

59
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
>> Where did you circle?

60
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,320
>> I circled around my laugh lines.

61
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,119
>> Yeah, I should point. Some people circle

62
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,400
their whole face. It doesn't count.

63
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,880
Doesn't count at all. I'm glad you

64
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,520
specified there. And why there?

65
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,280
>> Well, put um when I look in the mirror

66
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,560
now, I see the dimples I always dreamed

67
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,759
of.

68
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,000
>> All right. And when you when you see

69
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,560
those wrinkles that make you feel

70
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,079
>> a little older,

71
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
>> you want to get carded also.

72
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,159
>> Yes, I do.

73
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,520
>> All right. Thank you for sharing those

74
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,680
those stories. So, I'm going to show you

75
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,280
how alpha hydroxy acids can help you

76
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
smooth out the fine lines that you all

77
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,360
hate the most. So, I'm going to bring in

78
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
dermatologist Dr. Janette Graph. Thanks

79
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,640
for joining us, Dr. Graph.

80
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,040
>> Thank you. It's great to be here.

81
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,480
>> So, you just got some good insights

82
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,239
about the wrinkles and how they bother

83
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,400
folks. Why is it that alpha hydroxy

84
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,239
acids are making such a big comeback?

85
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,400
>> Well, there's a lot of new research

86
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,200
about alpha hydroxy acids. They are

87
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,000
natural acids that are found in fruits,

88
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,319
in milk. And what they do is they take

89
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,160
this dead skin cell layer which collects

90
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,640
as we get older, making our lines and

91
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,200
wrinkles look deeper and it removes them

92
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,000
and renews the skin. And nothing works

93
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,760
as effectively as an alpha hydroxy acid.

94
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
>> Now, they are found these are, you know,

95
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,879
these are weak acids, right? They're

96
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,160
gentle ones. If they're found in foods

97
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,920
like sugar cane, they're found in milk.

98
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,239
They're found in fruits like apples and

99
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,519
lemons and oranges. And they're the

100
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,480
ingredients in a lot of different

101
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,840
products, right? They're in

102
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,560
moisturizers. They're in cleansers.

103
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,239
They're in masks. And because they're so

104
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
widely used, it makes sense. They

105
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,080
probably were used a long time ago as

106
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,239
well. In fact, Cleopatra's anti-aging

107
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,920
rituals a couple thousand years ago

108
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,760
included a milk bath, which was

109
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,519
basically to help exfoliate and to

110
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,920
smooth her skin. It was a type of alpha

111
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,879
hydroxy acid. So you're arguing, if I

112
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,159
understand correctly, there's not a

113
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,680
single woman in this audience who are

114
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,760
watching us right now on television who

115
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
should not be using alpha hydroxy acids.

116
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,959
>> Absolutely correct.

117
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,120
>> So does alpha hydroxy acid work better

118
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,599
in some age women than others?

119
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,120
>> Actually, alpha hydroxy acids work well

120
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,959
in all ages in all age groups, but if

121
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,720
you're older when you try it for the

122
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,200
first time and you have a greater

123
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,480
collection of dead skin, you will see a

124
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
bigger difference.

125
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,920
>> That might be good news for a lot of

126
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,560
folks.

127
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,280
>> That's right.

128
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
>> Right. All right. The other thing I

129
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,560
don't understand is is why do we stop

130
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,560
using it because it was there at the

131
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
very beginning. So Norin, if I can ask

132
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,440
you a question. Yes.

133
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,360
>> Have you ever tried alpha hydroxy acid?

134
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,519
>> Um I tried it a long time ago thinking I

135
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,920
could avoid this but it made my skin

136
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,040
very dry and a little bit red and I

137
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,200
didn't think I could use it under my

138
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,879
eyes to be honest. So

139
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,519
>> And did did you have a reaction to it?

140
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,360
>> Yeah, I felt like I got um red dry skin

141
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,560
from it. So then I stopped using it.

142
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,280
>> Oh. So you thought it was from the alpha

143
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,200
hydroxy?

144
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,280
>> I thought it was from that. So I don't

145
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
know. And Tara, have you ever used it?

146
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,120
>> No.

147
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
>> Never tried it.

148
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,479
>> That I know of.

149
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,840
>> That that you know of? I love that. Had

150
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,080
you ever heard of it before?

151
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,000
>> I've heard of it, but I hear of a lot of

152
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,440
things and I'm busy and when I have that

153
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
moment to write something down, I run to

154
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,160
the store to get it and I'm not sure if

155
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,400
that's in it.

156
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,639
>> Right.

157
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,560
>> So, Dr. Graph, I mean, since it was

158
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,840
there and probably, you know, certainly

159
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,199
at the beginning of our careers, why do

160
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600
you think it changed? Why did it drop

161
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,840
out of favor? Well, for exactly the

162
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,000
reason that we heard because initially

163
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,639
when they first came out, many of the

164
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,479
alpha hydroxy products were irritating.

165
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,080
So, there were a lot of complaints and

166
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,000
then they fell out of favor with a

167
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,080
number of people. Many people still use

168
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,040
them, but I have to say there's two

169
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,199
reasons. One is the formulations today

170
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,520
are completely different. So, they're

171
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,680
pretty safe to use and they've kind of

172
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,919
perfected them. So, all skin types can

173
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
use them. And depending on where you use

174
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,280
them, you can use them around the eye

175
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,440
area in eye creams. You can use them on

176
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,840
the face in serum form. You can use them

177
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,840
on the body on different areas. But the

178
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,400
other thing is there we're bombarded by

179
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
so many skin care products today that

180
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,400
it's hard for consumers to know what

181
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,240
they should be using. So it's great that

182
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,160
we're revisiting this topic because it

183
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,759
is so important. Oh, well, once I

184
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
understood the research on alpha hydroxy

185
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,880
acid, I felt really passionate about

186
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,720
getting this up because so many folks

187
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,479
ask questions around skincare and we've

188
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,759
got sometimes you think we have the

189
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
basics, but I think a lot of it is

190
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,880
marketing, right? Let me show you all

191
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,639
why I think it's the most important

192
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,720
thing for you to have in your skinincare

193
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,000
collection. So, here's an animation of

194
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
what your skin looks like. Many of you

195
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
have complained that you sort of have a

196
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,560
dullness to your face. The reason for

197
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,560
that is the old skin cells lie there and

198
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,880
they sort of hang out and they cause

199
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,800
these little valleys and and crevices

200
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,320
and that reflects the light weirdly. So

201
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,880
you look dull when you look in the

202
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,720
mirror. Now if you put on alpha hydroxy

203
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,479
acids, they coat the entire surface of

204
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,400
the skin, but they also go deep under

205
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,080
the skin. Does that make sense? When it

206
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,680
goes through the skin, it creates a new

207
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,160
environment for the cells lying under

208
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
there. Now that envir environment makes

209
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
these cells vulnerable and it makes

210
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,440
these cells more likely to die quickly.

211
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,000
That's a good thing because that means

212
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,960
that those older cells leave faster.

213
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,479
They allow new vibrant young uh cells to

214
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,479
come to the surface. They don't have

215
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,080
those nooks and crannies and valleys.

216
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,600
So, they don't reflect the light in

217
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,039
weird fashions. And because of that,

218
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,560
you'll have that more youthful looking

219
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,800
skin. And if I'm hearing correctly, you

220
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,400
may even see this benefit more in folks

221
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,960
who are a bit older. So, it's a smart

222
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,160
thing to revisit. So, Nar and Terra,

223
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,400
since you know, you've got huge

224
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,520
aspirations getting carded again. Uh

225
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
what I'm going to do when we come back

226
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,960
is talk about why alpha hydroxy acids

227
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,639
are the most valuable tool to help those

228
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,400
wrinkles. So, up next, the mistake

229
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,600
you're making every day that's aging

230
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,360
you. You're going to be surprised to

231
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,680
find out what you are doing wrong.

232
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,160
>> Dr. Oz Adah here for your wrinkle

233
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,400
report. About 5 years ago, I started

234
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,039
noticing the deep wrinkles under my

235
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,520
eyes. They just keep coming. I think

236
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,080
it's stress and lack of sleep. Whatever

237
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
it is, Dr. Oz, is there a way we can

238
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,599
slow the process on this? Can you help

239
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
me, please?

240
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,440
>> We're talking about your aging skin.

241
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,240
Let's bring in Julie, who says her daily

242
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,560
anti-aging skincare routine is a very

243
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,400
involved process. So, you took some

244
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,479
video of your typical nighttime routine.

245
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,919
>> I did. As you all watch it, how many

246
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,319
steps do you go through? Describe this

247
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,160
for us.

248
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,960
>> Uh, there's about seven, eight,

249
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,960
sometimes nine. It could go on forever.

250
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
>> Nine steps.

251
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,759
>> Why so many things?

252
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
>> Uh, you know, I'm trying to get rid of

253
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,440
these wrinkles. I have a young young

254
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,800
daughter, so I just I feel like I've got

255
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,319
to do something with these things.

256
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,199
>> It is dizzying.

257
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,039
>> It really is.

258
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,000
>> So, how long you been doing this for?

259
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,919
You know what? Over 20s something years.

260
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,440
>> 20 years. Nine steps a night.

261
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,280
>> Yes.

262
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,759
>> And anyone can bow for me if they look

263
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,960
in my my bathroom cabinet. I have every

264
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,960
product out there you can imagine.

265
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,400
>> Keep in your life must be your

266
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,800
>> They don't know what I do themselves.

267
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,240
Exactly.

268
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,160
>> They have no idea what I do.

269
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,919
>> When when you are trying to buy an

270
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,720
anti-aging beauty product, what do you

271
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,639
look for?

272
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,680
>> You know, I look for anything that says

273
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,400
uh anti-rinkle smoothing cream. Anything

274
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,800
that has to do with wrinkles, I buy it.

275
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,919
So,

276
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,039
>> Dr. Graph, seems like she's got

277
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,759
everything covered. Is she missing

278
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,080
anything?

279
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,400
>> Well, I think that we could actually

280
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,960
save you some time because we could

281
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,840
probably cut out three of those steps

282
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,159
and just by adding an alpha hydroxy

283
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,039
acid, we could take care of several of

284
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,599
those steps.

285
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
>> Okay.

286
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,080
>> Do you exfoliate, Julie?

287
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,519
>> I do. I use a little brush. I use

288
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
scrubs. I use microbubbles. I use

289
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,760
everything.

290
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
>> So, a lot of different ways of

291
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,560
exfoliating.

292
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,240
>> Yes. This is a part of the story that I

293
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,080
only learned recently. I'm fascinated by

294
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,839
alpha hydroxy acid. How would you

295
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,880
compare that to other exfoliants that

296
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,760
that Julie's using?

297
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,240
>> I would say that alpha hydroxy acids are

298
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,800
smart. So when you put them on your

299
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,120
skin, there's a reaction that happens

300
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,320
because of how they interact with your

301
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,640
skin. Whereas a physical abrasive or

302
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,360
something that's mechanical, you

303
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,680
control. So, it can sometimes be to the

304
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,000
point of too much of a good thing or not

305
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,440
enough. So, that's where I like alpha

306
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,680
hydroxy acids.

307
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,000
>> Now, you hear so much though about

308
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,920
different acids. I mean, glycolic acid,

309
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
um, salicylic acid. What I mean, are

310
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,360
they all the same thing?

311
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,519
>> No, they're different. Salicylic acid is

312
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,040
a different type of acid, but glycolic

313
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,760
acid is one type of alpha hydroxy acid,

314
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
as is lactic acid, citric acid.

315
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm going to cover that in a moment, but

316
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,560
I want to show you first why it's so

317
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,399
important to use products that can strip

318
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,160
away that dead level of skin because

319
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,360
otherwise you're wasting your money. A

320
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,720
lot of those chemicals you're putting on

321
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,800
your face aren't actually getting to the

322
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
skin where they need to be in order to

323
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
help you, you know, achieve that young,

324
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,000
youthful skin that you desire. So, come

325
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,959
on over here. So, I I built you a little

326
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
flower garden.

327
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,240
>> Thank you.

328
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
>> You like flowers?

329
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,600
>> I love flowers.

330
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,920
>> All right. So, this is actually a

331
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,839
metaphor for your skin. And these

332
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,080
youthful, beautiful flowers down below

333
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,760
here are the young skin cells that need

334
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,560
to fuel the nutrients that you give

335
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,800
them. When you try to put creams,

336
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,800
serums, chemicals on your face to allow

337
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,720
you to age more gracefully, you need the

338
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,800
chemicals, the plant food, so to speak,

339
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,600
to get to the plants. But on our face,

340
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,959
we naturally have old dead skin cells.

341
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,480
And there's a covering with those dead

342
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,880
skin cells that makes it really hard for

343
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,000
the plant food to get to where it needs

344
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,480
to go. You see, those plants aren't

345
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,760
getting any of this at all. Nothing's

346
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,320
happening. Nothing's going through

347
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,839
whatsoever. You're starving your skin

348
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,120
cells that need the nutrients and you're

349
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,880
wasting your time and you're wasting

350
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,480
your money. This is true for all of you

351
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,920
who've circled parts of your face.

352
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,440
That's why the first thing you need to

353
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,120
do when you're going to put something

354
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,519
that might be beneficial on you is to

355
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,800
get rid of these other skin cells, the

356
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,079
old stuff you don't want there. So,

357
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,560
alpha hydroxy acid wipes all this away.

358
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,160
And by doing that, you now have an

359
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,920
environment where you can take

360
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,440
nutrients, whatever those serums and

361
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,920
creams and, you know, potions you're

362
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,079
using, and you can get that material to

363
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,560
these young skin cells that desperately

364
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,680
need it. So now you can water

365
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,360
the the skin just where it needs to be.

366
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Right? That's why exfoliation is so

367
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,680
important. So Dr. Graph, how much more

368
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,079
valuable would Julie's anti-aging

369
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,839
solutions be if she was able to do this?

370
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,720
Well, just from your excellent

371
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,480
demonstration, you can see dramatically

372
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,320
different. It will be dramatically

373
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,720
improved because it's like removing a

374
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,880
barrier to your house. It's opening a

375
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,399
door so you can enter. Think of all the

376
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,279
ingredients that are just sitting on

377
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,600
your skin, not getting in because that

378
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,600
layer of dead skin is blocking.

379
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
>> Now, the key question here is if you

380
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,640
want to get these flowers nutrients that

381
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,959
they want, you have to be able to find

382
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,440
the right kind of alpha hydroxy acid,

383
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,519
don't you?

384
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,279
>> Yes, absolutely. That, my friends, is a

385
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,360
pretty critical decision. So, coming up

386
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,959
next, the best anti-aging match for

387
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,680
every skin type. Find out what's right

388
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,480
for you.

389
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,640
>> Hi, Dr. Oz. It's Deborah here with my

390
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,800
wrinkle report. I have these annoying

391
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,680
wrinkles under my eyes that started in

392
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,480
my 40s. I've tried creams. I've tried

393
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,279
concealers. Nothing works. I guess it's

394
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,839
just a normal aging process. Or maybe

395
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm dehydrated. What can I do about

396
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,160
this, Dr. Oz?

397
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,959
So, what's the best type of alpha

398
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,800
hydroxy acid for dry, for oily, or for

399
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,959
combination skin? Let's bring in sisters

400
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,480
Sharon and Alicia. Now, Sharon says her

401
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,360
skin is very dry. Is that correct?

402
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,880
>> It is very dry.

403
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,440
>> And have you ever used alpha hydroxy

404
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
acid before?

405
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,959
>> I used alpha hydroxy probably 15 years

406
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,959
ago, but as soon as I put it on my face,

407
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,680
it just burned

408
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,079
>> and I had to wipe it off immediately.

409
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,839
>> So, Dr. Graph, common complaint. Should

410
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,639
Sharon give it the alpha hydroxy acid

411
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,440
another shot? Definitely. Also, 15 years

412
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,680
ago, they were more irritating. But for

413
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,720
someone like you, Sharon, whose skin is

414
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,800
dry or for darker skin tone patients or

415
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,360
patients with sensitive skin conditions

416
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,680
like rosacea, I recommend the

417
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,760
polyhydroxy acids. Now, I'm going to put

418
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,760
some on your hand. This is in a serum

419
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,760
form. You can get them in serums. You

420
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,680
can get them in cleansers. You can get

421
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,880
them as moisturizers. And you dab this

422
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,880
around your face and just blend it in.

423
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,120
and all my wrinkle spots.

424
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,519
>> I I would put it everywhere because what

425
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,920
it's also what it does is it helps to

426
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,839
even out your skin tone, too. So, just

427
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,800
think what's in that dead skin cell

428
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,720
layer. Age spots, wrinkles, everything

429
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,360
looks accentuated. So, when you

430
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,760
exfoliate that top layer, the skin looks

431
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,200
brighter and more even toned and you can

432
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
just blend it in.

433
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,519
>> Yeah, it feels very smooth.

434
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,519
>> So, it's a new generation of an

435
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,279
anti-aging serum. And And how often

436
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,920
should Sharon be using it? Sharon could

437
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,839
use this every night and at this is a

438
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,320
serum. So you could put your moisturizer

439
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,639
on right over it or if this is fine, you

440
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,240
can just leave it and sleep like this.

441
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,360
>> So is this sufficient just to use this

442
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,200
by itself?

443
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
>> If it's moisturizing enough for you if

444
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,720
you have dry skin, you may want to put a

445
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,120
moisturizer over it, but I also like it

446
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,040
on the neck, on the chest. These are a

447
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,639
areas that have aging skin. You can put

448
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,000
it on the back of your hands,

449
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,000
>> but in theory, you could just use the

450
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,079
alpha hydroxy acid. Use nothing else

451
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,600
besides that. If if your skin doesn't

452
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,600
feel dry, then you're good to go.

453
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
>> You're good to go. Most of the time, if

454
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,000
you're using a serum, you may want to

455
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,000
put a moisturizer over it because the

456
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,079
serums are very concentrated, so they

457
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
may be a little bit tight or they may

458
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,800
make your skin feel a little tight. So,

459
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
you may want to put a moisturizer over

460
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,160
it.

461
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,440
>> How's it feel, Sharon?

462
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,959
>> It feels smooth.

463
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,079
>> She got a dab in her nose. You should

464
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,120
clean that off. Otherwise, people

465
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,120
complain about it. It's

466
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,519
>> got to smooth it out a little bit. Okay.

467
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,519
>> I love sisters.

468
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,120
>> Let's take a look.

469
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,920
Yeah. Very good. You did a good job.

470
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,040
>> Does it burn?

471
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,560
>> Not a bit. Not a bit.

472
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,079
>> No, I could keep it on now. Okay.

473
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,519
>> I'm not I'm not like grabbing the raw

474
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,800
shagg and trying to get it off as

475
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,320
quickly as possible.

476
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,680
>> So, your sister Lysa has a very

477
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,480
different kind of skin. You argue your

478
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,199
skin is is oily.

479
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,800
>> My skin is very oily. Yes. It's um shiny

480
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
all the time. Shiny. And I'm usually

481
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,079
always blotting or, you know, trying to

482
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,600
put more powder on to cover up the

483
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,639
shine. It just it's just a mess. It's

484
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
>> like an oil slick.

485
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,399
>> Oh, huge oil slick. You know, it's like,

486
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,320
you know, bright shiny light when I walk

487
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,519
out in the sun. Ah. Dr. Graph, what do

488
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,639
you recommend for oily skin? So, we

489
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,120
already covered dry skin.

490
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,519
>> For oily skin, I recommend glycolic

491
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,920
acid. Glycolic acid is the strongest of

492
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,720
the alpha hydroxy acids. It penetrates

493
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,519
quickly. So, if you have oily or acne

494
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,320
prone skin, glycolic acid is great to

495
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,320
use. You can use it in a light lotion or

496
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,160
in a cream. And you would put it on much

497
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,959
the same way as Yeah. Just a little bit

498
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,480
on your face. Just rubbing a small

499
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,320
amount. You could also

500
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,880
>> you you spot it, distribute it, and put

501
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,320
it everywhere. I would also recommend

502
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,880
that you could use a cleanser that

503
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,000
contains glycolic acid also.

504
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,000
>> No. How about that spot there?

505
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,279
>> She's trying to help you.

506
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,480
>> Thanks, sis.

507
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,199
>> I know. I'm just making you beautiful,

508
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
you know. Oh,

509
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,120
>> it's priceless. Never changes. Now,

510
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,199
while they're while they're bickering

511
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,639
over here, what about the in between

512
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,160
skin types? So, if you're not dry,

513
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,320
you're not oily, what do you recommend?

514
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,320
>> Combination, normal skin types, I like

515
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,959
lactic acid, which as we know comes from

516
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,160
sour milk. Lactic acid is great because

517
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,320
it moisturizes. It It exfoliates. It

518
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,920
exfoliates. It's found pretty widely,

519
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,320
and you can use it. You find it in a lot

520
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,480
of body moisturizers also because it's

521
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,839
great for the body. So, it's a really

522
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,959
good moisturizer for oily and

523
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,240
combination skin.

524
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,000
>> And just to make it clear for everybody,

525
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,600
what is the most effective way to use

526
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,199
alpha hydroxy acid? Once you find the

527
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,720
right kind for your skin type, what's

528
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,880
what's the formula for that?

529
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,759
>> The best the most effective form is

530
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,839
either a serum, a lotion, or a cream

531
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,360
because they are leave-on products. So,

532
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,160
when you put them on your skin, the

533
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,320
alpha hydroxy is able to stay there. If

534
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,639
you use, you can add a cleanser for

535
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,920
added benefits, but if you use just a

536
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,519
cleanser, you're rinsing it off, so

537
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,240
you're not going to get as lasting

538
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
benefits.

539
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,199
>> And what about sun exposure? Because I

540
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,160
know once you've taken that superficial

541
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,360
layer of skin off, you've taken

542
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,600
protection off as well.

543
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,839
>> That's right. The alpha hydroxy acids

544
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,000
will make the skin more sensitive to the

545
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,280
sun. So, absolutely every single day of

546
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
the year, you should use a

547
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,760
broadspectctrum sunblock, UVA and UVB

548
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,959
with an SPF of 30.

549
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,120
>> Otherwise, you're wasting all the

550
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,240
benefit of what we're trying to do here.

551
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,280
>> Thank you very much. You guys can keep

552
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,160
equivalent over here if you want.

553
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,679
>> Oh, yeah. I'll win that battle.

554
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,439
>> Thank you for watching. Don't forget to

555
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,919
subscribe and turn on notifications so

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,400
