2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Today I am weighing in on dairy. Now

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,960
we've known for some time that fat has a

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,880
place in our diet and that's raised a

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,480
lot of questions including which is

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,759
healthier, whole fat or low fat. Now a

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,359
new study making headlines around the

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,240
world not only questions the type of

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,520
milk you serve your family but also it's

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,640
maybe finally setting the record

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,640
straight on dairy in general.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,640
Three servings a day. The government

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,079
says that's how much low or fat-free

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,840
dairy you should consume every day. It's

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,120
been the official recommendation since

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,000
1985 when the USDA made the switch to

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,079
low-fat dairy as a means of managing fat

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
intake.

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,480
Since then, fat-ree dairy has been

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,360
filling and flying off supermarket

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,239
shelves. There's low and no fat versions

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,879
of milk, cheese, ice cream, even

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,920
fat-free half and half. The fat-ree

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,160
trend first took root in the 1970s when

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,040
a controversial government commission

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,080
touted a low-fat diet as the best way to

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,880
tackle heart disease and shed pounds.

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,680
Now, two new landmark studies suggest

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,159
people consuming full fat dairy actually

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,640
weigh less than their low and no fat

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,159
counterparts and have lower risk for

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
diabetes.

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,560
But with controversy still surrounding

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,200
saturated fat, the kind found in full

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,080
fat dairy. What percentage should you be

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,159
pouring?

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,000
Joining us is a world expert in this

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,759
field, Dr. David Cass, great medical

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,159
expert at Yale and founder of the True

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,880
Health Initiative. He's published Kelly

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,040
more than 200 research papers, 15 books

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,640
on nutrition, lifestyle, and health. So

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,960
I went to you the expert on this. Why

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,040
has this study had such an impact on our

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,439
field? Well, the impact, I think, is all

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,960
these headlines. And since people eat

47
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,399
every day, they're fascinated with every

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,399
study about diet. And the ones that make

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,079
the headlines aren't the best studies or

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,520
the most important ones. They're the

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,880
most shocking ones, the most surprising

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,320
ones, and in particular, the ones that

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,119
tell us what we want to hear. Like ice

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,200
cream is good for us today. Fat is good.

55
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,959
So, I think that's the impact is really

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
all about those issues. Let's talk about

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,840
what the studies actually showed. And

58
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,640
and there's two we're going to highlight

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,319
that. first looked at

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,000
a lot of folks and the effect of the

61
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,319
effect of dairy and on their weight and

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,920
diabetes. So go ahead. Right. Yeah. So,

63
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:27,360
so this study looked at an association

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,360
between fats from dairy in the blood and

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,480
the likelihood of developing diabetes

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,720
over time and is shown here 46% lesser

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,920
likelihood of developing diabetes in

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,239
over 3,000 people when there was dairy

69
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,000
fat in their blood. Now, importantly,

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,519
that's just a study of association.

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,879
There there were other things that might

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,400
have accounted for the lower rate of

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,920
diabetes. We'll come back to that. But

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,200
that's basically what this study showed.

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
But in theory, if you look at this, you

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,879
say, "Okay, if I if I have fats from

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,560
yogurt or milk in my blood, seems to I

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,640
that seems that I have a much lower risk

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,280
of getting diabetes on the surface." And

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,720
and if that were a strong consistent

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
finding and if it were consistent with

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
other research, I think we could be more

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
confident about it. But actually the

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,400
association with specific dairy fats was

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
pretty weak. It wasn't totally

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
consistent. In other words, there were

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,720
associations between certain fats from

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,840
dairy but not all fats from dairy. So I

89
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,280
don't think we have a definitive answer

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
there. Okay. And the other big study

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,920
looked at something people are always

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,080
asking me about which is will I lose

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,239
weight or gain weight if I eat whole fat

94
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,400
dairy. Yeah. And I think that's a really

95
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,480
important question because if there is a

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
defense against diabetes men as you know

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,799
the main driver of the risk for type two

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,680
diabetes is weight gain. So this study

99
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,760
actually a larger group of of women

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
there was an association between eating

101
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,599
full fat dairy and protection against

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
weight gain over time. Now does that

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,920
make sense? Well yeah it could for a

104
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,000
couple of reasons. First if the fat and

105
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,640
dairy fills us up and keeps us full

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,640
satiety. If we get satiety from the fat

107
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,959
and dairy then we might actually eat

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,879
less calories overall and that of course

109
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,120
protects against weight gain. The other

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,959
thing is that fat does not raise blood

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,280
sugar directly and it doesn't trigger an

112
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,959
insulin release and it's the rise in

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,879
blood sugar and the release of insulin

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,120
that causes fat to accumulate around the

115
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,200
middle and that's the fat that increases

116
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,720
the risk for diabetes in particular. So

117
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,720
there may be protection because of

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,320
satiety that that lasting feeling

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,400
feeling of fullness and there may be

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,720
some protection because you're pushing

121
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,280
out of your diet sugar and refined

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,040
starch calories that do have an effect

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,479
on blood sugar and insulin levels. Come

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,240
on over. Let's draw some some pictures

125
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,720
here for everybody. Maybe this might

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,320
help you understand how Dr. Katz is is

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,960
interpreting what we're seeing. So,

128
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,479
let's say you have skim milk. All right?

129
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,880
You put skim milk in your stomach and it

130
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,880
has about 90 calories a cup, right? So,

131
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,440
you actually don't feel like you're

132
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,360
completely full, but you had your milk,

133
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
but you don't quite feel like you got it

134
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,360
all in there, right? If you have whole

135
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
milk, well, it's got fat in it, and for

136
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,280
that reason, actually has extra

137
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,199
calories, 150 calories specifically.

138
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,120
Let's compare these. You got the whole

139
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
milk, 150 calories. That's more than the

140
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,040
90 calories from the skim milk. So in

141
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,199
theory, in theory, you should gain

142
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,320
weight with whole milk and lose weight

143
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,800
with skim milk. Don't you all think

144
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,800
that? Right? Makes perfect sense. Right?

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,639
What Dr. Catz is saying is this

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
difference of this, you know, 60 calorie

147
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,880
difference. You make up over the course

148
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,759
of the day because you get the

149
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,440
grumbling, the growl, the hunger. That

150
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
that looks like a lot of us, right?

151
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,320
You're still hungry after you have that

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,639
skim milk. And the things you go after

153
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,160
oftentimes will have sugar in them. Some

154
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,919
in America we eat a lot of sugar. So

155
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,600
that might penalize you either because

156
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,919
of the hormones or because the fat

157
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,759
directly has a benefit. Who knows why?

158
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,280
But that's been the big slippery slope

159
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
here because on the surface you'll see

160
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
why everyone in America thought skim

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
milk was better. Now some researchers

162
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,560
are saying that this type of fat you

163
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,800
touched on was vitally important. It

164
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,639
might be the reason for this. Yeah. So

165
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,600
so a couple issues here. So, you know,

166
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,320
given a choice between 90 calories from

167
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,479
skim milk plus a whole bunch of calories

168
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,479
from cookies cuz you're still hungry

169
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,400
versus the 150 from whole milk, you may

170
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,600
be better off with the whole milk. I

171
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,960
think this all comes down to association

172
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,720
and context. So, these are studies of

173
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,880
association. They don't prove cause and

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
effect. You know, maybe the people who

175
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,840
ate the full fat dairy were people who

176
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
were less concerned about their weight

177
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,479
in the first place. Maybe they didn't

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,400
gain weight because they weren't as

179
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,600
prone to gain weight and they said, "I

180
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,440
can afford the calories." only the

181
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,199
dieters drank the skim milk. We we just

182
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
don't know for sure. Um there are a lot

183
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,919
of other things that might have

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,919
accounted for the association both with

185
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,840
weight and with diabetes. There are some

186
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,680
fats in dairy that might be specifically

187
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,560
protective. And by the way, not all the

188
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,520
fat in dairy is saturated. Some of it is

189
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,080
conjugated lolinic acids and these are

190
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,919
thought to bump up metabolic rate just a

191
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,600
little bit but maybe enough to make a

192
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,000
difference over a span of years. So

193
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,039
there may be some healthy fats in dairy.

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,280
To me, context is key. Now you your your

195
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,880
heritage is Mediterranean. There are a

196
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,039
lot of healthy fats in the Mediterranean

197
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,680
diet. You get them from nuts and seeds,

198
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,639
olive, avocado, fish, seafood. I would

199
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,440
argue if you're getting satiety from

200
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,120
healthy, wholesome foods, fiber in in

201
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,039
vegetables and fruits and whole grains,

202
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,520
beans and lentils, healthy fats from

203
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,319
those sources, there's very like

204
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,479
unlikely to be much benefit from the the

205
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
fat in dairy. And and the healthiest

206
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,520
diets around the world, healthiest

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,960
populations, they don't eat much dairy.

208
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,960
the blue zones, they don't eat much

209
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,680
dairy and the dairy they eat is goat and

210
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,120
sheep, not cow. And and most of the

211
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,800
intervention studies that have produced

212
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,199
the best results, even preventing

213
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,680
diabetes, haven't relied very much on

214
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,599
dairy. So, what does David Katz do in

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,120
his family? What do you actually do

216
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,479
differently based on this research? So,

217
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,840
I I haven't changed anything based on

218
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
these studies because I think they're

219
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,039
interesting, but I don't think they

220
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,319
provide a definitive answer. So, the

221
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,440
average person trying to make a decision

222
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,840
right now, the mom's going to go to the

223
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,479
store today and buy a carton of milk.

224
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,759
Does it matter really whether it's skim

225
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,599
1% 2% or full fat three and a half%. You

226
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,120
know, I I think it matters in context.

227
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,599
If you're eating a typical American

228
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,360
diet, you might derive some benefit from

229
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,039
the higher fat varieties. And if you

230
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
wanted to split the difference, 2% is

231
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,599
right in the middle. It's had 50 what I

232
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,759
do. It's had 50% of the fat taken out.

233
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,160
It hasn't had 98% of the fat t is right

234
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,759
in the middle. Um so again, if you have

235
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,960
trouble controlling your appetite, your

236
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,879
hunger, and you're eating a typical

237
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,560
American diet, first of all, fix that.

238
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,160
But, you know, dairy fat may be your

239
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,759
friend. If you don't have trouble

240
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,919
staying full, if you're getting plenty

241
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,000
of healthy fat from nuts, seeds, olives,

242
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,599
avocado, fish, I don't think there's a

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,840
specific reason based on these studies

244
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,759
to add dairy fat to your diet. I'm going

245
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,399
shopping for 2%. David Catz, thank you

246
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,680
very much. My bottom line on dairy

247
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,959
approved options for both you and your

248
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,640
family. When we come back,

249
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,200
we've been talking about a new study on

250
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,279
dairy suggesting that whole fat is a

251
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,360
healthier choice over low fat to ward

252
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,320
off diabetes and weight gain. So, in

253
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,000
light of the study and all the

254
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
controversy around it, what are the best

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
dairy product recommendations for you

256
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,800
and your family? What are you going to

257
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
buy? Pediatrician Dr. Tanya Alman has

258
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,240
the answers because she's given them

259
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,760
every day in her office. So, first off,

260
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
there's been a lot of controversy about

261
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,880
whether adults should have any dairy at

262
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
all. So, what do you tell your patients

263
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,399
and their parents? So, I talk to the

264
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,920
parents as much about nutrition as I do

265
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,680
the kids. And dairy products are

266
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,600
important for all ages. They provide

267
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,200
protein, calcium, vitamin D. These are

268
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,120
nutrients that most people don't get

269
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
enough of. So, the recommendations are

270
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,120
still three servings a day of dairy

271
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,399
products for adults. Cup of milk, 3/4

272
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,720
cup of yogurt. I know you love Greek

273
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
yogurt like I do or a slice of cheese.

274
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,160
All right, let's talk about the milk

275
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
specifically. There's two rules that you

276
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,640
argue everyone should abide by when

277
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,040
they're buying milk for their family. So

278
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
organic milk is from cows raised

279
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,800
organically which means that their feed

280
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,720
doesn't contain chemical pesticides or

281
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,240
fertilizers. They're not given hormones

282
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
and they're not given antibiotics. So

283
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,120
that's less exposure to all of those

284
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
things for your family. All right. And

285
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
why do I have these cool little goggles

286
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,959
here? What's try it? These are fun. My

287
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,360
patients love these. It's a great way to

288
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,480
make drinking milk fun for kids.

289
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,519
Do I have it? Right. I'll let you try

290
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,880
it. Oh my goodness. This is ridiculous.

291
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,000
In your mouth. There's got to be an

292
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,000
easier way to drink milk than this.

293
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,560
Wouldn't all kids love drinking milk

294
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,920
through fun straws? They would. Uh, they

295
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,920
would. I I got to say I'd rather use

296
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,279
these with curly cue things though. This

297
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,880
is it's a fashion statement. What about

298
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,640
raw milk? What do you think about folks

299
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,000
who love that? So, you know, raw milk

300
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,000
has become trendy because some people

301
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,760
perceive it as being less processed, but

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,519
the process of pasteurization, the

303
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,200
heating milk to kill bacteria is

304
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,560
actually important, especially when you

305
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
have kids and pregnant women drinking

306
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,440
the milk because you want to make sure

307
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,640
there's no dangerous bacteria. Then

308
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,320
there's the other end of the spectrum,

309
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
these ultra pasteurized milks, they

310
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,600
never seem to go bad, right?

311
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,959
Ultraasteurized milk can last in the

312
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,800
refrigerator for a lot longer. And in my

313
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,720
house, I buy three types of milk. I

314
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,360
drink non-fat, same as my 10-year-old.

315
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,360
My 8-year-old likes 1% or 2% and my

316
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,440
one-year-old drinks whole milk. So, in

317
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,560
some ways, ultra pasteurization can help

318
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,160
keep the milk longer in the

319
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,839
refrigerator, but it does taste a little

320
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,519
different, and some people don't love

321
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,200
the fact that it's more pasteurized.

322
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,480
Yeah, it seems seems more natural that

323
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,680
it would go bad, but I get if you're

324
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,959
buying lots of different kinds for

325
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,320
different age groups, you got to be

326
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,760
careful. Okay, speaking of that, let's

327
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,440
talk about the fact that one size

328
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,959
doesn't fit all when it comes to kids.

329
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,480
So, explain to us and we'll start off

330
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,600
with kids that are under a year of age,

331
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,519
what do you tell your patients about

332
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,680
what makes sense for them? So, under one

333
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,600
year of age, kids cannot drink regular

334
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,880
cow's milk because they can't really

335
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,240
absorb it. It doesn't have all the

336
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,640
important nutrients they need at that

337
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,760
age specifically. So, you want to make

338
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,279
sure you're giving your baby breast

339
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,880
milk. Obviously, is the best thing from

340
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,440
birth. This is breast milk until one and

341
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,120
only one heck of a breast.

342
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,399
This mom did a great job here. And if

343
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
you're not giving breast milk, then you

344
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,480
want to use an approved infant formula.

345
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,320
All right. But you can give yogurt, and

346
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,640
I love Greek yogurt even for babies

347
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
starting at 6 months of age. Plain. You

348
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,160
don't want to get them used to the sweet

349
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,480
taste of anything with added sugar. And

350
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,680
also cheese is also acceptable in a form

351
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,040
that they can handle. All right. What

352
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,440
about ages 1 to two? So age 1 to two,

353
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,880
the brain is really 60% fat. So they do

354
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,200
need the fat for brain development at

355
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,959
that age. So over age one, whole milk is

356
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,640
recommended. Now if you have a family

357
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,480
history of high cholesterol, heart

358
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,079
disease, then your pediatrician may

359
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
recommend 2% milk, which still has

360
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,360
enough fat for brain development. And

361
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,279
all this also counts, right? Exactly. If

362
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,639
you got a mom this giving, by the way,

363
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,800
you know, you can breastfeed to an

364
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,160
adult. Ex. It would be nutritious for us

365
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,480
as well. You want to try it with the

366
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
straw? No, I'm not going to try it. I

367
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,680
stopped breastfeeding a long time ago.

368
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,120
All right, now let's talk about people

369
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,160
like us. Anyone over the age of two,

370
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,160
frankly, what do you recommend? Over age

371
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,160
two, you can come down on the fat in the

372
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,399
milk if you like the taste and instead

373
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,200
give your family healthy plant-based

374
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
fats. Avocado, nuts, nut butter. We're

375
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,079
even giving nut butter now at six months

376
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,639
of age to babies to help prevent

377
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,279
allergies. And salmon is great for all

378
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,480
ages. Omega-3s, really healthy fat. So,

379
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,399
you give young children fish fats. I do.

380
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,240
I recommend everything at six months of

381
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,839
age. gets them used to eating healthy.

382
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,279
Start young and their taste buds will

383
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,279
like healthy food as they get older.

384
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,959
Thanks for the wonderful advice. Alman's

385
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,720
