1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,640
Lorraine Bronco. She's had an amazing

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,799
career from modeling, which I didn't

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,120
know she did, to her breakout role in

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,840
Good Fellas, I love that movie, and her

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,679
starring role in The Sopranos. But all

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,360
of her success didn't mean Lorraine was

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,600
happy. She found herself depressed,

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,600
overweight, and unhealthy. But now she's

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,000
fighting back, in great shape, and

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,080
feeling good. How did she do it? We're

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,790
about to find out. Line Braco, come on

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:33,769
out.

13
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:33,769
[Applause]

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,220
[Music]

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,120
[Applause]

16
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,920
[Music]

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,960
lots of love. Lots of very very well.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,680
You look wonderful. Very well. Really?

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,360
Come have a seat. Thank you. I feel

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,600
good. Yeah. You look happy, too. How

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,600
much weight have you lost? May I ask? 35

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,160
lbs. 35 lbs.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,680
It's pretty cool. 35 pounds, but I did

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,439
it slow and steady in about over a year.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,119
Well, you talk about it a lot. This is

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,880
Lorraine's new book. It's called To the

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
Fullest. It's about your journey towards

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,320
health. I am intrigued by the title to

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
the Fullest. Because you, if you don't

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,000
mind, I'd love if you could explain why

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,000
you called it that. Because I'm 60.

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,159
It's time to fill

33
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,960
up. And the truth of the matter is is

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,720
I'm in the third quarter of my life and

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,680
I want to live every day as strong and

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,159
hard and fun as I can make it. And

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,040
you're doing it. I am. Let me go back a

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
little bit because there have been times

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,320
where it was more difficult. And we

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,759
always celebrate success, but we also

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,240
want to figure out how you got here.

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,880
Your co-star in the Sopranos, James

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,799
Gandalfini. Yep. When you lost him, uh

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,439
it was painful for everybody. How did

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
that affect this this journey you're on?

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,439
Well, the truth of the matter is is, you

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,759
know, Jimmy was always a big guy. He's

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,000
was 6'4. He's a he's a big man. And um I

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,040
I remember this so well. We were on the

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,800
red carpet for something at HBO and I

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,200
hadn't seen him in a while. And I

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,440
grabbed his belly and I was like, "You

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,520
need to get rid of this." And he was

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,160
like, "Ah, it's all muscle. It's all

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,959
muscle muscle." And I'm like, "No, you

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,120
really have to pay attention." And you

57
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,959
know, we we laughed about it and he

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,200
says, "I'm working on it. I'm working on

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:32,800
it. I got a home gym now." And and

60
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,800
whatever. But the you know, he was the

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,519
thing that killed me about Jimmy is

62
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,080
besides loving him and and thinking that

63
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,360
he was the greatest sparring partner I

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,680
ever had, um he was a decade younger

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,840
than me. Yeah. A decade younger. And I

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,640
was like, "Wow, if that can, you know,

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,200
if if you can pass like that in in a

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,599
minute, well, then it can happen to to

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,519
me. It can happen to anybody." And a lot

70
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,120
of times it's the sadness in our lives

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,120
that lead us to do things like

72
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,319
medicating with food. You've had sad

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,159
times in your life. In fact, you

74
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,440
describe some of the circumstances in

75
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,800
the book. Could you help everyone

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,239
understand what was going on as you

77
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,159
gained weight, as you were doing the

78
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,040
things that were unhealthy for you?

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,599
Well, you know, my parents started to

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,239
fail and they were both 84. They are and

81
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,120
they were never healthy and they never

82
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,280
did anything that they should have done

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,080
uh o over the years. And I swore on my

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,239
life when we buried them that I was

85
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,879
going to do everything to get my health

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,920
back and I'm going to go down fighting.

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,599
Yeah. Come back for a second. I'm going

88
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,000
to take you a little journey.

89
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,360
Uh, this is a picture of you, a very

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,879
different version of Lorraine. When you

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,879
see this, Lorraine, you see this? Yeah.

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,400
What's going on? Describe that person to

93
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
me.

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,360
Well, unaware.

95
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,200
Unaware. Unaware of her health and her

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,519
weight. So, how did this woman become

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,519
this woman?

98
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,439
I I wanted to live the third part of my

99
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,239
life in in a in a big way. Not in a

100
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,000
little way. Not in a sick way, not in a

101
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,919
in a way where where I didn't have any

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
energy. I'm I'm a grandmother. Oh, I

103
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:29,120
love that. I love that.

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,320
And I know you are also. And I'm a

105
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,960
grandfather. I Well, yes. Yes. I've

106
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,440
noticed. Come sit down. It feels good to

107
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,400
be a grandparent. Yes, it's special. But

108
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,240
boy, you got to have energy for them.

109
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,880
That little thing is around the corner

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,639
and back before I can turn around. So,

111
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,160
you have lots of tips in the book, very

112
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,400
helpful anti-aging tips, but the one

113
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
that really caught my eye was to don't

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,960
was to avoid being invisible. In fact,

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,880
the tip is don't be invisible. Well, the

116
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,080
truth of the matter is is I think a lot

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:07,919
of women who are 50 or or older feel

118
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,880
that they're no longer as powerful as

119
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,560
they were. And I happen to disagree with

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,160
that because I think we are smarter,

121
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,960
wiser. I think we should run the world.

122
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,199
I

123
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,160
think I

124
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:29,680
mean we are the caregivers of the world.

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,320
We are the the the ones that give birth.

126
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,600
We we do incredible things. And to get

127
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:40,400
to a certain age and I think menopause

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,479
is is is something that women dread. And

129
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,080
I don't think that should be dreaded. I

130
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,560
think it has to be embraced like like

131
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,759
everything God has given us. So as all

132
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,840
this emotion happens in our lives, a lot

133
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
of us turn to emotional eating. You did.

134
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,280
That's part of how you got there. Sure.

135
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,199
How do you recover from that? It's not

136
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,960
just a long-term motivation. There

137
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,320
tactical things you have to deal with

138
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,000
when you want to overcome emotional

139
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,960
eating. Okay. Here's my trick. All

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,960
right. Oh, pay attention. Now, the trick

141
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,199
for emotional eating. The trick is is I

142
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,360
will look at a piece of cake that I

143
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,400
really, really, really want or I will

144
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,800
look at a bowl of berries and I will say

145
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,720
to myself, well, I really want that

146
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,520
piece of cake and I could eat that and I

147
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,479
could probably eat another piece after

148
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,880
that, but what are you going to give me?

149
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,680
Are you going to give me any nutritional

150
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,800
value? And the answer is most of the

151
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,639
time, no. I want that bag of potato

152
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,520
chips. I really do. But you know what? I

153
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,520
look at my berries and I go, "Ooh,

154
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,520
antioxidants."

155
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,319
They're whispering to you. They they

156
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,199
they talk to me. She's the berry

157
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,759
whisperer. And And you know what? I make

158
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,960
my decisions that way. Now, listen. I'm

159
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm not a crazy person. I still eat a

160
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,280
lot of things,

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,639
but I on a daily basis turn around and

162
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,120
say I'm gonna have a protein, a veggie,

163
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,360
and fruit. And I'm proud of you. And you

164
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,960
also like to exercise. So, I've saved

165
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,800
this for the end. I want you to

166
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,599
demonstrate exercise. I never said I

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,800
like it. Oh, I misinterpreted. No, no,

168
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,759
let's get extreme. I misqued the

169
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,919
book. Come on over here. Show me what

170
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,599
you do. You don't like it. What do you

171
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,319
like?

172
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,919
Well, I like to move and I think moving

173
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,919
is important, especially if you want

174
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,160
energy. I want energy. That's my whole

175
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,360
thing. I'm taking my high heels off. I

176
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,120
like this. We can go dancing now.

177
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,199
Perfect. Boy, we could get in trouble.

178
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,319
Yes, we could. Now that you're free,

179
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,160
demonstrate. This is Lorraine's favorite

180
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,960
activity to teach us today. This is a

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,039
30day plank challenge. That's correct.

182
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,840
So, I think this is really hard because

183
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,080
it works your entire body. You're coming

184
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,000
down. I'm coming down with you. Yep. Go,

185
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,599
Dr. Ar. I'm going. All right, we're

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,120
getting in PL. Regular plank. Look at

187
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,199
you. You know it. So,

188
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
ready? Look at that posture. That's Look

189
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,759
at that form.

190
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,039
Look at that tushy.

191
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,479
All right. Now, how do you do this the

192
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,520
first day? This can be hard to do. It's

193
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,479
very hard to do. Very hard to do. I

194
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,680
agree. So the thing is is no matter

195
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,879
where you are in your life, you can do

196
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,080
this for 5 seconds. Yep. Do it for 5

197
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,440
seconds. The next day do it for 10. Do

198
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,919
it for 20 and fight it. I mean, my whole

199
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,919
body is shaking. Okay. But you know

200
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,000
what? I'm going to I'm going to fight

201
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,320
through it. See how stable you are? Oh,

202
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,399
she's like a rock. Oh my goodness. You

203
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,920
cannot tell. She is not invisible today.

204
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:51,120
Lorraco, where are you going? I'm I'm

205
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,240
