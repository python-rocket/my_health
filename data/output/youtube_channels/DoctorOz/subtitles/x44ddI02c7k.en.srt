1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,080
An Oz food investigation. What went

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,000
wrong here? Cheap chicken at your

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
supermarket. There are options that

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,280
won't break the bank, but you have to

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,120
steer clear of a few issues. What to

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,280
look for so you don't get conned at the

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,040
cash register. It is the most overlooked

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,600
chicken in the supermarket. It gets no

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,359
love. Plus, Dad, how's that barbecue?

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,680
Invite the neighbors. The dish crew is

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,680
cooking up backyard barbecue favorites.

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,279
You can grill them, toast them, butter

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,160
them, and grill them, whatever you like.

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,940
Coming up next.

15
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,840
[Applause]

16
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:36,520
[Music]

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,520
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

18
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,300
[Music]

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,450
I love you, doctor.

20
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,450
[Music]

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,399
[Applause]

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,079
We all want the healthiest, cleanest

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,760
meat when it comes to feeding our

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,280
families. But when you're on a budget,

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,359
it can feel like you don't have many

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,680
options. So today, America's Test

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,359
Kitchen's Julia Color Colin Davidson is

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
here going to help us investigate cheap

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,520
chicken to find out what you are really

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,720
getting. Okay, you pay less for it. So a

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,720
lot of folks think you got to spend a

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,479
lot of money, a ton in order to get good

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,240
quality meat, but you're arguing not

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,640
true. There's a secret. And the secret

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,040
is that there are lots of good cheap

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,880
chicken options at the supermarket,

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,479
which is really important because I

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
often say you should buy organic, you

39
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,159
should buy freerange, air chilled, and

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,680
that is the gold standard for buying

41
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,280
chicken, but it's also the most

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
expensive. And quite frankly, that's not

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
always in the budget. So, there are

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
options that won't break the bank, but

45
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,600
you have to steer clear of a few issues.

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
So, that's what we're going to talk

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,159
about. All right, Julia, we're going to

48
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
start off with one of the cheapest forms

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,320
of chicken in the supermarket. I don't

50
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,040
know why it has a bad name, but canned

51
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,119
chicken has people very skeptical. It

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,119
is. It is the most overlooked chicken in

53
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,399
the supermarket. It gets no love, right?

54
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,920
And it sits there on the shelf right

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,520
next to canned tuna, which plenty of

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,920
people like, but as you said, people are

57
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,680
skeptical of chicken in a can. But the

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,520
good news is it's inexpensive and it's a

59
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,960
good product. Well, they get tuna in a

60
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,479
can. Why is tuna fish can in a can?

61
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,399
Chicken's not. Yeah, they're both very

62
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,000
lean meats. And the thing is when we

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
looked uh peeled off the label and we

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,160
looked at what's inside, uh the good

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
news is not a lot of ingredients. Now,

66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
some of the other ingredients, yeah, a

67
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
few cans had a few other things, some

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,440
food starch and maybe some preservatives

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
and some water, but on the whole, this

70
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,440
is a good picture. So, this is a decent

71
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,040
product. I love this. Yeah. So, we

72
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,720
challenged some chicken lovers to come

73
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,160
up with their most creative canned

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,400
chicken recipes. They could only use

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,120
canned chicken. Paula, who had never

76
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
tried canned chicken before, look how

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,160
skeptical she is. Look at that. Look at

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,599
that. Look. still. Yeah, I was a little

79
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,360
skeptical, but I don't I don't believe

80
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,680
in food shame, so I decided, right, I'm

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
going to give it a go. Um, so I started

82
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,560
that. Do you want to try it? What should

83
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,879
you make? So, basically, it's a chicken

84
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,599
tortilla uh soup with canned soup, and

85
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,280
it's easy to make. Yum. Um, and it's

86
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,720
easy if you have children under feet or

87
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
if you have young kids at home. So,

88
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,680
everything's a it's, you know, a

89
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,360
division of one. So, there's one carrot,

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,840
one one celery rib, one onion, garlic, a

91
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,159
couple of cans of canned beans, and then

92
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,760
that canned chicken. It's good. It's

93
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,519
really good. I love it. What do you

94
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,280
think? It's chicken yourself. Good job.

95
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,959
Nice job, Paul. Now, Tina, I hear was a

96
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,159
canned chicken tuna lover, but not a but

97
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,159
actually canned chicken and canned tuna.

98
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,519
You like both. So, that So, that part

99
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,280
was okay with you, but you wanted to

100
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,879
take it to a new level. Yes. I don't see

101
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,480
the chicken. Where's the chicken? The

102
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,120
chicken is in the crust. The the crust

103
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,879
is actually chicken. What? Yes. Oh,

104
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
you've taken like a cauliflower crust to

105
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,879
a whole new level. This is chicken. It's

106
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,480
chicken, parmesan, cheese. Oh, it is

107
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,840
chicken. You can And an egg. And it

108
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,519
makes a crust. Yeah. It's It's It's so

109
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,799
unique and different. And I have a

110
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,360
hungry teenager at home who wants

111
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,920
protein. This is such a smart idea. Well

112
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,519
done. This is delicious. One more time.

113
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,080
How do you crush the chicken down in

114
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,040
this very thin crust? You bake the

115
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,519
chicken uh into almost like flakes for

116
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,040
just a few minutes. Then you put it in a

117
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,920
bowl with the egg and the cheese. It

118
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,760
forms a dough. And then you bake that

119
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,360
for about 10 minutes till it's crispy.

120
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,120
Put your sauce, your cheese, and that's

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
it. And you use lowfat cheese. It's I

122
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
mean it's and it has a meaty flavor. I

123
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
love it. You know, the next time you

124
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,200
know they always ask you what the exotic

125
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
food tastes like and say chicken. Next

126
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,080
time they ask you what the dough tastes

127
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,439
like, say chicken. Chicken, right? The

128
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,799
pizza tastes like chicken. Thank you.

129
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,400
Nice job. Inventive. Thank you. All

130
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,919
right. Next cheap chicken that we're

131
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,519
investigating is chicken in a pouch.

132
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,800
We're seeing this in the exact same

133
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
aisles where we're seeing the canned

134
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,680
chicken that we just were bragging

135
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
about. What are your thoughts on this?

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,919
It's just packaging. Much like tuna has

137
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
gone from the can to the pouch. Chicken

138
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,080
is doing the same thing. But the the

139
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,160
pitfall here is that a lot of the

140
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,400
pouches are flavored. And when you start

141
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,000
adding flavorings, that's when you add a

142
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,919
little bit of some nasty ingredients,

143
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,600
some preservatives, some other issues.

144
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,160
This is all the things that you're Yeah.

145
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,759
You can find all of this in pouched

146
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,919
chicken that has flavoring. And it can

147
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,440
be hard to find plain pouched chicken.

148
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,680
So that's the trick here. If you want to

149
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,560
buy it in a pouch over a can, look for

150
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,520
plain. Next chicken chicken is chicken

151
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,960
packs. Always thought the whole chicken.

152
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,560
Probably the cheapest way of doing it.

153
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
Yeah, sometimes it is. But but now I'm

154
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,520
seeing these bag these bags with, you

155
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,360
know, every chicken breast that you

156
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,960
could ever find. Yeah. So some markets

157
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,440
are just selling this and this is just

158
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,199
raw chicken that's been packaged bulked

159
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,120
together and frozen. So it winds up

160
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,560
being less expensive than individual

161
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,280
items you'd buy from the butcher

162
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,479
counter. Uh but the thing is that this

163
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,120
chicken can also turn out very dry and

164
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,600
freezer burn. So according to the USDA,

165
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,520
freezer burn does not present any safety

166
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
issues. But according to me, freezer

167
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,199
burn is nasty and you should avoid at

168
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,039
all cost. Put the chef at risk. Yeah,

169
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,639
exactly. Will not like you. It does not

170
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,639
taste good. So, there's a few things you

171
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
can do to avoid it. And one is you can

172
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,240
look for ice glazed, which is really

173
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
interesting. They take each piece of

174
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,280
chicken and they glaze it with ice

175
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,600
before they combine it and put it in the

176
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,280
package together. That ice prevents the

177
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,479
moisture from evaporating, but it also

178
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,080
prevents the chicken from sticking

179
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
together so you can get out a portion or

180
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,360
two. Uh, the trick here is you got to

181
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,960
rewrap it really well after you take a

182
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,880
portion out because any air is where

183
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,039
you'll get freezer burn. Ice glaze. Ice

184
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,680
glaze. Sounds like a dessert. All right.

185
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,360
Jill is here with some frozen chicken

186
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,479
that she cooked and she wants to know

187
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,919
why is it. Yeah. When you pull it out,

188
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,479
why does it get all this juice around

189
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,800
it? Yeah. Well, so frozen chicken uh is

190
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,960
often injected with broth or water and

191
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
salt and that keeps the chicken breast

192
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
moist and juicy during the freezing

193
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,000
process, but they leech out during

194
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,199
cooking. So, you get this. Um, and

195
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,479
there's some other things that might be

196
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,560
going on here. So, I'm going to give you

197
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,080
four more tips to think about when

198
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,639
cooking chicken. First, make sure you

199
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,919
thaw it all the way. A whole day in the

200
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,720
refrigerator. That might have been part

201
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,479
of the problem. Oh, yeah. If there's any

202
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,440
ice crystals or anything left in that

203
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,360
chicken, that's just going to come out

204
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,720
as water. Okay. The second thing is you

205
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
want to make sure to pat the chicken dry

206
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,479
really well. Let it sit on a paper towel

207
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,479
for a good 5 minutes. Get all that

208
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,880
excess moisture out before you cook it.

209
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,560
Uh the third thing, don't overcook it.

210
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,400
160 is the magic number for chicken

211
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,000
breast. If you overcook chicken, that

212
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,680
heat is just pushing out the excess

213
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
moisture. So, it's in the pan, not in

214
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,120
the breast. Okay, no extra credit for

215
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,120
overcooking. No, don't worry about that.

216
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,560
There's one more trick here is you got

217
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,080
to let the chicken rest before you cut

218
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,000
it because all that moisture that was

219
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,000
pumped out, as the chicken rests and

220
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,680
those muscles relax, that moisture must

221
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,280
get reabsorbed. So, yeah. So, let it

222
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,880
rest for at least 5 minutes. We'll do.

223
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,520
Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Nice to meet you,

224
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,680
Jill from Philly. Hope that's helpful.

225
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Up next, how to pick out the best the

226
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
best $5 ready to eat chicken in your

227
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
grocery store. That is right. Rissy

228
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,440
chicken buying hacks. They're there when

229
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,440
we come back.

230
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,400
One of the most shocking mass murders in

231
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,400
American history. Jim Jones led over 900

232
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,639
of his followers to their deaths.

233
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,199
Congresswoman Jackie Spear is here

234
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,080
revealing how she survived Jonestown.

235
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,560
Plus, an Oz investigation. All going

236
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,120
undercover to buy a variety of underwear

237
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,960
to find out if contaminated products are

238
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,080
still being sold. In your sample, we

239
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,160
actually detected

240
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,900
next Oz.

241
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,280
That's coming up tomorrow.

242
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:05,440
[Music]

243
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,360
We've been investigating cheap chicken.

244
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,879
Now, America's cheapest and tastiest

245
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,639
ready to eat chicken that has been

246
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,599
making headlines this past year for its

247
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,879
low cost, the rotisserie chicken. Now,

248
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,560
we're going to reveal the secrets to

249
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,560
picking the tastiest one that will give

250
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,479
you the most bang for your buck.

251
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,400
Everyone loves rotisserie chicken. But

252
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,080
first, some supermarkets are selling

253
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,080
this rotisserie chicken for as little as

254
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,720
$4.99. And that easily appeases a family

255
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,720
of four for a little over a dollar each.

256
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,399
So Julia, what is the catch? How they

257
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,320
doing it? Why so cheap? Yeah, it's just

258
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,760
marketing. And supermarkets big and

259
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,919
small are cashing in on this. From

260
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,240
Costco to my little local market, in

261
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,120
fact, Costco, their $5 chickens, it

262
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,279
reportedly sell over 6 million of them a

263
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,720
year. That's a lot of chicken. And my

264
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,560
local market down the street every

265
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Thursday is a five buck clock. It's the

266
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,800
same idea. Five buck. Isn't that a good

267
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,120
name? Now, the thing is, uh, they're

268
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,200
selling this at a loss, right? It's it's

269
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
at or below or around cost. So, they're

270
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,399
not making any profit on this, and

271
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,080
that's called a loss. But the idea is

272
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,320
they're just luring you into the store

273
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,839
with good cheap chicken, and it works.

274
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,959
Well, if you can get good chicken and it

275
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,399
tastes good, and you're not paying for

276
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,240
it, why not? And the name for that is

277
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,839
lost leader. So, this is a classic loss

278
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,519
leader for most supermarkets, but not

279
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,360
every $5 five duck. What? Five buck

280
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,880
cluck. Not every five buck cluck is

281
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,399
worth it. Not every rotary chicken is

282
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,000
going to be created equal. So Jul's got

283
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,920
some insider tricks to picking the best

284
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
one. First off, you got to pick the kind

285
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,440
you can actually watch with your eyes as

286
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,519
it cooks. Yeah. The goal here is to buy

287
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,959
the freshest chicken on the table,

288
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,880
right? So if you see that they're

289
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,399
roasting them on site in the rotisserie,

290
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,920
you know it's a short distance from that

291
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,279
rotisserie to that table and they're

292
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,880
replenishing that table throughout the

293
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,640
day. So that's going to be fresher than

294
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,040
if they're roasting them off site. All

295
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,360
right. And finally, a skin check. Yes.

296
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,959
So I got two birds here. One of them you

297
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,240
think is ideal. The other one not so

298
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,760
much. That's it. And I think actually

299
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,760
it's pretty obvious when this one looks

300
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,839
better. It's more evenly brown. But you

301
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,200
can tell this skin is wrinkly. That

302
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
means remember it's been sitting under

303
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,640
that heat lamp. Moisture is evaporating.

304
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
That means that breast meat isn't as

305
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,480
plump and the skin's wrinkling. So go

306
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,680
for the plumper burn. Yeah. And if

307
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,959
you're if you want to make sure that

308
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,560
you're eating the healthiest rody

309
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,160
chicken of all, look for the one made

310
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,519
without marinades, right? Because the

311
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,959
ones with marinads have a ton of salt in

312
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,160
them. You can also take the skin off. I

313
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,040
don't like to do that personally. I

314
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
don't think it's a big headache.

315
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,399
However, if you're worried about the

316
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,000
calories, it can shave off 170 calories

317
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,240
per serving, at least up to that amount.

318
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,160
Julia, I love your insights. Oh, so nice

319
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,680
to see you. God bless you. Thank you.

320
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,519
Make sure to check out America's Test

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,519
love it. We'll be right back.

326
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,560
Coming up, an investigation into those

327
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,290
fun pool floats that you like to relax

328
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,640
in, but could they be dangerous?

329
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,120
[Applause]

330
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,959
Summer is just around the corner and no

331
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,120
pool party is complete without one of

332
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,880
these inflatable pool floats. We all

333
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
have them. They come in every size and

334
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,079
shape. Just look at these and

335
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,079
celebrities are obsessed with them.

336
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,040
Vanessa Hudgins posted this photo with

337
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,800
her inflatable swan. Reese Witherspoon

338
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,399
is hanging out in this donut. Looks

339
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,720
pretty cute like that. Even Justin

340
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,480
Bieber got in on fun with this flamingo

341
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,240
which has become quite popular. But

342
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,079
before you blow up that float for your

343
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,240
next summer party, we're breaking down a

344
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,640
new study that says you and your kids

345
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,440
could be inhaling dangerous chemicals

346
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,240
while relaxing on one of these floats.

347
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,640
Maros Gavako has more on the story. And

348
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,720
first off, let's talk about how popular

349
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,040
these floats have become. Yeah, these

350
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,200
are very popular with a wide range of

351
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,279
ages. Everyone from little kids to their

352
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,800
grandparents enjoys playing with these

353
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,079
things in the pool. And as you just

354
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,920
pointed out, they've also become a

355
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,519
really trendy prop on social media.

356
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,120
They're whimsical. They're cute. People

357
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
really like them. But here's the thing.

358
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,680
They make a lot of money. One company

359
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,079
estimated that they were selling $20,000

360
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,160
worth of pool toys every day. So, this

361
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,600
is big business. So, what is this study

362
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,079
showing? What's the headline of it?

363
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,040
Yeah. You know that classic pool toy

364
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,519
smell? It almost smells almond like or

365
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,839
rubbery. Well, this study took a look at

366
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,320
the source of that smell and found that

367
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,000
it's coming from chemicals that could be

368
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,760
harmful to children at very high

369
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,560
concentrations. All right. So, the test

370
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,000
was done the study's results showed that

371
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,079
there were very specific chemicals that

372
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,760
they were worried about. Yeah. So, this

373
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,920
test was conducted by German researchers

374
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,120
and what they did was they bought four

375
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,279
pool toys in stores and online and they

376
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,079
found that all four were made of

377
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,000
polyvinyl chloride which is PVC. It's

378
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,839
commonly known as PVC. Most people have

379
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,839
heard of this from being used in pipes

380
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,079
in home construction, but it's also used

381
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,680
in a lot of consumer products from rain

382
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,200
boots to credit cards, even food

383
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
packaging. That's what this stuff is

384
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,480
mostly made of. So PVC again, as a

385
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,560
reminder, is a chemical resistant

386
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,760
synthetic resin that comes in two forms.

387
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,440
There's the rigid form. You see it in

388
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,959
pipes and sheeting material,

389
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,560
construction stuff has it. And then

390
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,240
there the flexible ones like we're

391
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,079
talking about with these plastic toys

392
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,600
that you put in the food pool floats.

393
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,120
Shower curtains have. You ever smell the

394
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
shower curtain? That little smell,

395
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,639
right? These these are plastics that can

396
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,560
be bent. So a lot of you are familiar

397
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,079
with that plasticky smell. It's not an

398
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,600
accident and that smell comes from

399
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,519
adding certain chemicals to that

400
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,360
foundation of PVC. So what are the

401
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,200
health dangers potentially from these

402
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
chemicals? Yeah. So there are three

403
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,959
chemicals that are of concern and they

404
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,279
were found in three of the four products

405
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,120
that were tested. One is a suspected

406
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,279
carcinogen which means it could cause

407
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,519
cancer. One is suspected of causing

408
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,920
genetic mutations and one is believed to

409
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,279
be harmful if inhaled, which is exactly

410
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,880
what's happening when you're smelling

411
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,880
something, you're inhaling it. Right

412
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,200
now, all of this does sound very scary,

413
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,279
but we have to keep in mind that this is

414
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,760
a very, very small study. They only

415
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,160
looked at four toys. Even the

416
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,079
researchers of this study said, "We need

417
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,519
to study it more." So, the takeaway here

418
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,279
is not that these pool toys will make

419
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,959
you sick. It's just that we need to look

420
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,480
into this more. All right, so let's talk

421
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,079
about why these chemicals could be

422
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
dangerous. And who better to talk about

423
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,360
chemicals than a toxicologist? And who

424
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,279
better to talk about these chemicals in

425
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,800
plastic toys than the founder of a camp

426
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,440
aimed at getting young people excited

427
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,160
about science. Luckily, Tamaya Anthony

428
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,480
Tamika Tamika Anthony fits the bill for

429
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,040
both. She's the director of Camp Wakanda

430
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,480
and she's here with her camp kids. Tama,

431
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
can you put your toxicologist hat on for

432
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,920
a second? Explain to us why some of

433
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,920
these chemicals added to PVC could be

434
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,920
potentially harmful, especially to kids.

435
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Sure. In order to make these PVC

436
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,279
plastics, we need to add plasticizer in

437
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,120
order to make them more soft and

438
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,440
flexible so they can make toys like the

439
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
ones you see here. These plasticizers

440
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,360
are usually phalates. Thalates are

441
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
endocrine disruptors. So endocrine, our

442
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,560
endocrine system pretty much regulates

443
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,760
all the hormones in our body. So

444
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,519
interfering with that can lead to

445
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,600
anything from reproductive issues,

446
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,920
obesity, in the case of the children,

447
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,760
developmental issues as well. So the

448
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,320
issue with the chemicals is we don't

449
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,320
really know what the um the exposure can

450
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
be like. meaning that we know that they

451
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,440
smell a little strange, but we don't

452
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,959
know what that translates to as far as

453
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
toxicity, especially because you're

454
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,639
outdoors with these pools, toys usually.

455
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,959
Okay, so going to do a little experiment

456
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,199
with the kids. Take it away. All right.

457
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,560
They're so cute. So, Madison, can you

458
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,680
tell us what this beach ball smells

459
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,600
like? Take a whiff. What does that smell

460
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,760
like? Smells like balloons and plastic.

461
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,920
And it doesn't smell good. Oh, thank

462
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,880
you, Madison. Hey, Bryce, can you tell

463
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:17,279
us what those toys smell like? These toy

464
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:21,360
the toys smell like they smell like

465
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,360
plastic and they they smell weird and

466
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,560
they smell good a little bit. Okay,

467
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,639
thank you. You're tiny little

468
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,519
scientists. My goodness, your whole

469
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,440
generation. Thank you,

470
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,360
Malachi. You got a huge cupcake there.

471
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,240
Can you tell us what that smells like?

472
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,959
It smells like

473
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,480
It's It doesn't smell like a real

474
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:46,320
cupcake. It's It does. It just smells a

475
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,680
little dirty. A little dirty. It was in

476
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,680
storage. It's a very sensitive nose. You

477
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,160
can pick it up. I want our toys dusted

478
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,000
from now on. So, to make what's your

479
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
takeaway? I mean, they smell things, but

480
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,720
we don't know if those orders are a

481
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,920
problem, right? We just we know that

482
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,360
there's a clue, baby. What are your

483
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,360
recommendations for families at home?

484
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,959
Right. So, I don't want to like alarm a

485
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,519
lot, you know, a lot of people because

486
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,199
this the study was kind of small. But,

487
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,199
you know, PBC plastics because they're

488
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,199
endocrine disruptors, they are they can

489
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,440
be potentially harmful. And because we

490
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,920
can't know just by looking at a toy like

491
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,920
what the level of toxicity is, the odor

492
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,360
can sometimes help us along with that.

493
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,880
So, when you're going to the store and

494
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,079
you're picking out a toy, you know,

495
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,399
especially a beach ball, can I borrow

496
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,399
this medicine? You know, take a whiff of

497
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,000
it. If it smells kind of strange, it's

498
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,440
kind of like that nail polish, glue,

499
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,360
almondy, strange plastic smell, then

500
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,199
it's probably has some kind of um

501
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,199
chemicals in it. So, when you take it

502
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,040
home, the best bet is to kind of take it

503
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,720
out and air it out before you actually

504
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,399
use it. Now, I know you guys are

505
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
probably thinking like, if it's toxic,

506
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,480
why do we have the kids smell it? So,

507
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,720
the toxicity is increased with the

508
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,440
amount of exposure. So, prolonged

509
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,959
exposure to plastics like these can be

510
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,639
potentially harmful. So, it's okay that

511
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,320
we had them kind of smell it today. It

512
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,519
might be okay in the pool, too. And the

513
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,880
amount that we get exposed to might be

514
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,079
okay no matter where you are with it. We

515
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,600
just don't know that, which is why it's

516
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,799
good to ask these questions. So, good

517
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,160
advice for everybody is don't be scared

518
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,559
of the pool floats. I want you out there

519
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,679
having fun. Thank you much for bringing

520
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,600
the kids as well for the camp.

521
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,160
Congratulations.

522
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,600
We wanted to talk to the vinyl institute

523
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,640
and they did send us a statement back.

524
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,559
They're very thoughtful about it. They

525
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,559
said odor alone is not the best

526
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,640
indicator of a health risk. In addition,

527
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,480
the study uses a very small sample size,

528
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,839
only four items, which is insufficient

529
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,039
to produce statistically significant

530
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,960
data. And then they go on to say that

531
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,039
PVC, which we talk about it's inert,

532
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,280
it's odorless, it's safe to use, and

533
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,880
additives used in some flexible PVC

534
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,400
products, can produce the odor, maybe

535
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,000
that the kids are smelling here, does

536
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,880
not mean that pool floats can cause

537
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,400
harm. We're going to put the full

538
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,640
statement online so you can all read it.

539
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,559
Up next, a lifeguard, a real lifeguard,

540
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
weighs in on what your family needs to

541
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,960
know about these floats. And this has

542
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
nothing to do with the smell. Here's

543
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,360
some tips from my green expert, Tony

544
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,440
Harris, on how to enjoy pool floats

545
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,440
safely. If you're worried about

546
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,880
chemicals and pool floats, here are a

547
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,880
few simple tips to reduce your exposure.

548
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
If you're worried about the smell, just

549
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,240
take them out of the package and let

550
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,400
them gas for a few days before you use

551
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,640
them. Don't use your mouth to blow them

552
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,240
up. Use a pump or electric style air

553
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,640
machine like you would use for your car

554
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,000
tires. Never leave pool floats out in

555
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,919
direct sunlight when you're not using

556
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,360
them because it could create more fumes.

557
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,320
If you're looking for greener solutions

558
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,840
for pool floats, consider these. Pool

559
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,919
noodles are made from polyethylene,

560
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,120
which some believe may be less damaging.

561
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,600
And if you worry they're not as

562
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,760
Instagrammable as blow-ups, just get a

563
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,760
little creative.

564
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,440
Where do we go when we die? We're

565
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,640
unraveling this medical mystery and

566
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:51,240
examining the last moments of life.

567
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,240
That's coming up Friday on Dr. Oz.

568
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,600
We're taking a deep dive to learn more

569
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,679
about these pool toys. And now a safety

570
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,160
warning from a lifeguard. George is one

571
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,799
of our med unit interns on the show, but

572
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,559
for nearly 10 years, he was a certified

573
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,080
lifeguard. These pool floats are very

574
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,000
popular. A lot of parents load them to a

575
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,039
false sense of security. Let's start off

576
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,280
with explaining the difference between a

577
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,720
pool float and a flotation device that

578
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,640
the lifeguard might tell you to put on

579
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,600
if you're on a boat, for example. Yeah.

580
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,440
So, a pool toy, as we can see, we got a

581
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,960
quite a few here, are just that. They're

582
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,120
toys. They actually even have a label on

583
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,440
them that says this is a toy, not to be

584
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,200
used as a personal flotation device. On

585
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,559
the other hand, personal flotation

586
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,480
device, better known as like a life

587
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,440
jacket, is something that has to go

588
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,679
through US Coast Guard uh approval. That

589
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,919
being said, neither one of these

590
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,840
substitute for close adult supervision

591
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,919
and good swimming skills. So you hear

592
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,480
that parents, audience, everyone home,

593
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,840
even if there's a lifeguard on duty,

594
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,880
sometimes we don't have eyes in the back

595
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,120
of our head and there could be hundreds

596
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,320
of children in the water and we need

597
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,480
your help because we want to keep

598
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,200
children safe. So one thing I had not

599
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,799
thought of is these these pool toys may

600
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,200
actually be a hindrance, right? They may

601
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,440
make problems more more of an issue.

602
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,600
Absolutely. So, uh, for instance,

603
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,400
sometimes there's, uh, floaties that go

604
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,760
on kids' arms or even these, they can

605
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,160
clearly get in the way of your line of

606
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,480
vision, so you can't see what the

607
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,240
child's doing. Especially if one falls.

608
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,679
Another thing I know as soon as one of

609
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,760
these big boys went in the water when I

610
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,280
was younger, we'd all start pushing each

611
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,120
other off it, try and play king of the

612
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,360
hill. I mean, mom put a Not you, but

613
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,400
other people. Okay. Not me. No, other

614
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,000
people who didn't become medical

615
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,640
students. Mom put a pretty quick end to

616
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,240
that. So drowning on a serious note is

617
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,480
the second leading cause of accidental

618
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,159
deaths for kids under the age of 14.

619
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,400
It's common. So let me show you what can

620
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,159
happen when a child is on a pool float.

621
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,080
Whether they're wrestling or not, this

622
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,320
becomes an issue. So let's just say this

623
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,919
little bowling pin is your child, right?

624
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,200
And there's nothing to hold on as often

625
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,799
there isn't on these toys or they're

626
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,280
playing king of the hill or they bang

627
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
into the side, right? And it flips over.

628
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,039
And when it flips over, now you got a

629
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,039
couple issues going on. Child's in the

630
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,120
water. Depending on how deep the water

631
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,840
is, the child is now trapped beneath the

632
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,559
float sometimes. But more importantly,

633
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,400
out of sight. That's the thing that's so

634
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,960
important. Some of these larger floats

635
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,120
that people have, they limit your view.

636
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,039
So, you're seeing the pool, it looks

637
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,480
pretty calm, but underneath here,

638
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,240
there's really a big issue. You're

639
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,080
distracted. So, a child's drowned

640
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,440
without us even noticing it. So, in a

641
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,679
situation like this, how long does it

642
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,039
take for a kid to drown in a pool? As

643
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,120
you can see, it just takes seconds for

644
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,960
them to become submerged. In two

645
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,799
minutes, a kid can become unconscious

646
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,799
and within five minutes, they can suffer

647
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,640
from irreversible brain damage due to

648
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,159
lack of oxygen. So, let's give some

649
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,679
rules of the road, right? Rules of the

650
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,280
pool, we'll call them. First, limit the

651
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,200
amount of kids per float. I know it's

652
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,799
hard to do. Do your best. Don't buy too

653
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,120
many of these oversized floats. It just

654
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,960
invites more problems. And designate a

655
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,720
parent to keep their eyes on young

656
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,000
swimmers at all times. Don't trust

657
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,080
they've been the lifeguard. You take

658
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,760
responsibility. Never hurts to have a

659
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,960
belt and suspenders, both you and them

660
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,000
checking it out. You can take turns

661
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,679
throughout the day so you're not just

662
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,280
staring at the pool uh for your entire

663
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,440
afternoon. George, thanks very much.

664
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,440
Nice job in the med unit. We'll be right

665
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,440
back.

666
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,720
We are gearing up for the unofficial

667
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,320
kickoff to summer this weekend. And what

668
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,480
is Memorial Day without the perfect

669
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,679
backyard barbecue? Today we are grilling

670
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,320
up my simple but delicious big fat Greek

671
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,880
burgers. Oh jeez. Oh yes. And margarita

672
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,159
marinated ribs. We're getting all up in

673
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,159
your grill. So stick around. Oh my

674
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,720
If there's one thing that brings us all

675
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,960
together, it's food. So, we're calling

676
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,960
everyone to the table to dish on

677
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,360
everything from the latest food hacks

678
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,080
and trends to everyday recipes you can

679
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,080
make for dinner tonight. It's simple.

680
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,280
It's celebratory. And most of all, it's

681
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,679
about having a great time in the

682
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,720
kitchen. What is going on? I'm trying to

683
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,720
help. Let's dish.

684
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,480
Welcome to the dish on us. And we are

685
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,000

686
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,840
summer this weekend and we have some

687
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,520
backyard barbecue recipes you're going

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,960
to add to your menu no matter where you

689
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,200
are. My daughter Daffy's here with her

690
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,760
foodie friends, TV host and bestselling

691
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,280

lifestyle champa Ali's back in the

695
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,080
kitchen. Oh yeah, I like it. And of

696
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,919
course, she's at some of the biggest

697
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,240
food network shows and she's a superstar

698
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,080
in many ways on TV and off. Daffany,

699
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
what's on the menu today? First up is a

700
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,960
simple and delicious backyard barbecue

701
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,200

perfect side. And then we're going to

709
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,760
give you an inside look at how a chef

710
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,840
shops the big box stores to find the

711
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,520
very best food. Okay. Pat show today. So

712
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,400
before we get cooking, let me ask you

713
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,919
one thing. In one word, tell everybody

714
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,840
what is the best thing about a backyard

715
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,679
barbecue.

716
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,200
For me, it's the smell. Cuz that smell

717
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,640
of that charcoal going like that's how

718
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,640
you know whose house you going to. It's

719
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,039
like they cook it. You don't like that's

720
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,600
how you follow the nose. Okay. I like

721
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:13,840
that. I just think of sauce. Ooh,

722
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,000
sticky sweet.

723
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,919
See sauce. I like sauce. I love the

724
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,679
sounds of kids yelling and screaming.

725
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,120
That's what I like cuz they compete and

726
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,120
do things to build up an appetite so you

727
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,840
can feed them. I like that too. Saw,

728
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,640
sound, smell. Maria, I just like being

729
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,120
outside. And so for me, it's just being

730
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,440
outside and hosting people and having

731
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,039
everybody jumping in pools and then like

732
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,039
grabbing a burger and then jumping back

733
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,720
in and, you know, hopefully not

734
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,400
drowning. Your chain. You're definitely

735
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,520
everyone comes to your house. I feel

736
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,720
like Did you hear that? I love that.

737
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,360
like the cutest thing ever. Um, for me

738
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,679
it's I it's eating with my hands with a

739
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,679
bib sometimes, but at least leaned over

740
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,480
the

741
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:00,240
bib on. If you invite me to your saucy

742
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,559
outside smelling sounding, don't drown

743
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,679
pool party. I am there and I am I am

744
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,320
there for the win. Okay, taking that

745
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,640
picture and posting it.

746
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,679
butt as apple. Make sure these are not

747
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,760
like you guys. Maria, well, you live in

748
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,120
LA, too, but Maria lives in LA and your

749
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,799
family does love to use your backyard

750
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,559
barbecue all year round, which I'm so

751
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,640
jealous. Look, we got this cute picture

752
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,400
of you cooking like that Thanksgiving

753
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,840
dinner because we were renovating our

754
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,840
house and we didn't have a kitchen to

755
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,840
cook Thanksgiving in. So, my mom said,

756
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,840
"Well, we'll cook outside." So, I didn't

757
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,400
realize, gosh, you can cook anything in

758
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,320
there. We made lasagna in the grill. I

759
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,320
love that. Like the first Thanksgiving.

760
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,000
Exactly. Took us back to the beginning.

761
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,440
The grill can do so much. And today

762
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,440
you're going to show us your world

763
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,080
famous mokos burgers. Talk me through

764
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,600
this recipe dish. So a mkos burger. It's

765
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,520
a lot more exciting than just your

766
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,080
average burger. So we've got some feta

767
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,919
cheese, some parsley, some dijon

768
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,760
mustard, garlic powder. You can use

769
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,200
fresh garlic if you want fresh garlic,

770
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,880
but I like to give you the option of the

771
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,799
powder cuz it's in your cabinet

772
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,799
generally and it's usually there. So

773
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,039
that's nice. So you mix that all

774
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,880
together. A little dijon mustard and you

775
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,120
add this little ingredient which is a

776
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,559
sauce.

777
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,840
Depends on where you live. Worcester. I

778
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,240
don't know how to say it properly.

779
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,919
Woristers. Woristers. Yeah. There's no

780
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,679
way. There's no way those letters come

781
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,240
together. Woresir. Anyway,

782
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,240
British is wor. The Turkish. No, the

783
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,840
Turks don't have any. It's got vinegar

784
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,159
and garlic and onions and all that good

785
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:35,279
stuff. But the real secret ingredient,

786
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,880
anchovies. Wait, anchovies or wishes?

787
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,279
Yes. Read the label now. Ew, I hate pull

788
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,279
it out like that.

789
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:50,200
You're already adding wishes. It's

790
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,200
already a contain.

791
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,559
Okay.

792
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,240
It's the best. It's already in. You're

793
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,919
already adding it to the burger. In just

794
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,600
the smallest form. Why do you love

795
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,840
anchovies so much? It's got the umami.

796
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,360
It takes take those taste buds. Not the

797
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,180
sweet and sour ones. The ones that taste

798
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,200
real

799
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,640
[Laughter]

800
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,559
you're taking her down. You're taking

801
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400
the champion without that yumami

802
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,400
excitement. The MKOS border burger is

803
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,320
not the MKOS burger. This is making it

804
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,760
happen. You're welcome.

805
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,520
Dr. Oz, reset. Reset. So, okay. So,

806
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,559
we're going to Somebody is going to make

807
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,240
this patty for us. Right here. Right

808
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,919
here. We're ready. We got the patty. And

809
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
we're going to throw it on here. Throw a

810
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,440
little olive oil, which this is all

811
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,080
really hot. Now, I got to ask you, are

812
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,520
you a Are you a mix with your hands kind

813
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,200
of? Thank you. Are you a mix with your

814
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,200
hands? I'm a mix with my hands. I wash

815
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,799
my hands frequently. I love that you're

816
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,640
like totally commanding this right now.

817
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,919
Like, how do we use this and make it not

818
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,120
as hot right now? No, don't do that.

819
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,799
Just going to blow it up in my face.

820
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,000
Guys, we're going to have an explosion.

821
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,200
No, we're going to get a little water in

822
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,960
this pan. We're going to cool it right

823
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,640
down. This is cooking with a hot grill.

824
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,640
That is one of the tips to making sure

825
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,679
that this is what it would look like. It

826
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,520
would look like you found your house

827
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,440
because of that smell right there. So,

828
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,000
here's what I love about this. So, a lot

829
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,840
of people don't like to eat bread. And

830
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,840
this is such an interesting delicious

831
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,440
burger. You can eat totally plain like

832
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,960
this because of the feta cheese and the

833
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,600
stuff in there. And then we also make

834
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,039
our zitziki. So, Dr. Oz obviously

835
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,799
chopping up the cucumbers for the Well,

836
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,320
in Turkey, this is what we eat all the

837
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,080
time. And we gave it to the Greeks as a

838
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,000
present. Thank you. He just wants you to

839
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,520
rise. Did you guys Are you saying you

840
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,360
created this? Well, you know that. Of

841
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,200
course. I I think the Greeks created

842
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,200
everything. Dr. Oz, back out of this

843
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,399
conversation. We can we can look this

844
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,840
up. But we got some yogurt. We mix the

845
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,799
the the the pureed cucumber. Just to be

846
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,880
clear. So, you take the you take the

847
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,440
cucumbers that I cut up. You pure and

848
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,799
then you strain them. So, to take some

849
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,000
of that water out. Yes. You have to

850
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,000
strain them. And then you add the

851
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,039
garlic, the dill, the lemon, throw some

852
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,640
parsley in there, and you make zazziki

853
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,919
sauce. And I want to make sure everyone

854
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,679
knows how to say zaziki.

855
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,000
Guys, here's the test. He's already

856
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:07,760
dancing. Zaziki.

857
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,600
Zaziki. Zadiki. Zaziki. Yes. Papa.

858
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,080
Now what you do is you can spread it on

859
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,600
top of your burger or on your bun and

860
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,600
you have a mkos burger. Now as we finish

861
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,200
these mokos burgers. Yeah. And you can

862
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,399
do some sliced cucumbers on there too.

863
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,440
You and your dad had a big hamburger

864
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,039
tradition. We did. My dad used to love

865
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,880
this little hamburger stand. It was like

866
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,520
a hole in the wall, but he used to take

867
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,320
us there after school, but their meat

868
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,440
was always seasoned really well. But I

869
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,799
could tell and I love the way you put

870
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,919
all that salt in there because that's

871
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,840
what really brings out the flavor. I

872
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,440
told you guys before, Wolf Gang Puck

873
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,200
taught me that it's all about like

874
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,120
really layering in the salt and pepper.

875
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,720
I used to be so scared to put salt and

876
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,600
pepper on there. You got to really like

877
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,880
dose it to make it good. So, you know,

878
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,880
great. That's the beauty of cooking at

879
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,120
home also is you're controlling it.

880
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,760
You're dripping

881
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,600
juice on

882
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,080
ruining my burger. Oh, I'm trying to

883
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,919
help. Ew. Well, on that note, up next,

884
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,000
Jamaica's margarita marinated barbecue

885
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,399
ribs. There's no anchovies in them.

886
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,320
Plus, actress and food Daniel Ramirez is

887
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,840
dropping by with what will be your go-to

888
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,240
barbecue dish this summer. You're going

889
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,720
to love it. Amen. Not on the anchovies.

890
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,880
Let's go. I love getting to talk with

891
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,799
you on my show every single day, but

892
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,200
when the cameras stop rolling, the

893
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,960
conversation is not over. I still have a

894
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,360
lot that I want to talk about. So

895
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,279
download the Dr. podcast on Apple

896
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,480
podcast or wherever you get your

897
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,919
podcast. So yes, we always get like

898
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,240
right to the intro if that's not where

899
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,240
we want to start.

900
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,120
All right, we are too excited to wait

901
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,600
for Memorial Day. So we are throwing a

902
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,960
backyard barbecue today. And just like

903
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,720
in just like in real life, my dad cannot

904
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,159
wait to eat. He is sitting down with

905
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,720
some of the audience members chowing

906
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,159
down already. Dad, how's that barbecue?

907
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,279
I tell you what, there's food in my

908
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,039
teeth. You like this food? Oh, fabulous.

909
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,480
Keep making the food over there. All

910
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,159
right, we got some more dishes coming up

911
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,080
for you. Well, my favorite thing about a

912
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,240
barbecue is when friends drop by. So, we

913
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,760
invited a very special guest today.

914
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,520
She's starred in some of your all-time

915
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,240
favorite shows from The Sopranos to

916
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:14,159
Devious Maids. And she'll be in Jumanji

917
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,159
coming up next. Jumanji the movie. Da

918
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:21,679
Ramirez. Welcome to the

919
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,120
great. Hi. Um, so obviously we love

920
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,120
food. We all love food. Where did your

921
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,720
love of food start? Well, I grew up in

922
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,039
Dominican Republic with a bunch of

923
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,640
families. So, I grew up smelling food.

924
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,799
Exactly.

925
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,559
Um, and then, you know, my my

926
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,919
grandmother, my aunts, everybody would

927
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,519
cook all the time, but it wasn't until I

928
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,159
was like 12 years old and I was living

929
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,240
in America that my parents both had to

930
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,000
work. And so, it became like a chore at

931
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,159
the beginning. Like, I had to cook one

932
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,080
day, my sister had to cook the next day.

933
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,840
And then I eventually found such a love

934
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,000
for it. It was so therapeutic. It

935
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,720
reminded me of home. You know, food is

936
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,320
love. Yep. Right. So, it just it felt

937
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,000
like the right thing for me to continue

938
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,679
to do in life. But you're right. It is

939
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
it's food is love and it's also the

940
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,559
universal language and it's the kind of

941
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,919
thing that can transport you. So, if

942
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,440
your family's missing, you know, home,

943
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,559
it's a kind of nice thing. But I heard

944
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,919
the first time you cooked for your

945
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,240
husband, which can go both ways. Um

946
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,880
things went up in smoke quite literally.

947
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,799
You know, I almost set my my

948
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,799
mother-in-law's house on fire, you know,

949
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,399
the deck outside. So, it was my first

950
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,159
time with the barbecue and you know,

951
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,000
he's from Columbus, Georgia. Barbecuing

952
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,840
is very big in Georgia. So, he was

953
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,240
outside and he leaves me with the with

954
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,559
the burgers and he leaves me with the

955
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,919
with the sausages and I'm texting my

956
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,360
friend and I'm like, "It kind of smells

957
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,360
like it's something's burning." So, I

958
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,000
open up the barbecue and sure enough,

959
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,799
like flames go everywhere. I panic. I

960
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,799
grab a bucket of water from the pool and

961
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,200
I threw the water into the into the

962
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,039
barbecue. And I have to say like I

963
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,880
ruined the burgers, but then we ordered

964
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,480
in, we all laughed about it and it made

965
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,679
me have no fear, you know, and that's

966
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,960
that's the thing. You shouldn't be

967
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,720
afraid of the barbecue. Well, I am

968
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,720
grateful that you are doing side dishes

969
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,120
today. You got on the grill. You guys,

970
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,039
she's legit. Like she like travels and

971
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,240
wherever she travels, she takes culinary

972
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,399
classes. Yes. I just went real. Yeah. I

973
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,720
went to India this past November. I

974
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,799
spent 21 days in India. And so this is

975
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,640
why and I when I we'll talk about my my

976
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,720
special dish a little side dish a little

977
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,640
later. I integrated um some of the

978
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,399
Indian flavors. I love that. So you're

979
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,000
bringing your travels home. So you're

980
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,679
making a side dish to go with Jamaica's

981
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,440
ribs. What's the deal? I'm like I don't

982
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,120
know if they have this in India, but I

983
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,120
am doing spicy margarita marinated ribs.

984
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,120
It's a cool formula when you're using

985
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,440
booze in your marinade cuz you have to

986
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,360
have the acids cuz that like break down

987
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,760
the proteins and you kind of roll with

988
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,440
that and then and it tenderizes it. So,

989
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,600
I have some baby back ribs, and you put

990
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,159
it in the the spicy margarita. I say

991
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,320
make one for yourself first, and then

992
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,600
you put the rest on the ribs, and you

993
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,240
let this marinate. You put it in the

994
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,240
refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours to let

995
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,399
all of the that tequila and everything

996
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,480
just soak into the the ribs. So, then

997
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,760
when you pull it out, you'll pat it dry

998
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,919
to make sure you get all that moisture

999
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,519
off because we want to have a good sear

1000
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,039
on the outside. So, then we'll have this

1001
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,760
going. And then you just do you can do a

1002
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,119
little bit more oil on the top there.

1003
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,639
And then you just do salt and pepper

1004
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,720
because we don't have to do anything

1005
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,599
else because it has all the flavor of

1006
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,359
everything that was in the margarita. So

1007
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,960
you see where I'm going with it. I love

1008
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,520
it, right? Just do a little pepper

1009
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,280
margarita. And if you will, my da my

1010
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,079
Dominican love. Will you put this in the

1011
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,760
oven for me? I love to. And it's smells

1012
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,599
delicious, guys. Because here's the

1013
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,200
important thing. Like remember there is

1014
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,359
alcohol in that. So, if you're doing it

1015
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,119
on an outdoor grill, put it on like the

1016
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,639
cooler side of the grill because it will

1017
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,079
start to smoke and then you don't want

1018
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,079
to set your mother-in-law's house on

1019
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,599
fire like this one over here did. You

1020
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,839
don't want to do that. You're not afraid

1021
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,240
of the grill. She said afraid. You

1022
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,599
always have a great story to tell. A

1023
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:52,960
great story at 911 on Speed. Yes. And

1024
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,879
you can have any store barbecue sauce.

1025
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,480
And my little tip to you, don't tell

1026
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,880
anybody I told you. Put a shot of the

1027
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,880
margarita in the sauce. I'm telling you,

1028
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,480
everybody will be happy. If the kids eat

1029
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,720
it, they're going to go to sleep like

1030
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,119
nobody's business. You're giving some

1031
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,560
bad parenting advice today, people. Take

1032
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,560
it with a grain of salt. Everybody will

1033
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,240
be happy. Trust me. No, you just add a

1034
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,079
little hint of the margarita back sauce.

1035
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,920
You baste it. You look like you've been

1036
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,079
sweating over a hot grill all day. And

1037
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,160
you have it. So, are you guys drunk over

1038
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,599
there on your

1039
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,320
You've been eating the ribs. Are you

1040
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,480
drunk yet? It smells It does smell

1041
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,160
margarita, by the way. So good. All

1042
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,560
right. So, we have the ribs. We got to

1043
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,920
have a side dish. Absolutely. So, I

1044
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,400
don't know if you guys have ever had

1045
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,160
street corn, right? It's with a queso

1046
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,000
fresco, a little lime, and we're going

1047
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,520
to make it a little spicy. So, that's uh

1048
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,599
where where it all came from. That's my

1049
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,599
whole thing. So, uh what you want to do

1050
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,760
is take your corn cob, raw corn, right?

1051
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,800
Now, there you go. Raw. You're going to

1052
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,680
brush the ghee. And this is one of my

1053
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,520
India ingredients. Your Indian here

1054
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,680
rather than butter. Right. Yeah. Instead

1055
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,400
of butter. So, you're going to brush the

1056
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,560
ghee on your corn, right? Done with

1057
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,560
that. And then you want to add your

1058
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,800
seasoning salt. And then you have two

1059
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,680
kinds of chili here. It looks like this

1060
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,200
is the red chili. Yes. Chili pepper. And

1061
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,520
this is cayenne pepper. So, I'm only

1062
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,839
going to use a little bit of the chil

1063
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,920
heat coming into this kitchen. Okay.

1064
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,480
See, I would be like crazy. My corn

1065
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,480
would look so red right now. I would be

1066
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,839
like, you want to you don't want to you

1067
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,119
don't want to do too much. People who

1068
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,119
are eating at my barbecue is going to

1069
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:29,760
have smoke coming out of every hole just

1070
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:33,680
like I also have kids.

1071
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,000
You got to careful with you have kids.

1072
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,920
And what happens to

1073
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,640
I don't know those tips. Turn it. We

1074
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,960
roll it up nice like this. Goes right on

1075
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,720
the grill. Goes around this goes over to

1076
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,720
the grill about 20 minutes. You turn it

1077
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,160
every 2 minutes and then you're done.

1078
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,680
But it comes out looking like this. And

1079
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,280
this is your finishing step, right? You

1080
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,599
got a little lime juice right on top.

1081
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,119
Lime juice on top.

1082
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,839
A little fresco on top.

1083
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,280
Yum. And then if you want it to be a

1084
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,119
little spicier, you can use your cayenne

1085
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,440
pepper. Now's the time. Wait, Dad,

1086
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,359
you're over there manning the grill. I

1087
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,000
have been manning the grill. These are

1088
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,839
hot off the press. Perfectly done as

1089
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,520
instructed by all of you. This really

1090
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,200

Jamaica allowed our cameras to tag along

with her while she shoed for a backyard

1138
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,000
barbecue at Costco. Check it out.

1139
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,200
Hey guys, today I'm going to one of

1140
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,960
America's favorite stores, Costco. Now,

1141
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,880
there are a lot of shopping secrets to

1142
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,599
reveal here. So, I'm going to show you

1143
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,680
what a chef for and buys so your dinner

1144
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,920
can be chefw worthy, too. Come on, let's

1145
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,040
go.

1146
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:27,000
[Music]

1147
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,000
Let's head to the meat department.

1148
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,520
Here's my chef's secret. I buy choice

1149
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,079
beef, not prime. Now, Choice is just a

1150
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,400
grade down, so it's less expensive, but

1151
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,960
it's great quality. And if you ask me,

1152
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,760
it's actually a beefier taste than Prime

1153
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,400
cuts. And this right here is my pick,

1154
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,560
the choice cut rib. It is perfect for

1155
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,599
pan searing, and it has a wonderful fat

1156
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,839
to meat ratio.

1157
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,839
Next up is rotisserie chicken. Now, I'm

1158
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,160
not talking about these famous birds.

1159
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:00,560
Mm-

1160
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,119
I'm talking about this. It's the same

1161
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,040
delicious cooked rotisserie white meat

1162
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,000
with all the bones removed. So that

1163
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,720
saves you and me a lot of time and so I

1164
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,800
can make my chicken salads, enchiladas,

1165
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,880
tacos. You see where I'm going with

1166
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,800
this. Right on to produce.

1167
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,440
Now these are two of my favorites.

1168
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,599
Papaya and pre-cut pineapple. Now not

1169
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,000
having to cut pineapple saves me so much

1170
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,400
time. And both of these are natural meat

1171
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,960
tenderizers. They go perfect in so many

1172
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,880
of my Caribbean dishes. The bottled

1173
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,680
herbs and spices here are so much

1174
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,680
cheaper than the supermarket. The pink

1175
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,960
Himalayan salt. Okay, I know you're

1176
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,359
thinking, "What am I going to do with

1177
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,440
this much salt?" But it lasts forever.

1178
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,200
And uh anything you have left over, put

1179
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,839
a little scoop in your bathtub for a

1180
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,200
soak, people.

1181
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,640
Now, we're headed to the freezer

1182
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,640
section. My chef's secret here.

1183
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,040
It's wild caught Gulf shrimp. Now,

1184
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,400
they're delicious and domestic. So, you

1185
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,359
can really trust where they come from,

1186
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,800
and that's important. And at this price,

1187
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,520
uh, I am sold hook, line, and sinker. H,

1188
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,319
I'm feeling it.

1189
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,000
I have one final pit stop. Uh, can I see

1190
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:19,200
these diamond earrings, please?

1191
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,160
I mean, come on. A chef's got to look

1192
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,359
her best, right? Okay, I definitely need

1193
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,359
to check out now.

1194
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,240
That That's a great garnish.

1195
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,920
I hope you take those home. If you win

1196
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,440
as your chef, you can buy that. No, I'm

1197
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,640
going to take Dr. Oz's black card next

1198
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,680
time. We're buying diamonds for

1199
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,200
everybody. That's what we're going to

1200
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,319
do. I know people want to know what's

1201
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,359
the whole audience. Okay. So, tell us

1202
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,720
what we're eating cuz we're having fun.

1203
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,160
All right. So, what I bought at the

1204
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,720
store, you saw I bought the shrimp and

1205
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,800
this is a shrimp roll with pineapple

1206
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,200
iioli. So, think like a lobster roll,

1207
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,800
but we put shrimp with fresh pineapple

1208
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,760
in there. It's got aoli with like a

1209
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,440
sweet chili sauce. M I love it. Diamond

1210
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,200
in Costco. I am going to run wild and

1211
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,000
bring you something good. What? What?

1212
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,760
Get my diamond. Get a diamond. I found

1213
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,599
the diamond in my sound. Are you kidding

1214
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,520

1215
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,319
other one.

1217
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,839
proposal. All of a sudden, it's in your
