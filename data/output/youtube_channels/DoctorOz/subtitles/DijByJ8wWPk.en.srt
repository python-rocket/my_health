1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,120
Exclusive shocking new details in the

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,919
case of a doomsday cult mom whose

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,800
children Tylie and JJ haven't been seen

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,280
since September. After fleeing Idaho,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,240
Lori and her new husband Chad Del were

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,119
found 3,000 miles away at a Hawaiian

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,240
resort, but incredibly still won't

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,240
reveal where Tyl and JJ are. Today,

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,279
we're taking you inside the storage unit

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,960
Lori abandoned back in Idaho. Will what

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,840
authorities discovered there finally

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,079
cracked the case? And does the man seen

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,079
on this surveillance video hold the

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,079
answer to what happened to Tylie and JJ?

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,040
Two days before Thanksgiving,

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,280
authorities in Rexburg, Idaho, executed

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,399
a welfare check after family members

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,239
reported 17-year-old Patty Ryan and her

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
seven-year-old special needs brother

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,000
Joshua JJ Valow hadn't been heard from

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,800
in two months. Their mother, Lorie

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,960
Valow, and her new husband, Chad Del,

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,280
the Doomsday author, reportedly

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,680
excommunicated from the Mormon church,

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,920
claimed that JJ was visiting a friend in

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,400
Arizona. Authorities determined this to

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,880
be false and returned to the Debbell

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,520
home, only to discover the couple had

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,759
fled. Some members of Lor's family have

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,600
said they fear she's part of a cult

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,400
focused on preparing for the end of

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,799
time. Shockingly, Lorie married fifth

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,360
husband Chad just weeks after his wife

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,759
Tammy died, reportedly of natural

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,240
causes. But now Chad is a person of

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,960
interest in her death. Tammy's body was

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,119
exumed in December, and autopsy results

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,280
are still pending. The couple has been

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,520
associated with at least two other

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,640
mysterious deaths, including Lor's

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,119
aranged fourth husband and her brother.

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,439
But more pressingly, Tyler and JJ's

43
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,240
family is desperately focused on finding

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,640
them alive. Especially JJ's

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,280
grandparents. JJ, please call Papa. You

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,479
know how to do it. I'm waiting for you.

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,640
Please, little man. Call me.

48
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,280
>> Meanwhile, authorities track down Lori

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,879
and Chad in Hawaii. But still, there's

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,120
no sign of the children.

51
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,360
After Lori ignored a court order to

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,680
present Tylie and JJ to authorities in

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
Rexburg, the Idaho Department of Health

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,920
and Welfare was ordered to conduct

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,680
formal investigations into the child to

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,520
the to the safety of these kids. Now,

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,840
that report was due to a judge

58
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,239
yesterday, but as of this taping, their

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,640
findings have not yet been made public.

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm joined now by East Idaho News.com

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,720
news director Nate Eaton, who tracked

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,879
down Lori and Chad in Hawaii. So, Nate,

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,280
where are they now? Well, last report,

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,040
they are still in Hawaii. In fact,

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
several members of the local church

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,840
there say that they came to church on

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,840
Sunday. They went to meet with the local

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,920
leaders there and they said, "We don't

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,080
want to cause any disturbances. What you

70
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,080
have heard on television is lies. It's

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,160
one-sided." And they seem to just be

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,959
living their lives as if nothing is

73
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,560
going on, as if everything's normal.

74
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,720
>> Well, Nate was in Hawaii investigating

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,200
this case when authorities seized Lori

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,239
and Chad Del's rental car. After that,

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
he attempted to interview them.

78
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,000
>> Where are your kids?

79
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,680
>> No comment.

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,159
>> No comment. They've been missing for 4

81
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,360
months. You have nothing to say.

82
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,560
>> Listen, just tell people what's

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,400
happening. There's people around the

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,840
country praying for your children,

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,959
praying for you guys. Why don't you give

86
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
us answers?

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,080
>> That's great.

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,599
>> That's great. That's great that they're

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
praying for you, praying for your kids.

90
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,120
What?

91
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,480
You have nothing to say.

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,879
>> You have nothing to say. I mean, how

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,480
surprised you were you by by Lori and

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,400
Chad Dable's demeanor?

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,560
>> You know, they were pretty cold. I spoke

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,400
to them for three minutes. I asked them

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,000
29 times. 20 questions. 29 questions.

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Where are your kids? It's an easy

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
question, Dr. Oz. You know, I could ask

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,959
you, where are your kids right now? I

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,879
can tell you where my kids are. It's not

102
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,200
a hard-hitting question. They ignored

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,959
question after question after question.

104
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,120
They did not want to answer anything.

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
>> Can I go to this storage unit issue a

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
little bit because there might be some

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,799
clues in there. You actually were just

108
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,400
inside the storage unit. You brought

109
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,879
some footage back to us. What did you

110
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,879
discover in that storage unit in Idaho?

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,680
>> So, two days ago, we got into the

112
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,600
storage unit that Lorie Del went and

113
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,680
rented on October 1st. You can see here

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
some of the items, mainly children's

115
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,600
items. There's a jersey with the last

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,360
name of Colby, Lorie's oldest son.

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,000
There's ice skates. And then shocking

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,040
these blankets that have photos of JJ

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
and photos of Ty just folded up, stuffed

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,680
in a tote, and left in this cold storage

121
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,840
bin along with bikes and scooters and

122
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,639
photo albums, baby books. I mean, there

123
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,479
were pictures of of photos of these kids

124
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,680
when they were just children, just tiny

125
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,600
little babies.

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
>> Yeah. Who who who puts all their kids

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,000
paraphernalia in a storage unit? So the

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,199
the kids were last seen in September

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,720
when they were pulled out of school.

130
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,919
That's right. You know when Lori started

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
renting the storage unit?

132
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,040
>> She went to the storage facility,

133
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,240
according to surveillance images, on

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,720
October the 1st. And then she and a man

135
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,600
or sometimes two men visited the

136
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,199
facility 10 times between October 1st

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,120
and November 24th.

138
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,600
>> So the surveillance footage they

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,680
referring to uncovered that Lori and a

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
man who appears to be her brother, Alex

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,880
Cox, visiting the unit together and then

142
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,160
removing some heavy stuff, a tote with

143
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,600
something hanging over the end. You'll

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,680
see it there. And then there's also it

145
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,600
looks like there's a tire or something.

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,360
Alex's truck uh was with him u or if it

147
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,680
was really in fact him and they were

148
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,400
spotted several times at the unit in

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
October. So when was Lori last seen at

150
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,880
the unit?

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
>> Well, they went nine times in October

152
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,759
and then nothing until November 24th.

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,560
Lori and and a man went back to the

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,600
storage unit. 2 days later, police went

155
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,840
to her home to do a welfare check on JJ

156
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,400
after his grandparents became concerned.

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,479
JJ was not there. The next day, they

158
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,160
went back with a search warrant. They

159
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,080
searched the house and then they went

160
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
back to that storage unit and that's

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,520
when they they searched this unit and

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,320
they took photos and and documented it

163
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
all.

164
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,280
>> Just to get you all on the same page

165
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,199
here, a surprising number of people

166
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,400
connected to Lori and Chad Del have

167
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,199
passed away. Back in July, Lor's fourth

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,520
husband, Charles, was killed by Lor's

169
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
brother, Alex, who I just told you was

170
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,639
the person who might have been in that

171
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,639
storage unit, suspiciously bringing

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,360
things out. Certainly, his truck was in

173
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,479
the storage unit area. Then Chad's wife,

174
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,960
Tammy Debel, died suddenly in October.

175
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,360
She was only 49 years of age, so it's a

176
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,840
little bit strange. And then most

177
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,280
recently, Lor's brother, Alex, the one

178
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,800
who shot her her fourth husband and and

179
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,800
killed him, who the one who was

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,440
potentially at the storage unit, um,

181
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,440
mysteriously died in December. Do

182
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,800
authorities think that Alex might have

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,479
known where the kids are? Do they think

184
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,160
that was him carrying that tote with

185
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,880
something hanging out of it outside of

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,199
the storage unit?

187
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,080
>> Well, it definitely was his truck and

188
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,240
then he mysteriously died a few, you

189
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,440
know, months later after this. So, one

190
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,880
would assume that he might know

191
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
something that the authorities are being

192
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,520
very tight-lipped about what he may or

193
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,199
may not have known.

194
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,199
>> There's a part of the story that starts

195
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:12,960
to make me very concerned. After Lor's

196
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,960
husband died that Charles, they there

197
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,680
was a service dog that JJ had.

198
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,840
>> Yeah. And apparently that dog was

199
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,039
initially offered on to be sold and then

200
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,360
subsequently because you can't sell

201
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,520
service dogs was given back to the to

202
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
the group that could you know recommend

203
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
him.

204
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,560
>> Yeah. The dog's name is Bailey, a

205
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,639
Labradoodle and JJ has autism. So it was

206
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,039
his best friend. You know Ba Bailey and

207
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,120
JJ were together all the time. Charles

208
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,520
dies and within two or three weeks we're

209
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,479
told that she tried to sell this dog for

210
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,919
a couple thousand dollars online. That

211
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
makes you wonder why was she trying to

212
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,280
sell her son's best friend? And luckily,

213
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,800
the organization that trained this dog

214
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,479
found out about this and said, "Listen,

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,240
you can't sell this animal. We need it

216
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
back." And fortunately, the dog's been

217
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
placed with another child, we're told,

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,720
who has special needs, but why would she

219
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,840
try to sell her son's service dog?

220
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
>> Nate, help me understand what's

221
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,919
happening in Lor's mind because the this

222
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
story just is not coming together for

223
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
why was she doing this? What does she

224
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,280
think is happening? Well, her husband

225
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,120
who was shot and killed was so concerned

226
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,039
about a year ago that he went to a court

227
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,360
and asked for custody of the children

228
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,599
because she was saying that she the

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,000
second coming of Jesus Christ would be

230
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,520
coming in July 2020, the world would

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,840
end. and that um she had been

232
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,640
reincarnated several times and she had

233
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,919
actually said if if you get in my way

234
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,000
you may die and Charles told friends

235
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,200
told family members if anything happens

236
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,760
to me look to Lori. So there were

237
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,000
concerns a year or more ago that she was

238
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,080
becoming involved in you know religious

239
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
delusions and things like that enough

240
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
that her ex-husband raised these

241
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,320
concerns.

242
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,399
>> What do the folks in Idaho think? I

243
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,440
mean, this is a state that people join

244
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,760
know each other pretty well. What do

245
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,120
they think is going on with any of these

246
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,160
weird things? Tyl and JJ's

247
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,519
disappearance. Are they putting the

248
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,200
pieces together?

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,519
>> There are so many questions. This is

250
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,680
probably the most bizarre case eastern

251
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,440
Idaho has seen, I don't know if you

252
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,600
could say ever. I mean, there's so many

253
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,000
complicated pieces. The big question

254
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,640
that everybody has and and could be

255
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,360
answered, where are the children? You

256
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,519
answer that question and this big chunk

257
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,440
is solved. whether you know they're

258
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,040
they're still here and heaven forbid

259
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
they're not here. Just answer that

260
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,399
question and the parents could do that.

261
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,160
>> They could do it easily. But they

262
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,720
ignored your questions 29 times.

263
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,399
>> Yeah,

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,760
>> that would be quite a bit more, I'm

265
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,120
sure. You can follow all of Nate's

266
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,000
wonderful reporting on this disturbing

267
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,440
case at east idaho.com. Congratulations

268
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,640
and keep pursuing them.

269
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,640
>> Thank you, Dr. Os.

270
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,320
>> Shed light. Coming up, missing

271
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
seven-year-old JJ's grandparents are

272
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,279
here with shocking new details on the

273
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,320
search for JJ and his big sister, Tally.

274
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,560
why they say this previously loving mom

275
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
has turned into a monster.

276
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,880
>> Listen, just tell people what's

277
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,800
happening. There's people around the

278
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,240
country praying for your children,

279
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,360
praying for you guys. Why don't you give

280
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,399
us answers?

281
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,480
>> That's great.

282
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,000
>> That's great. That's great that they're

283
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,839
praying for you, praying for your kids.

284
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,880
What?

285
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,800
You have nothing to say.

286
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,360
That's footage of one of the only times

287
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,440
Tori Valow and her new husband Chad Del

288
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
have been spotted publicly since news

289
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,720
broke that Lor's daughter Tylie and son

290
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,839
JJ are missing. JJ's grandparents Kay

291
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,279
and Larry are back with us today. H how

292
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,600
shocked were you both to learn that Lori

293
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,680
was in a resort, a very expensive

294
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,680
multi-million dollar gated community in

295
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,839
Hawaii while the rest of the world is

296
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,760
looking for her children.

297
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:45,040
You know, it's one thing to rub it in

298
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,680
the public's face and to rub it in law

299
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,200
enforcement's face,

300
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,360
but to rub it into the to the extent she

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,560
has, as you say, the million-doll

302
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,000
community laying on the beach,

303
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,240
that's the mind of a very sick person.

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,040
And I want to feel sorry for her because

305
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,600
we knew the other side of Lori.

306
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,240
>> So K, you've gone from believing Lori

307
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,959
was a loving mom to thinking she's a

308
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,279
monster that ought to be in jail. What

309
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,200
happened to her? She I it's like uh I

310
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,079
don't know exactly when she and Chad

311
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,399
met, but they're leading a path of

312
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,760
destruction everywhere around them that

313
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,839
they've been all the way from Arizona to

314
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Idaho to Hawaii. I mean, and all of us

315
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,800
back in Louisiana,

316
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,360
I mean, there there's a lot of people

317
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,040
that have been hurt by this. And we had

318
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,920
spoken to um a couple of people that a

319
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,600
couple and the husband had been involved

320
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,040
in that for a little while and it

321
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,640
>> been in the involved in the cult.

322
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,760
>> Yes. And this is probably 50 families

323
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,720
that have been affected by this in in a

324
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,720
very bad way.

325
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,600
>> In a in a very small town,

326
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,240
>> right?

327
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,680
>> There's one person that I wish I could

328
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,079
stand here and talk to and he would look

329
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,959
me in the eyes.

330
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,160
Chad, let's you and I sit down. Let's

331
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,519
get a cup of coffee.

332
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,600
>> Chad D.

333
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,000
>> Chad Chad, the doomsday author.

334
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
>> Absolutely.

335
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
>> And Lor's husband.

336
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,920
>> And and Lory's husband. And Chad, let's

337
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,040
sit down. You got to explain to me how

338
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,800
this happened.

339
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,680
>> So Kay and Larry haven't been able to

340
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,279
speak to JJ since August. He and Tylie

341
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,440
haven't been seen by anyone since

342
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,760
September. And we now know that Lori put

343
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,120
their belongings into a storage unit in

344
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,399
October. So, Larry, how hard is it to to

345
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,839
see JJ's loved items in storage? That's

346
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,839
his scooter, which I I understand.

347
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,440
>> Yes.

348
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,959
>> It It hurt. It hurts. That scooter right

349
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,399
there.

350
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:02,240
The first thing he does in the morning,

351
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,399
he goes and he gets his scooter and he

352
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,000
runs up and down. We're fortunate. We

353
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,920
live on a dead end road and he's got a a

354
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,040
a

355
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,639
lot of road to ride on.

356
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,680
We were buying him new tennis shoes

357
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,040
about every seven days

358
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,760
>> from riding that scooter.

359
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,720
>> He he he wears out the left foot pushing

360
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,320
and dragging and

361
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,360
>> dragging So when that scooter's in

362
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,560
storage and his his his dog, his service

363
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,639
dog is given back to the organization

364
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,000
after she tried to sell it, I mean, what

365
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,560
what does that mean to you? What does

366
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,399
that signify to you?

367
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,200
>> It it means what I don't want to hear.

368
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,200
It it to me

369
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
it's

370
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:59,519
I we don't use the the dword.

371
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,880
>> We can't. But it means to me is that

372
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:07,600
somebody, his mom,

373
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:12,120
his uncle were cruel enough

374
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,120
to either put him someplace

375
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,920
or something else

376
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,800
and not take really the two or three

377
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,600
things that he loves the most. I I see

378
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,199
that scooter and and that's what it

379
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,120
makes me feel like. I am so friaking

380
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:36,000
angry. I I want to get in a room with

381
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,480
them and just

382
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,040
I want to hurt them.

383
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,639
I know better. I'm not going to do it.

384
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,680
Good Lord's going to take care of that

385
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:51,040
for me.

386
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:55,360
It's I I'm I'm not I I I I'm I'm not

387
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,079
going to depend on anybody else. I'm

388
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,560
going to turn it all over

389
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:06,320
to the Lord because we we can't I can't

390
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,600
take justice out on myself. Even as bad

391
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,040
as I want to, I don't I can't serve that

392
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,079
justice that way.

393
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,839
>> So, let me shift gears. Chad Del, Lory's

394
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,920
new newest husband, fifth husband,

395
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,839
allegedly said his wife, Tammy Spirit,

396
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,720
helped them connect with Lori.

397
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,240
>> Yeah,

398
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,800
>> that's why they were able to get married

399
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,680
so soon after her untimely death.

400
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,399
>> Right. She is an innocent victim just

401
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,839
like Charles is an innocent victim. Just

402
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,560
like JJ, just like Tyle, just like us,

403
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,560
just just everybody in their world. Lori

404
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:44,000
has just exploded it. and for her own

405
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,440
selfish needs or desires.

406
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,360
>> If I understand correctly, you think

407
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
there are people in Rexburg, Idaho who

408
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,680
have more information, but they're

409
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,519
afraid to talk about it.

410
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,240
>> Afraid to speak up. What's your message

411
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,639
for them?

412
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,920
>> Please, please, please. This is easy.

413
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:05,199
This is about two children. It's that

414
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,040
simple. This is about two children, two

415
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:14,880
beautiful children. And all we want to

416
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:17,279
do is is somebody in Rexburg, somebody

417
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,320
around that community, somebody around

418
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,880
that part of the state. They have to

419
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,639
have seen something. So if you know

420
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,360
anything about the disappearance of JJ

421
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,480
Valow and Tyler Ryan, please go to findj

422
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,920
and tylie.com. There's a $20,000 reward

423
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,440
for information directly leading to

424
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,120
their recovery. This family has lived in

425
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
states all over the country. So, we

426
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
really need to spread the word and find

427
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,920
JJ entirely. We're going to have all the

428
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,920
contact information you need at

429
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,920
dr.com/crimehunters.

430
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,480
Godspeed. We're all praying for you.

431
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,519
Keep pushing.

432
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
>> Thanks, Dr. Oz.

433
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,320
>> Thank you.

434
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,360
>> Coming up, if Lori and Chad Del have

435
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,440
been lying to authorities, why why

436
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,800
haven't they yet been arrested?

437
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,120
>> We're back with the latest on the search

438
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,360
for brother and sister JJ and Tylie, who

439
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,680
were last seen in Idaho in September.

440
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,559
Their mom, Lori, and new stepfather Chad

441
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,880
Del have now been discovered 3,000 miles

442
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,039
away in Hawaii, but continue to refuse

443
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,360
to cooperate with authorities. Joining

444
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,199
us now to try to make sense of this is

445
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,720
former homicide prosecutor and host of

446
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,319
Investigation Discoveries True

447
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,240
Conviction, Ana Nicolasi. So, Lori Valow

448
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,679
was given five days to present her kids

449
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,839
back to the police, to the authorities.

450
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,199
That deadline passed. She's still

451
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,559
wandering around in Hawaii in a million

452
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,160
dollar gated community. Why don't they

453
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
just throw her in jail? Well,

454
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,919
technically they can, but it's much more

455
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,760
complicated here. If you don't comply

456
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,760
with a judge's order, you can you can be

457
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,919
put in jail until you comply. But here

458
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,039
you have competing factors. You have

459
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,880
one, they are in Hawaii. The order came

460
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,240
out of Idaho, so you'd have to ask

461
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,679
Hawaii. Of course, they're going to help

462
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,000
on a case like this, but they have to

463
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,080
extradite them. You also have the fact

464
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,080
that they are out and about. Who knows?

465
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,559
The authorities's number one priority is

466
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,480
to find these children. And we all want

467
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,440
to hope against hope that these children

468
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,039
are found safe while she is out. Maybe

469
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,960
she does something that leads them.

470
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,559
Maybe she decides to cooperate or more

471
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,720
likely she does something, says

472
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,480
something, goes somewhere that helps

473
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,960
police. So that's what they're looking

474
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,320
at here. And that I believe is what

475
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,679
they're doing. They can't tell us a

476
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,120
whole lot because in Idaho you're

477
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,039
dealing with children. There's lots of

478
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,039
laws about the investigation being under

479
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,559
seal. But I think we can all be rest

480
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,400
assured they are doing everything they

481
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,960
can to piece this together as quickly as

482
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,880
they can.

483
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,240
>> I guess we're all anxiously wanting them

484
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
in jail for justice, but that's not

485
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,640
really justice. Justice is finding these

486
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,120
kids.

487
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,240
>> That's first.

488
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,880
>> So letting letting them make more

489
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,440
mistakes while they're out and about is

490
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,720
rational.

491
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,520
>> The case can come later. It's finding

492
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,880
these kids first.

493
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,640
>> Case will definitely come later.

494
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,280
According to Rexburg police, before Lori

495
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,280
and Chad fled Idaho, they claimed JJ was

496
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
visiting friends in Arizona, which was

497
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,360
not true. They also apparently told

498
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,360
witnesses that Lor's daughter, Tylie,

499
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,760
died a year before the death of her

500
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,200
father, which also wasn't true. And

501
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,880
around the same time, Chad allegedly

502
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,400
told another witness that Lorie had no

503
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,280
minor children. Also not true. So these

504
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,200
are pretty significant lies that folks

505
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,400
are swearing they were told. So

506
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,160
authorities, I would think, would be

507
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,320
able to charge Lori and Chad with

508
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,400
something. You know, as a homicide

509
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,320
prosecutor, I've had countless

510
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,120
conversations with families like the

511
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,799
Woodcocks. And the end of the day is

512
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,240
while I absolutely understand the

513
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,600
frustration and the pain and how are

514
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,360
these people out and about while we know

515
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,880
that they're lying left or right, it is

516
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,120
not a crime to lie. It may be fantastic

517
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,880
evidence against them. If there is are

518
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,440
charges later, which unfortunately I

519
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,120
suspect there will be, that is when

520
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,640
these come into play. We reached out to

521
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,480
Lori and Chad Dable's attorney for

522
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,480
comment and we have not heard back, but

523
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,840
previously gave a statement saying, "We

524
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,919
look forward to addressing the

525
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,000
allegations once they have been moved

526
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,200
beyond speculation and rumor. If you

527
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,799
have any information on the

528
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,039
disappearance of JJ and Tally, go to

529
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,919
find JJali.com. We also have all the

530
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,520
information as usual, dr.comers."

531
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,799
As you can, thank you very much. Thank
