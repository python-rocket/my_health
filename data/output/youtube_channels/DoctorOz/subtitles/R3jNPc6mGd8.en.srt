1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,600
Today is salad safe to eat again?

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,839
Recall. This lettuce recall is

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,440
nationwide outbreaks. Parasite outbreak

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,840
triggers recall. Contamination.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,160
Contamination is widespread. We go

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,160
inside the lettuce industry. The leaders

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,279
of today's top brands answer the tough

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,439
questions. Plus, can you overdose on

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,600
probiotics? New headlines raise the

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,160
question, is it too much of a good

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:31,519
thing? Coming up next.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:36,200
[Music]

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,200
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,980
[Music]

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,120
I love you

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,120
[Music]

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,920
guys. You hesitate at the salad bar or

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,160
think twice before buying bagged salad.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,399
Well, maybe. Maybe you wonder, is it

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,079
safe to eat salad again? Consumer

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,760
confidence is down when it comes to

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,519
lettuce safety. And it's no wonder. It

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,360
seems like every day there's another new

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,920
headline about a food born illness

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,520
outbreak with lettuce as the culprit. So

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,119
today, for the first time, we're going

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880
straight to the source. In just a few

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,280
minutes, you will hear directly from the

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
lettuce industry leaders who out there.

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,119
We're going to find out what they're

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,720
doing to keep your salad safe. Take a

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,759
look.

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,000
The Roma scare hit hard with epic panic

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,200
over the E. coli outbreak, leaving

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,439
Caesar salad and rap lovers afraid. Ever

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,680
since the Roma lettuce scare last year,

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,240
I've just been very unsure if I should

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,439
feed my family romaine lettuce. I've

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,759
read the headlines and now I'm

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,479
horrified. Is it less safe to buy bags

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,040
of lettuce or heads of lettuce? Every

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,079
year, one in six Americans get sick from

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,720
food. That's 48 million people. And

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,720
lettuce is frequently implicated. More

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,119
people getting sick from lettuce linked

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,680
to an E.coli outbreak. This year, the

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,920
largest E.coli scare in over a decade

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,520
stemmed from people eating greens grown

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,640
in this part of the country, Yuma,

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,319
Arizona. But those Yuma greens were sold

51
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,160
nationwide. People in 36 states got

52
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,720
sick. Almost a hundred were

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,760
hospitalized. And five even died before

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,760
that crisis was over.

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,800
And just this month, the FDA and CDC

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,800
along with state and local officials

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,200
wrapped up their investigation into

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,400
another multi-state outbreak linked to

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,239
greens. This time it was cycllos

60
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,519
parasis. From salads consumed at

61
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,200
McDonald's, but officials weren't able

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,720
to identify a single source of

63
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,360
contamination. From romaine to all the

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,920
salad greens you love. Today, lettuce

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,720
industry insiders and brands are

66
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,720
answering your

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,319
questions. Let's look at what food born

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,840
illnesses look like. This little

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,599
parasite here, it looks like the death

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,800
star from Star Wars, right? It's called

71
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,280
cycllospora, which recently caused a

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,519
large outbreak thought to be linked to

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,360
fast food salads. I mean, this thing

74
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,840
there's not bacteria. They're little

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,280
proto little little parasites. Then

76
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,360
there's salmonella, right? You've heard

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,959
of salmonella. Has these little hairike

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,400
things. They're known as psyia that help

79
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,920
them move through your system. It's one

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,599
of the most common causes of food

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,680
poisoning in the United States. It's not

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,760
so pretty when it's inside of you. And

83
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,720
then there's this little guy elegantly

84
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,040
swimming. See my motoring along here,

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,519
right? It's called E.coli. This is the

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,760
bacteria behind the Roma outbreak

87
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,000
earlier this summer. Again, these are

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,599
spectacular species, but not when

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,360
they're attacking you. So, when you eat

90
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,120
something contaminated by one of these

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,360
bad boys, you'll feel it. Most people

92
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,680
just get vomiting. They'll get diarrhea.

93
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
But a few thousand Americans do die from

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,720
the effects of food born illness every

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
year. So, it's important we track these

96
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,400
outbreaks. We asked Consumer Reports

97
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,159
chief scientist James Dickerson to help

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
us understand what happened with

99
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,920
lettuce. I should point out during the

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
Roma outbreak last summer, Consumer

101
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,640
Reports advised consumers to stop eating

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,879
Roma even before the government issued

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,879
warnings. So, you're ahead of the game

104
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,319
and thank you for being there. Do you

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,000
think we're just reporting this more

106
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,720
often? Are we truly having more food

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,280
born outbreaks? So, the simple answer is

108
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,120
we're not entirely sure. It could be a

109
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,759
little bit of both. We certainly have

110
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,479
rapidly growing population. Uh we have

111
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,479
more sources of food, but there's more

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,320
media coverage. So it could be really a

113
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,240
combination of both. And why is lettuce

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,919
so problem problematic? I mean it's it's

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,000
the best food force. Why is it the

116
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,360
culprit? So as you mentioned the center

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,080
for disease control uh stated that 20%

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,479
of all food born illnesses related to

119
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,160
ecoli particularly come from leafy

120
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,240
greens. The thing is is that there's

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,720
nothing intrinsically wrong with

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,280
lettuce. No, it's it's what we're doing

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,600
to it. Walk me over here and show me the

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,360
major steps of contamination. And James,

125
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
you know this area really well. So,

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,400
we're going to break it down. There are

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,520
basically five ways that lettuce, poor

128
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,600
old innocent lettuce, because it's

129
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,759
usually a bystander, gets contaminated.

130
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,160
Okay. Step number one has to do with

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,400
these beautiful wildlife. Wildlife, they

132
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,560
trounce around our fields and near our

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,600
fields. They might fly overhead and

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,080
leave things if you know what I mean.

135
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes. Darn birds, rabbits.

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,600
The next

137
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,600
thing is the water sources. And so,

138
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
water can get easily contaminated. The

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,960
sprinkler systems can get contaminated.

140
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,160
And this we believe is the source uh for

141
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,680
the recent uh ecoli uh outbreak uh in

142
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,600
Yuma, Arizona. Contaminated canal water.

143
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,720
Right. So both the both the tubes but

144
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
also where they get the water from.

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,360
Water from Exactly. And then know the

146
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
people making the the harvest.

147
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,639
Certainly. We have our workers that have

148
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,720
gloves and boots, their their tools.

149
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,919
They're handling the food uh each and

150
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,320
every time. Exactly. Next we have the

151
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,800
factories. Now imagine food coming from

152
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,680
all around the country coming into one

153
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,759
location and you have just one potential

154
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,919
uh source of contamination. It could

155
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,600
crosscontaminate the entirety of the of

156
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,800
the food system. And then and then

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,960
lastly it's that last part of the farm

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,639
to table last mile. Yeah. The last mile

159
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,400
which is your grocery store all the way

160
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,080
to your home can all be sources of

161
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
contamination. James, thank you very

162
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,720
much. Very very helpful. Thank you so

163
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,120
much.

164
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
So this alarms me so much because

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
there's a lot of fear amongst computer

166
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,520
among consumers like you when it comes

167
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
to eating leafy greens and you know

168
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,560
they're so essential to healthy eating

169
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,560
that I don't want to take them away from

170
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,039
you. So for the first time a lettuce

171
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,600
industry insider is appearing here for

172
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,919
you. Please welcome Scott Kosfall who's

173
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,360
the CEO of California Leafy Greens

174
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,520
Marketing Agreement. That's the group

175
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,360
that creates the regulations that keep

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,639
salad safe for us folks who are the

177
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
salad lovers like me. Appreciate what

178
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,560
you do. So you say it comes down to a

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,800
culture of food safety and how we

180
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,160
actually grow our lettuce and produce

181
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,560
the product. Explain what does that

182
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,280
mean? Well, to me, Dr. Oz, a culture of

183
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,440
food safety exists when everybody in an

184
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,840
organization from the management to the

185
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,080
farm worker to the supervisors, they all

186
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,919
recognize that protecting public health

187
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,840
is their number one priority. And I'll

188
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,240
give you one example. The industry used

189
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,039
to be based on speed. What's really

190
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,360
changed in the last decade or so is that

191
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,680
if a worker spots an issue or a

192
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,720
potential issue, even if it slows down

193
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,880
production, even if it means uh say a a

194
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,960
a machine needs to be cleaned and and

195
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,400
sanitized, they're commended for that.

196
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,919
And to me, that's what a culture of food

197
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
safety on the farm is all about. So,

198
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,280
break it down for us. You brought us

199
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,960
some exclusive views of what it actually

200
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
looks like. There's a harvest training

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,199
video, and it's what you're trying to

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,479
use to change the culture. So, what are

203
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,599
the safety measures actually taken? And

204
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,680
we're going to start off with water

205
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,599
since it's the probable culprit in the

206
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,160
most late in the latest outbreak, right?

207
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,759
There's uh a lot of focus on water in

208
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,840
the from the recent outbreak. So, we've

209
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,919
always required all of our members to

210
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,000
test their water. They test it every

211
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,560
month, but we've just recently added

212
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,080
some changes to our standards uh for

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,400
situations like what we just went

214
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,560
through. uh and we're going to see more

215
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,160
water treatment for instance so that

216
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,759
farmers can be even more sure that

217
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,000
they're they're using water that's safe

218
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,840
and and uh adequate for its and what

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,520
about animal contamination? Animal

220
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,759
contamination is a real issue. We grow

221
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,479
products outdoors. Uh there are a lot of

222
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,280
environmental concerns um from rodents

223
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,759
to birds to you name it. Um and so

224
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,520
farmers will uh every day they do an

225
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,000
inspection and if they see any signs of

226
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,000
animal encroachment they'll they'll mark

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,599
that part of the field off occasionally,

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,759
not often. They may walk away from an

229
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,839
entire field, but they will not harvest

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,519
anything that's uh that's been deemed.

231
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
And what about us? Human contamination.

232
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,599
Well, we grow or we harvest most leafy

233
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,599
greens by hand still. So, workers are

234
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,000
very important to that process. So, we

235
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,600
have a host of uh requirements for

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,600
workers. Handwashing is really

237
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,399
important. Uh we've created a a

238
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,040
handwashing app that growers can use to

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,040
train their workers. Um everything is

240
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,720
being done to make sure that the product

241
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,480
is as safe as it could be. Scott, thank

242
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,120
you for trusting the process, for taking

243
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,959
an insidider look. Thank you. into our

244
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,600
living rooms. I think it'll help address

245
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,959
some of the fears consumers have. Now,

246
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,240
when we, you know, I've said this many

247
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,440
times, we believe that when it comes to

248
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
what you eat, you have the right to

249
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,640
complete transparency. So, today we're

250
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,080
actually holding a salad summit. For the

251
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,839
first time ever, one of the biggest

252
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,660
brands, Dole, is actually here answering

253
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,480
your questions directly. Stay with us.

254
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,399
[Music]

255
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,120
He would say, "Shut up or I'll kill

256
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,360
you." All new Oz. True Crime Tuesday is

257
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,920
back. How new DNA science helped crack

258
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,959
the case of the Golden State Killer.

259
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,060
This guy is the devil on Earth. That's

260
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,480
coming up

261
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,480
[Music]

262
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,480
tomorrow. A lot of you are worried about

263
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,160
recent lettuce recalls, but fear and

264
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,040
food should never go together. So today

265
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,959
we're hosting a firstofits-kind salad

266
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,640
summit. We want to create a safe space

267
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,959
for you to interact directly with the

268
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,720
people who know your produce best. So we

269
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,480
have invited three representatives from

270
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,120
the salad industry to answer questions

271
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,800
from our audience

272
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,680
members. First I want to welcome to our

273
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,680
salad selling panel Natalie Dansson. She

274
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,200
is the vice president food safety and

275
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,480
quality at one of the biggest lettuce

276
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,399
brands Dole. John Boltz is also joining

277
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,640
us, the first vice president for Arizona

278
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,640
Farm Bureau and he's also a grower,

279
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,800
knows firsthand what it takes. And Tommy

280
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,399
Advidor, food safety consultant who

281
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,240
knows about food germs at restaurants,

282
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,079
grocery stores, and especially in your

283
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,320
home. So Natalie, there are a lot of

284
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,320
misconceptions, a lot of fear around

285
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
food born illnesses. Why was it so

286
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,399
important for Dole to be here today?

287
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,640
Well, I think as consumers when you hear

288
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,480
about food safety rec food food safety

289
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,079
issues or recalls or things like that in

290
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,399
the news, it's easy to forget we have a

291
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,320
really safe food supply in this country.

292
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,000
And for Dole, we're committed to

293
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
transparency. We're committed to being

294
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,279
an innovator and a leader in the

295
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
industry. And we really wanted the

296
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,720
opportunity to come and talk to

297
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,399
everybody about the standards that we

298
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,839
have and the practices in the US that

299
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,480
are really designed to protect the

300
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,519
consumers. We invest millions of dollars

301
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,480
every year like many companies do in

302
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,079
research, in innovation, in um expertise

303
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,839
just to make sure we're producing safer

304
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,680
products. Give me an example of what you

305
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,000
do with Dole to make the food supply

306
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,320
safer to make salad easier for people to

307
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
trust. Yeah. Well, we have robust

308
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,680
controls all the way through the

309
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,000
continuum. It starts in the field. So,

310
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,000
we have practices that our growers

311
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,600
adhere to in the field during harvest,

312
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
during transportation, cooling, all the

313
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,640
way through our processing facilities.

314
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
Everything is intentionally designed

315
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,839
with those controls to ensure that the

316
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,839
product is kept safe. And John, if I can

317
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,839
turn to you, you're a grower. Yes. You

318
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,560
speak for growers. We just saw a video

319
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,160
about food safety tactics, things that I

320
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,279
could imagine some workers using, some

321
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,560
not. How do you make sure that

322
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,760
everyone's trying to follow the rules

323
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,480
even though they might seem not

324
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,320
applicable to them? Well, Dr. Oz, the

325
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,640
the best thing that we can do is rely on

326
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,120
the best science. So, as a grower, I go

327
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,800
to preeminent minds in that field of

328
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,279
science like those at the University of

329
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,440
Arizona that are leaders in the world in

330
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,680
food safety and pathogens and keeping

331
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,760
them out of our food. And we work handin

332
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,440
glove with them and we develop uh

333
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,600
training for our employees and we work

334
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,959
through the whole process and uh it's

335
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,720
really it's really important. It's

336
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,279
something that we're passionate about as

337
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,600
a grower and uh we just love providing

338
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,959
safe food for people. That's what we do.

339
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,959
You're okay with some questions now from

340
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,320
the audience? Absolutely. All right. So

341
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,440
Nicole, you're gonna go first, right?

342
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
And I understand you have a question for

343
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,760
Natalie and John. I haven't eaten

344
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,720
lettuce since the outbreak. Is lettuce

345
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:35,279
safe to eat again? Absolutely. Um, you

346
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,959
know, we are consumers, too, and we eat

347
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
the product and we serve it to our

348
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,000
families and the health and nutrition

349
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,680
benefits of eating fresh fruits and

350
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,959
vegetables far far outweigh any

351
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,639
perceived concerns that there are

352
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,680
associated with these products. I

353
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,880
absolutely agree. eating leafy greens is

354
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,800
is absolutely safe. And uh I just wanted

355
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,880
to say, you know, the lettuce that I

356
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,120
grow in my fields that is shipped all

357
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,160
over the United States and Canada, it's

358
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,160
on your plates at restaurants, you take

359
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,160
it home to your family, Dr. Oz, that's

360
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,320
the same lettuce that I harvest in my

361
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,639
fields and take home to my family. Go

362
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
next. Jasmine. Hi. Is eating bagged

363
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,800
lettuce less safe than eating regular

364
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,399
heads of lettuce? No. All lettuce comes

365
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,920
from the same place. It's all grown the

366
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,519
same way. It's all harvested the same

367
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,120
way. It's really a matter of convenience

368
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,480
for customers. Can you address something

369
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,800
that I read about sometimes, which is

370
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,720
that when when it's pre-bagged for you

371
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,680
or washed, someone has to touch it. So,

372
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,079
how do you know it's not getting

373
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,760
contaminated then? Actually, human hands

374
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,440
don't actually touch the product, we

375
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,200
take a lot of care during the wash

376
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
process and during handling to ensure

377
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,240
that there is no going to be any

378
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,600
contamination. We can save some time. My

379
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,360
good. I've been shying away from it.

380
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,519
Joan, you've got a question. Hi. What

381
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,399
can we do when we take lettuce home to

382
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,240
make sure that we clean it properly?

383
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,399
So research shows that if you do have

384
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,480
ecoli on the lettuce, the bacteria

385
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,320
itself actually goes into the crevices

386
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,639
within the lettuce. So you can't wash it

387
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,440
off. Um, but there are things that you

388
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,360
can do um to keep lettuce safe. You

389
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,720
actually can wash it in a colander. The

390
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,560
colander actually prevents it from

391
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
touching the bottom of the sink where

392
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
you might have some dirt from whatever

393
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,040
you've been washing before. After that,

394
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,560
you're going to move it to a cutting

395
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
board. Now, it's not just the cutting

396
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,560
board. You want to make sure the surface

397
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,320
is clean, your hands are clean, right?

398
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,959
you just touched your cell phone, went

399
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,120
to the restroom, wash it, the knife is

400
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,120
clean, and then after you chop it for

401
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,279
your salad, and let's say you're eating

402
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,880
it later, you need to chill it in the

403
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,160
refrigerator and then serve it.

404
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
So, finally, I'm going to give it an

405
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,440
idea on this, and I think everyone

406
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,360
should be listening carefully, too. 90%

407
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,839
of us, 90% of all the people who hear my

408
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,880
voice don't eat enough fruits and

409
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:38,480
vegetables, right? So, you can't be

410
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,680
afraid of salad because it just takes us

411
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,199
down the wrong path. In fact, I think

412
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,399
not eating lettuce can be a bigger

413
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,920
health problem than the occasional

414
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,920
outbreak. Although I don't want to have

415
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,399
a problem with either. So when you see a

416
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,320
scary headline, why not breed of lettuce

417
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,680
and switch to another kind for a few

418
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
weeks. That's what it takes to clean it

419
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
out of the system. When we do that, at

420
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,240
least we'll keep eating our greens,

421
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,600
making sure our families are healthy and

422
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,519
give the industry a chance to catch up

423
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,199
to whatever problem afflicted that that

424
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,480
breed of lettuce. I want to applaud all

425
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,639
of you for being here. I know it takes a

426
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,480
big uh amount of trust to come on our

427
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,480
set. You came on television, you faced

428
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,079
these questions. Thank you very much. A

429
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,839
healthy dialogue between consumers and

430
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,519
the food industry is the only way to

431
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,880
ensure healthy and safe food. So, we'll

432
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,880
keep doing it for you. We'll be right

433
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,160
back. Are you taking your probiotic all

434
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,839
wrong? We're revealing the biggest

435
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,440
mistakes you may be making and if all

436
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,600
this good stuff that could actually

437
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,560
causing your bloat and brain fog, it's

438
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,560
all coming up. That's next.

439
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,279
Bloat and brain fog, the two things you

440
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,440
dread the most. There's hammering on

441
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,760
you. Now, new headlines raised the

442
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,160
question. Could probiotics actually be

443
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,000
the blame, right? Is this a tough one

444
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,079
for me? Because, well, my favorite

445
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,240
probiotic of all is that it's Greek

446
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,920
yogurt and I have it every day. Now, I

447
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,440
know you take your probiotics a number

448
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,920
of ways throughout your day. Some of you

449
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,639
take pills and or yogurt, kefir,

450
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,279
smoothie, kombucha, right? Is it adding

451
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,800
up to be too much of a good thing?

452
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,639
That's why a new report raising

453
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,600
questions over whether probiotics may be

454
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,079
doing more harm than good caught my

455
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,480
attention. Can you overdose on

456
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:20,639
probiotics? Take a

457
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,199
look. We are in the midst of a probiotic

458
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,959
craze with consumers everywhere turning

459
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,720
to them to solve their digestion

460
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,279
dilemmas.

461
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,040
When we started this show a decade ago,

462
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,000
one of the most popular probiotic

463
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,560
sources, Greek yogurt, had only 1% of

464
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,320
the market. But now, it has skyrocketed

465
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,959
to 52% of all yogurt sales. And that's a

466
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,560
good thing. But could we be overdoing

467
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,720
it? Recent findings suggest we might be.

468
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,959
The study out of Augusta University in

469
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Georgia found that some adults taking

470
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,279
probiotic supplements and eating

471
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,000
probiotic rich foods were experiencing

472
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,880
negative side effects, feelings of

473
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,680
confusion and difficulty concentrating

474
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,439
and issues with gas and bloating. Some

475
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,760
reported that their episodes of brain

476
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,640
fog were so bad that they had to call

477
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,039
out sick from work. Today, we're busting

478
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,799
open the lid and revealing what this

479
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,799
news means for you.

480
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,640
So, I've assembled a probiotic power

481
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,039
team to help us break this down. Max

482
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,439
Luger wrote the book on the brain gut

483
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,839
connection. He's here in our gut lab

484
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,080
with women who suffer from bloat and

485
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,400
brain fog. They've agreed to stop their

486
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,320
probiotic intake for a week as a social

487
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
experiment. In just a few minutes, Max

488
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,480
will reveal if it made a difference. And

489
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,480
Dr. Raj is here to help us take a deep

490
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,600
dive into this new study. She's a gut

491
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,039
health expert and author of What the

492
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,640
Yuck? Nice picture, by the way. So, you

493
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,080
looked at the study. Is this hype or do

494
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,840
we need to be worried about this stuff?

495
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,880
Well, this is a very remarkable study

496
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,640
because we've been talking about

497
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,400
probiotics for years now and how great

498
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,640
they are, but this raises the question,

499
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,799
can you get too much of a good thing?

500
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,120
So, this study looked at 30 people who

501
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,200
had brain fog and then eight people who

502
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,679
did not. They all had abdominal pain,

503
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,559
bloating, distension, gas, and they

504
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,320
actually told them to stop taking

505
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,840
probiotics and see what happens. Many of

506
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,840
them actually felt better. So the

507
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,080
question is were the probiotics causing

508
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,679
the problem? However, I have to say I

509
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,760
have some issues with this study. It was

510
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,200
a very small sample size. There were a

511
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,720
lot of other factors involved. Many of

512
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,799
these people actually took antibiotics

513
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,559
as well. So that what actually made them

514
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,240
feel better. We're not sure, but it

515
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,440
certainly raises a lot of questions and

516
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,520
patients are going to definitely start

517
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,919
asking me about it also. So I got

518
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,360
curious about this because I wanted to

519
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,720
understand what the thought process was.

520
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,960
Let me explain it all to you. So we set

521
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,919
up some surveillance cameras inside the

522
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,200
gut. Right. inside the gut to show you

523
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,039
what's supposed to happen when you take

524
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,480
a probiotic. Now, normally you take the

525
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,679
probiotic up in your mouth, right? It

526
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
comes down through the swallowing tube,

527
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,400
the esophagus, into the stomach, right?

528
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,400
And it's supposed to pass right through

529
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,240
your small intestine and set up shop in

530
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,480
your colon, right? Where they work

531
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,400
really hard, right, to digest your food.

532
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,559
Now, according to researchers, in some

533
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,799
people, those bacteria don't make it to

534
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,720
your colon. Instead, they get stuck way

535
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,480
up high in the small intestine, right?

536
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,600
And they camp out there, right? But they

537
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,200
still want to eat what we're eating,

538
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,799
which is a problem because they're doing

539
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,240
way ahead of when they're supposed to.

540
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,080
And they eat more than they could ever

541
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,880
get to in your colon, which leads them

542
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,039
to create basically a waste environment

543
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,640
that ferments and builds up with gas and

544
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:25,039
a substance called o dlactic acid and

545
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,080
that's putting a target for bloat on

546
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,440
your belly. Right. That's the theory. So

547
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,240
Dr. Raj, what happens when there's a

548
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,679
buildup of gas and dlactic acid in your

549
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,440
small intestine? We'll pretend this is a

550
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,960
small intestine. Exactly. So imagine

551
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,039
this is your small intestine. Your small

552
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,120
intestine is not used to having a lot of

553
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,039
gas in it. It feels very uncomfortable.

554
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,559
That bacteria is being fermented. It's

555
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,400
actually going to produce gas. You feel

556
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,679
like you can't button those pants. That

557
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,360
awful feeling like you're absolutely

558
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,520
going to pop. Some people hate that

559
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,280
sound.

560
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,799
Uh but yeah, I mean it can be very

561
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
uncomfortable. So here's the big

562
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,880
question, right? Do probiotics seem to

563
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,320
actually cause bloat in brain frog? If

564
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,320
they do, why does it happen in

565
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,160
everybody? Why do some people take

566
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,160
probiotics to get better from bloat and

567
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,840
brain fog and others get worse with it?

568
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,600
Well, we are all different. Our bodies

569
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,679
are all different, including our guts.

570
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,440
Not everyone reacts the same to a

571
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,039
certain probiotic. If you're not feeling

572
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,720
great on this one, let's take a break

573
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,080
and try a different one. Dr. Rush, thank

574
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,320
you very much. Okay, now we understand

575
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,320
how probiotics can cause some bloat in

576
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,320
folks, but what about the brain and gut

577
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,840
connection? So, let's talk to Max about

578
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,600
this. Some of you studied quite a bit.

579
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,600
You asked viewers suffering from bloat

580
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,280
but also this this brain gut connection

581
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,559
to go on a probiotic elimination diet

582
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,000
it would be hard I think for a lot of us

583
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,679
to do that right but you wanted to see

584
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,840
if their symptoms would be reversed

585
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,200
right were you happy with it yeah I mean

586
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,640
I think that the results that you're

587
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,559
going to find are very interesting to

588
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
say the least but you know Dr. Oz,

589
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,200
what's so fascinating is that the gut

590
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,720
influences the brain in such a an

591
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,400
interesting number of ways. In fact, the

592
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,080
gut is often referred to as the second

593
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
brain. Let's see what actually happens

594
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,000
in practice. So, we got each member of

595
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,840
our social experiment standing behind

596
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,679
their traditional source of probiotics.

597
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,080
Thank you all for being here. Thank you.

598
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,679
So, I guess we'll start with you. I

599
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,600
really impressed. I even saw across the

600
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,200
studio how much of variety you have. I

601
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,640
love you have sauerkraut in there, not

602
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,720
just Greek yogurt. You got a lot of

603
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,480
sources. That's good. Was it What was

604
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,559
hard to give up? Was it more difficult

605
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,720
than you thought? Yeah, it was actually

606
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,120
difficult to give it up, but it actually

607
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,440
helped me though because I actually was

608
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,280
less bloated and I had less foggess. And

609
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,600
Ariana, you also have a couple different

610
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,000
sources. How was it for you? I was

611
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,360
actually the opposite of her. Like I

612
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,360
missed this. This was like the hardest

613
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,679
thing I've had to do because like I got

614
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,520
all the symptoms back. So like that's

615
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,200
not a good thing. So I got a little

616
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,799
surprise for everybody. I actually took

617
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,400
the probiotic elimination challenge

618
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,120
myself. I was curious cuz I ate lots of

619
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,280
probiotics and it's u it's not that easy

620
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,400
for a Turkish kid to give up Greek

621
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:57,320
yogurt. Take a

622
00:21:51,400 --> 00:22:01,360
[Music]

623
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,360
look. I'm going to miss you, my

624
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:12,640
[Music]

625
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,520
friend. So, it's the afternoon. Usually

626
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,559
I have lots of energy, but I can really

627
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,200
tell the difference. I didn't have

628
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,240
yogurt this morning. It's like all the

629
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:25,400
little embers in my body have gone out.

630
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,400
[Music]

631
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,799
It's worth it.

632
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:35,600
[Music]

633
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,440
I failed. It was a massive fail.

634
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
Actually, Dr. Raj, you say maybe it's a

635
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,120
good thing that I failed that I kept

636
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,640
eating my probiotics. I do. And I don't

637
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,240
want people out there to run to their

638
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,679
fridges and throw out their Greek

639
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,600
yogurt. That's not what we're saying

640
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,840
here. Actually, if you were feeling well

641
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,440
on your probiotic regimen, then we say

642
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,679
if it ain't broke, don't fix it. You

643
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,960
keep doing what you were doing. And most

644
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,880
people out there will benefit from

645
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,159
probiotics. Yeah, everybody. Everyone

646
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,840
out there, most of you are probably like

647
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,120
me. We can still eat our Greek yogurt

648
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,520
and all the other probiotics we're

649
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,039
talking about. God bless you. Max, for

650
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,480
the f folks out there, and I don't think

651
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,240
there many, but there probably some who

652
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,480
should think about elimination. How do

653
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,520
you identify them? As a first line of

654
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
defense, I would say removing the

655
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,200
probiotics is worth a shot. You know, if

656
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,720
your probiotics are not working for you,

657
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,159
then try eliminating them from your

658
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,080
diet. It's a very simple elimination

659
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,600
style approach. One week. One week. Try

660
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,640
it for a week. Try it for a week. And if

661
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,159
your symptoms don't clear up and

662
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,440
resolve, go see your doctor. All right.

663
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
When we come back, are you taking

664
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,640
probiotics all wrong? There's a whole

665
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,080
different issue. Are you taking them

666
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,520
with the wrong stuff? And what's the

667
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,840
right amount for you? We'll tell you

668
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,840
after the break.

669
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,799
An all new Alzheimer's alert. The latest

670
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,799
Alzheimer's breakthroughs that you've

671
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,520
been seeing in the headlines. Could your

672
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,280
body type determine your risk? It's

673
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,510
going to surprise you which one. All new

674
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,910
Oz. That's coming up on

675
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,400
[Music]

676
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:59,679
[Applause]

677
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,320
Wednesday. We're back asking, are you

678
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,240
taking probiotics all wrong? My experts

679
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,159
Dr. Raj and Max Lug are here with

680
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,000
probiotic mistakes you could be making.

681
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,360
These are going to surprise you. The

682
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,799
first probiotic mistake you may be

683
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,039
making is you're getting your probiotics

684
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,799
from only one source. Why is that a

685
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,360
problem, Max? Well, Dr. Oz, you see,

686
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,000
your gut, like any healthy society,

687
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,720
benefits from a broad range of voices.

688
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Diversity is key, right? So, the same

689
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,840
thing goes for probiotic bacteria. If

690
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,919
you're getting your probiotic bacteria

691
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,080
from only one source, that's not going

692
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,880
to lead to the best scenario in the gut.

693
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
You want to make sure that you're

694
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,760
getting your probiotics from a broad

695
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,559
array of sources. So, here we have

696
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,640
kombucha, we have Greek yogurt, we have

697
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,000
a probiotic containing supplement. All

698
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,360
right. Next probiotic mistake that many

699
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,720
of you guys are making is you're not

700
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,400
pairing your prebiotics and your

701
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,520
probiotics. So, probiotics, you know

702
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,039
what those are, right? Those little

703
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,880
bacteria that are in your gut.

704
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,799
Prebiotics, what are they and why they

705
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,640
so critical, right? So, prebiotic is

706
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,799
anything that promotes the growth of

707
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,480
probiotics. So, of course, why wouldn't

708
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,240
you want to enhance those probiotics

709
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,640
that you're already taking by pairing it

710
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,159
with a prebiotic? It's a power duo. You

711
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,000
can get prebiotics from anything that

712
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,720
really contains fiber. Blueberries,

713
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,480
which I know you love, bananas, and

714
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,880
really, you want to get those both into

715
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,640
your diet every day. Pro and pre. Max

716
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,520
calls these brainberries. Am I right?

717
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,120
You know, you know I love my

718
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,440
blueberries. He does. Here, have another

719
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
one. It's a present from the show. Next

720
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,760
probiotic mistake that a lot of you guys

721
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,159
are making is you're taking your

722
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,679
probiotic with heartburn medicine. Let

723
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,520
me take a step here. Heartburn medicine.

724
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,120
I get why so many folks take it, but it

725
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,240
does cause a lot of interactions and

726
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,320
it's particularly a problem with pre

727
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,000
with probiotics, right? So, there is a

728
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,240
concern that if you're reducing the

729
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,679
acid, which is what these medicines do,

730
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,600
you're going to have an overgrowth of

731
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,559
bacteria in your small intestine. Now,

732
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,240
does that mean when you take a

733
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,640
probiotic, you're even adding to that

734
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,840
problem? Maybe for some people, I would

735
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
say if you're already taking your

736
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,840
antacids and your probiotics and you

737
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,120
feel fine, keep doing what you're doing.

738
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,799
All right. And the final one's going to

739
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,919
really surprise you. There's a big

740
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,000
mistake that a lot of us are making

741
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,440
because done right, it's not a mistake.

742
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,279
Done wrong, it's a big problem is you're

743
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,880
taking your probiotic with hot coffee or

744
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,840
tea. Now, Max, hot coffee and tea

745
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,840
generally, I thought were good for the

746
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,360
gut. Yeah. So, absolutely independently,

747
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,360
coffee and tea are very good for the

748
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,559
gut. Most people are conf are uh

749
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,480
surprised to hear that coffee is

750
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,760
actually beneficial, but um I've looked

751
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,279
into the research, you know, and I'm a

752
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm definitely a fan of coffee. The

753
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,840
issue is that these scalding beverages

754
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,679
can the same way they can burn our skin

755
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,440
can also burn these delicate probiotic

756
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,600
bacteria that we want. So my

757
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,600
recommendation is to separate your

758
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,440
consumption of hot beverages and and

759
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,240
when you take your probiotics by a half

760
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,480
an hour. I'll toast to that. Hey Raj,

761
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,840
this is to you. Thank you so much.

762
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,799
Wonderful folks to have on the show. Max

763
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,799
and Dr. Raj. We'll be right back.

764
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,279
Is there hidden dairy in your nutmilk?

765
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,320
We did the testing. Find out what our

766
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,320
investigation uncovered next.

767
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,360
[Music]

768
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,600
An urgent recall is sounding the alarm

769
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,440
for nut milk lovers nationwide. The

770
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,080
number one selling brand of almond milk

771
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,279
reported traces of cow's milk in their

772
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,120
product and pulled them from the

773
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,200
shelves. What does this mean for you?

774
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,000
Today we investigate. Is there hidden

775
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,000
dairy in your almond milk? Joining me is

776
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,640
investigative reporter Marsh Gavakampo

777
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,240
who looked into this and g give us the

778
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,880
headlines if you don't mind. What was

779
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,480
the big manufacturer of almond milk who

780
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
decided to voluntarily withdraw their

781
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,919
product? Yeah, the company is Blue

782
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,919
Diamond and it's their vanilla almond

783
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,520
breeze. Now, Blue Diamond is the top

784
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,840
seller of almond milk in the country.

785
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,520
It's the most popular by far. They

786
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,080
issued this recall because of the

787
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,240
possible presence of dairy in the almond

788
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,240
milk. Now, that may sound like a small

789
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,640
thing, but if you have a dairy allergy,

790
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,360
it can be very dangerous. In fact, the

791
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,240
company itself said that this possible

792
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,919
contamination had the risk of serious or

793
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,440
lifethreatening allergic reactions for

794
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,520
people who have dairy allergies. And let

795
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,480
me speak to this Blue Diamond did they

796
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,840
did the right thing, right? They

797
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
rectified the situation as soon as they

798
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,120
found out about it. And I want to

799
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,039
commend you all for doing that. But I

800
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,679
want to get back to this almond milk.

801
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:59,520
Companies do the right thing. So how

802
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,120
much was contaminated? Do we have any

803
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,279
idea of what kind of risks it could it

804
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,559
could offer? Yeah, it was a very wide

805
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,799
reach. There were

806
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,559
145,000 more than 145,000 cartons

807
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,320
recalled. These were half gallon

808
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,480
cartons. And you can see it was shipped

809
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,720
to 28 states. That's more than half the

810
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,000
country. So, it's a very wide reach. So,

811
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,520
let's look into what the real issues

812
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,760
were because I want to look at who buys

813
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,679
almond milk and which of these issues

814
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,840
are affecting our viewers. So, we asked

815
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,760
our viewers why they like almond milk.

816
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,440
This is from our folks just like you,

817
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,760
right? Here are the responses. I prefer

818
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,840
the taste. I'm on a paleo diet. It's

819
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,000
lower in calories, dairy sensitive, and

820
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,760
allergic, right? It's these two groups

821
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,120
at the bottom that are most concerning

822
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,720
to me. That's what gets me nervous

823
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,480
because these issues can be

824
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,520
life-threatening. They'll make you sick,

825
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,960
especially if you've got dairy

826
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,880
allergies. Take it just a tiny little

827
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,480
bit as you were mentioning, Mara, can be

828
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,120
a main problem. And some folks really

829
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,880
rely on this nut milk. So, trust is an

830
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,720
important issue. Did anyone get sick

831
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,640
from half the country basically being

832
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,240
exposed to this this almond milk

833
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,080
contamination? Yeah, the company said

834
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,320
they received reports of one person

835
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,760
getting sick and luckily it was not very

836
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,360
serious. That person did not require

837
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,440
medical attention or hospitalization,

838
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,520
but again, as you noted, th those dairy

839
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,559
allergies can be very serious. So, let

840
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,159
me ask a question. I'm sure everyone's

841
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,080
thinking, how does it happen? I mean,

842
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,159
you don't you don't milk an almond tree,

843
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,000
right? So, how did how did the almond

844
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,679
milk get mixed with the dairy milk? How

845
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,919
did this happen? You know, we don't

846
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,399
exactly know for sure. Here's what we do

847
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,960
know. Hood is Blue Diamond's parent

848
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,480
company. They're a major dairy producer

849
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,039
and it's been reported that they were

850
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,120
manufacturing dairy, cow's milk and the

851
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,480
almond milk at the same facility. The

852
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,640
only thing the company will tell us is

853
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,919
that it was caused by human error.

854
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,679
That's what we know. We don't have the

855
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,520
specific details of what that human

856
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,600
error was. Well, you we've all seen

857
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,360
labels on food products where

858
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,960
crosscontamination could be a risk,

859
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,240
especially if there's an allergy that

860
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,919
could cause a big problem. You've all

861
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,840
seen this, right? say it'll say may

862
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,760
contain traces of milk or this is pretty

863
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,399
common made in a facility that also

864
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,120
processes tree nuts. Now, did Blue

865
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,120
Diamond have a little warning label like

866
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,720
this at potential contamination? We went

867
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,880
out and we checked the Blue Diamond

868
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,720
almond milk did not contain a warning

869
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,200
label warning of potential traces of

870
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,880
milk. And on the flip side, Hood's milk

871
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,480
that is possibly manufactured at the

872
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,080
same facility as the almond milk didn't

873
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,559
contain a warning label about the

874
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,559
possible presence of tree nuts. So if if

875
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,919
dairy and nuts are being first of all

876
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,200
they're pretty common period right

877
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,799
they're produced in a lot of places and

878
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,480
they can cause bad allergies that folks

879
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,559
might need to know about. So is there a

880
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,080
warning required by facilities by the US

881
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,760
government or anybody else? You know we

882
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,440
reached out to the FDA and we spoke to

883
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,440
them about this exact issue. Here's what

884
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,279
they told us. They recommend that

885
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,559
companies include these allergen labels

886
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,240
when products like this are being

887
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,240
manufactured in the same facility, but

888
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,440
it's not a requirement. What they did

889
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,520
tell us though is that it's the

890
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,520
company's responsibility to make sure

891
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,640
there's no crosscontamination. So we

892
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
reached out to Blue Diamond for a

893
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,880
statement and they referred us to their

894
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,120
press release which we're going to post

895
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,399
on dr.com so you can find out much more

896
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,080
about the recall. The next thing I

897
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,559
wanted to do was figure out is there

898
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,640
hidden dairy in other nutils or is this

899
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,320
just an isolated incident? So Mara and

900
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,840
the medical unit got together right we

901
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,520
collected samples from the top five

902
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,279
leading brands of almond milk. There

903
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,399
they are right pretty fairly got them

904
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,159
all and we sent them off to an

905
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,000
independent lab where they were tested

906
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,840
for any traces of hidden dairy. We just

907
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,200
wanted to understand whether this is a

908
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,360
possibility that could be affecting more

909
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,640
of you. So Mara, ready for the results?

910
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,640
Yeah, absolutely. Take it away. All

911
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,720
right. So of the five brands that we

912
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,840
tested, we found the presence of dairy

913
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,760
in none of them. In none. None. That's

914
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,159
good. So right now people can breathe

915
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,760
easy. That's fantastic. Yeah, it's very

916
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,679
good news because this concerned a lot

917
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,039
of people who are trying to avoid dairy.

918
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,720
I'm happy. It's very reassuring. And I

919
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,799
want to point out that Blue Diamond was

920
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,399
actually in this as well. So they seem

921
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,720
to have fixed their issue. Kudos to

922
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,760
everybody all going around. Up next, why

923
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,200
the FDA is going to war with non-dairy

924
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,880
milks. It's a heated debate you won't

925
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,039
want to miss. But first, if you want the

926
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,880
safest and healthiest all milk, the best

927
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,640
thing you do is make it yourself. We

928
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,170
have a video showing you how. And it's

929
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:04,039
easier than you

[Music]

935
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,440
You got milk? Well, if you're an almond

936
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,360
milk lover like that little girl we just

937
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,919
saw, the answer isn't so simple anymore.

938
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,440
The FDA has soured their stance at how

939
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,600
non-dairy milk should be labeled, and

940
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,679
it's being called an allout war. The

941
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,799
dairy industry is pushing to remove the

942
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,039
word milk from popular non-dairy

943
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,399
alternatives like almond, soy, and

944
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,799
coconut, claiming they're not really

945
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,480
actually milk, but nut milk makers say

946
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,880
consumers are going to be confused. So,

947
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,480
how much does one word really matter?

948
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,159
I've got two containers here. All right.

949
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,360
One is almond milk, the other one is

950
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,640
almond beverage, right? So, quick quiz,

951
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,200
audience member, I want someone to be

952
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,279
honest here. Are you an honest person? I

953
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,320
I think so. You look honest. All right.

954
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,720
What What do you think about these?

955
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,000
Would this be at all confusing for you?

956
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,519
A little bit. Because when I see

957
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,200
beverage, I think of sugar or maybe

958
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:41,279
processed versus milk. I mean, I know

959
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,200
it's non-dairy, but it's more familiar,

960
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,039
I guess. Is that your mom? That is my

961
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,519
mom. Let's see what a word of wisdom.

962
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,360
What do you think? I like almond milk,

963
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,399
and the wording wouldn't make any

964
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,679
difference for me. So, if I just showed

965
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,840
you almond beverage, you'd be okay with

966
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,320
it? Yeah. Wouldn't confuse at all? Nope.

967
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,600
All right. So, it's a mix. We'll see.

968
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,399
How many of you might think almond

969
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,399
beverage isn't the same as almond milk?

970
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,080
Yeah, I mean it's most of the audience.

971
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,840
Okay, here. It's no gift for you guys.

972
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,360
Enjoy it. All right, so to be clear,

973
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,800
these are the exact same products. The

974
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,760
only thing has changed is that almond

975
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,679
milk has been rebranded almond beverage.

976
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,760
But I wanted to hear both sides on this

977
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,599
debate. So we set it up with Dr. Joel

978
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,679
Khan, author of the plant-based

979
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,240
solution, who's here to argue that nut

980
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,320
milks should just be labeled milk. And

981
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,839
then we've got nutritionist and New York

982
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,599
Times bestselling author of the 10day

983
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,359
belly slim down Kellyanne Patricia who

984
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,679
says they should not. Right. Dairy milk

985
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,159
is the only true milk. So Dr. Khan, you

986
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,000
get to go first. Don't you don't take it

987
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,800
easy on her. She'll come after you. You

988
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,679
got 45 seconds to defend your beliefs.

989
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,520
Convince us that milk from a not should

990
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,440
be labeled as milk and not something

991
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,599
different. Got it. Thank you. Thank you,

992
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,280
Dr. Oz. Simply put, it is just silly to

993
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,839
think that milk has to be a cow

994
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,079
secretion. I call it utter nonsense. And

995
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,079
actually, when the FDA director a few

996
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,240
weeks ago pointed out that almonds don't

997
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,240
lactate, he was really buckling under

998
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,320
pressure of a shrinking dairy industry

999
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,760
that's still 20 times larger than the

1000
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,920
plant-based industry. They're crying

1001
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,440
over spilled milk overall. But this does

1002
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,200
actually make a difference because

1003
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,280
there's health consequences. The number

1004
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,920
one food allergy in infants and children

1005
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,400
is dairy. 90% of people in some

1006
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,480
populations can't digest milk sugar and

1007
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,560
feel bad. And finally, in my field,

1008
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,760
people are flying away from milk because

1009
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,320
they're trying to reduce the risk of

1010
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,400
heart disease. It is a very broad term,

1011
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,720
the word milk. We don't need new terms

1012
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,560
to confuse the public. The bottom line,

1013
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,320
call it milk, whether from plant or

1014
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,480
animal, and just let the food industry

1015
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,320
have a cow over it. All right, that was

1016
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,480
pretty good. That's 45 and a half

1017
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,680
seconds. Thank you, Dr. Kelly. Makes

1018
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,440
some good points. Kelly, I'm going turn

1019
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,480
it to you. 45 seconds. defend your

1020
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,160
argument that there's a difference.

1021
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah. So, Dr. Khan, you made some good

1022
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,000
points, but you seem to be having a cow

1023
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,640
over this. So, let's help straighten

1024
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,160
this out. Boom. Here's the problem. The

1025
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,599
problem is that a lot of these

1026
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,599
companies, these companies that are

1027
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,320
producing these alternative milks,

1028
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,040
they're placing them on the shelves next

1029
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,520
to regular milk. Can you see how this

1030
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,160
can be confusing to the public? Because

1031
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,240
here's why. The nutrient density of the

1032
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,720
two products are drastically different.

1033
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,720
They shouldn't be compared at all. So

1034
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,440
really, it's telling the consumer

1035
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,119
something that's not true. And if you

1036
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,160
really dig in deep, say if you look at

1037
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,480
almond milk, it's only 2% almond and the

1038
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,760
rest actually is all water. So what

1039
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,680
you're actually getting is almond water.

1040
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,440
So can you understand how this is really

1041
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,079
disheartening to all those hardworking

1042
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,440
dairy farmers out there? Not good. I

1043
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,680
mean, it's not the same product. That's

1044
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,000
all. It's like calling a potato chip a

1045
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,440
pork chop. All right, Dr. Con, she threw

1046
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,599
one last little jab at you. So, you get

1047
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,440
to defend yourself. Make it short.

1048
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,040
Wounded and bleeding. But I'd say again,

1049
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,720
there's many health benefits of

1050
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,320
plant-based milks. And what the consumer

1051
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,800
doesn't need is new terms they don't

1052
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,440
get, like nut juice. Call it milk. Plant

1053
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,800
or animal. One term for all. All right,

1054
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,079
audience. Let me just pull you guys real

1055
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,839
quickly. Who out there thinks they ought

1056
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,560
to both be called milk? Put your hands

1057
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,000
up. And And who thinks they should all

1058
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,240
be different? Beverage for nuts and milk

1059
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,240
should be called from dairy cows milk.

1060
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,160
So, it's like the US population is split

1061
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,160
5052. I didn't say anything else either.

1062
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,440
No, it's okay. I I like it. It's a

1063
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,280
debate. It's how it's going to be

1064
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,200
settled. You You guys make some noise

1065
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,839
out there. We want to hear from you. So,

1066
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,480
you can vote at dr.com. Should almond

1067
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:32,320
milk be considered milk? Here are the

1068
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:34,079
results so far. 71% yes. 29% say no. Oh

1069
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,560
my goodness. All right, you guys vote.

1070
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,560
We'll be right back.

1071
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,720
He would say, "Shut up or I'll kill

1072
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,040
you." All new Oz. True Crime Tuesday is

1073
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,599
back. How new DNA science helped crack

1074
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,480
the case of the Golden State Killer.

1075
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,880
This guy is the devil on Earth. That's

1076
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,880
coming up tomorrow.

1077
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,880
Dr. Oz, I know you're trying to catch up

1078
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,839
with me. Okay, so you hit the 10 mark. I

1079
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,359
think that's pretty good. 10 mark. Um,

1080
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,760
we did that around 1996. So, you got a

1081
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,000
ways to go, but you're really, really

1082
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,640
going strong. I'm proud of the work that

1083
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,440
you do, not just on the show, but your

1084
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,760
dedication to making a sense of wellness

1085
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,079
and well-being for everybody in the

1086
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,800
country and throughout the world. Uh,

1087
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,680
I'm proud of you, the courage it takes

1088
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,760
to get up every day and to say what you

1089
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,240
say and do what you do. All I got to say

1090
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,200
is keep doing it cuz you got 15 more

1091
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,200
years to catch up.

1092
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,359
Oh my goodness. You know, I I wasn't

1093
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,560
allowed I wasn't allowed to see any of

1094
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,480
these videos, so they know I get

1095
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,000
emotional, but I want to thank Oprah.

1096
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,760
Your mentorship means the world to me.

1097
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,280
I'm very grateful for this platform to

1098
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,280
inspire people all over the world, to

1099
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,160
take folks on a on a health journey they

1100
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,599
wouldn't have been able to go on and

1101
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,119
take their health into their own hands.

1102
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,599
It wouldn't happen without you. So,

1103
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,359
bless you. Over the past 10 years, I've

1104
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,480
seen all of your healths transform

1105
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,240
before my eyes. You've seen it

1106
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,440
yourselves. And I'm going to keep moving

1107
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,040
forward. I want you to keep coming with

1108
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,720
me because together we're going to make

1109
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,560
the next 10 years ahead of us the

1110
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,359
happiest and healthiest of our lives.

1111
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,000
Does that sound good? I know we can do

1112
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,000
it. We're just getting started. So, I

1113
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,160
asked some celebrity friends of the show

1114
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,839
to share with us what they want their

1115
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,839
next 10 to be like. Take a

1116
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,079
look. In the next 10

1117
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,079
years, I hope I'll still be doing what I

1118
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:36,720
love, directing, writing, and recording.

1119
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:40,880
I feel very fortunate to have music as a

1120
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,599
creative way to express my feelings. I

1121
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,920
see myself in the next 10 years super

1122
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,000
happy, super healthy, and changing the

1123
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,520
world. Maybe saving a puppy or uh you

1124
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,520
know, stopping human trafficking, but no

1125
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,040
matter what, inspiring the world and

1126
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,359
giving back to the world all the great

1127
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,320
things it gave to me. Seriously, 10

1128
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,400
years that would make me

1129
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,720
96 just to be here. I just hope to be

1130
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,640
here to do everything that makes me

1131
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,040
happy. I'm going to look very carefully

1132
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,400
in the mirror and see what aging has

1133
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,880
done to me. And I'm going to do

1134
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,480
everything in my effort, massage and

1135
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,640
exercise and good food and non-smoking

1136
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,880
and non-drinking. I'm going to try and

1137
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,400
make myself look as good as possible.

1138
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,560
Really doing things that impact the

1139
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,000
world. You know, I don't want to just,

1140
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,599
you know, be in front of the camera and

1141
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,040
be behind the camera for self- serving

1142
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,480
purposes. I really want to do things

1143
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,960
that impact society. Dr. Oz, I just want

1144
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,119
to say that for the next 10 years, I

1145
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,560
hope I continue to age backwards like

1146
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,280
you

1147
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,720
[Music]

1148
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,160
are. I love what they're saying and I

1149
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,160
love that all of you are sharing your

1150
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,800
next 10 goals with me on social media

1151
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,200
using the hashtag my next10. I've seen

1152
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,960
some of you pledge all kinds of things

1153
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,119
from adding an evening walk to your

1154
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,200
routine to making plans to see that

1155
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,119
friend you follow on Facebook but you

1156
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,440
lost touch with in real life. And a lot

1157
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,440
of you plan on crossing that dream trip

1158
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,280
off your bucket list to the next 10.

1159
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,599
I'll be following all your posts with my

1160
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,440
next 10 hashtag and responding myself

1161
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,440
with some little notes of encouragement.

1162
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,359
I'll send messages to you as well. But

1163
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,040
when it comes to goals, there's nothing

1164
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,680
like a little motivation, is there?

1165
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,000
Something to sort of nudge you

1166
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,160
along. So, how about this? All year

1167
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,640
long, we will be surprising a few

1168
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,280
creative and lucky viewers with the best

1169
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,480
posts and best ideas. And we're giving

1170
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,240
you all some gifts and some surprises,

1171
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,000
including trips to Iceland. That's

1172
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,599
right. I took my son there. One of the

1173
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,599
best trips of my life. And you get to do

1174
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,040
it now. Our friends at Wow Airlines, the

1175
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,040

1182
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,960
Pinterest to get some of that thermal

1183
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,280
healing. It's worth it. And I always I

1184
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,440
want you guys to get more sleep. Keep

1185
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,880
saying that. So Rison Hotels will

1192
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,200
Now everybody remember it's just the

1193
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,480
beginning. We're going to keep doing

1194
