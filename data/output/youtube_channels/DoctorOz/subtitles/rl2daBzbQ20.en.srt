Craving carbs? Counting calories? We're

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,080
slicing up the truth behind thin versus

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,240
light bread. How do you make something

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,880
light by adding sugar? And Oz

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,400
investigates frozen fries. There are

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
still a lot of questions about what's in

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
this bag and exactly how they're made.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,119
Plus, need a little coffee with your

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,960
creamer? A lot of these creamers had

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,039
about 10 different ingredients, and

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,270
guess what? They weren't milk and cream.

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,920
Coming up next.

[Applause]

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,480
We're about to conquer one of the most

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,000
feared areas of the supermarket. That's

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,079
why you're excited. I know it. We're

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
talking about the bread aisle. It's been

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,400
so much time, you love it. With so much

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,479
fear of carbs and calories, though,

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,840
other alternatives have been popping up,

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,240
such as light or thin bread. You've

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,920
heard those terms. Yeah, we all have.

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,560
With about half the calories, you think

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,479
you can have two slices instead of one.

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
But what's really in them? Are they

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
better than other loaves? One of my

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,920
viewers is a fan of these breads

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,240
already. So, Kelly, why did you make the

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,880
switch to these light and thin breads?

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,040
So, who doesn't love bread? We all love

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,920
bread, Dr. Oz, but we just don't want to

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,759
have so many carbs. So, that's why when

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
I heard about light bread, I knew it was

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,119
a great alternative. And it comes in

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,680
many different forms. There's wheat

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,240
bread, there's English muffins, even

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,399
some flatbread. So, there's a multitude

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
of options for you and it's also still

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,119
healthy. So, just because this this is

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,720
just a regular bread that's been

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,560
flattened or just called or just called

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,399
flatbread. I guess it's just called

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,119
flatbread, but it definitely feels like

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399
you're eating less and um low carb, low

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,079
calorie. And which ones do you

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,759
personally like the most? I like English

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,439
muffins. I think it's really nice to

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,600
have with egg and cheese in the morning

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,960
and a little bite-siz sandwich. The

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,000
smile on your face says it all. You guys

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
love these things. But here to

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
investigate the breads because we have

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,000
to do a little bit of this is a

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
journalist who I trust on these issues

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,040
who's uncovered how food companies can

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,760
hook us. Michael Moss along with

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,160
rockstar baker Zachary Gulper from

64
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
Benqui Bakery. Very well. Did I say it

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,120
correctly? Benqui. That's it. Yeah.

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,800
Thank you. But he's very French. All

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
right. So, some people have come to fear

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
bread. You know, there are some of our

69
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
audience members who've gotten

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,840
comfortable with these newer versions,

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
but bread itself has become a problem.

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
What do you think about these

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,879
supermarket breads? Yeah, it's so

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,879
interesting. I mean, you walk in the

75
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,879
door of the supermarket and there's so

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,519
much that can terrify you, right? The

77
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,640
soda aisle, the the chips, the frozen

78
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
foods. I mean, you and I have talked

79
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,840
about a lot of these minefields that I

80
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,720
always saw the bread aisle as this safe

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,640
haven of innocence, right? But it's not.

82
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,200
Bread is a product made by some of these

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,640
same big companies. And we need to think

84
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
about it. All right. Since the beginning

85
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
of time, bread has been basically flour,

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,680
water, and yeast. It literally allowed

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,840
humans to live together because we can

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,440
make enough of it. Zachary, these light

89
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,040
breads look very similar to the regular

90
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,800
ones. And literally, look at this.

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,720
Regular bread, light bread. You'd have a

92
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
hard time telling them apart. I've

93
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,760
actually tasted them. You've heard from

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
our audience members as well. They're

95
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,200
similar, but they have half the

96
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,680
calories, right? A lot fewer carbs. How

97
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,319
do you actually do that? Well, the way

98
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,640
that you would make a super light bread

99
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,519
would be through using uh enriched

100
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,840
flowers, uh dough conditioners, a huge

101
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
amount of yeast, and the fermentation

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,879
time would be very very short with the

103
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,959
idea of getting a very large rise uh

104
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,959
quickly to get a lighter loaf. But some

105
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,879
of the problems fall in with uh some of

106
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,879
those dough conditioners will include uh

107
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,239
monoglycerides, which we know to contain

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,080
trans fats, and that can be a little bit

109
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,519
dangerous to your health. But um

110
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
ultimately what's happening is you're

111
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,319
creating a very similar looking loaf

112
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,480
that's a lot lighter in weight. So when

113
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,760
you slice a slice it weighs less than

114
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
that which you would find at your corner

115
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,640
bakery. And the fact that the

116
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,920
fermentation times are different just

117
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,640
it's not just a science experiment

118
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,760
observation. I understand again I'm

119
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,360
thinking about as a doctor that there

120
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,280
there could be profound effects on our

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,760
health if the natural way we have made

122
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,400
bread for thousands of years is hacked

123
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,920
by speeding up fermentation. Indeed, I

124
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,120
agree with that. And I think that when

125
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,959
it comes to people who are having

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
trouble digesting wheat, that probably

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,880
has to do with the fermentation time

128
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
because with an extended fermentation

129
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,120
time, the enzymes break down the complex

130
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,280
carbohydrates and convert it to a simple

131
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,199
sugar. Then the yeast and bacteria

132
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,759
consume it so our human body doesn't

133
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,040
have to. Let the bacteria help you.

134
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,280
They're digesting the stuff in your

135
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
belly anyway. Yatsource digestion. Let

136
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,400
it work outside the body as well. Okay,

137
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,800
let's uncover some surprising

138
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
ingredients that we have found in these

139
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
light supermarket breads. The first

140
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
surprising ingredient, don't be shocked

141
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
by this. It's sugar. Zach, I thought

142
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,360
these supposed to be light. How do you

143
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
make something light by adding sugar?

144
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
Well, I think it falls into the same

145
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,080
category of trying to get it to rise as

146
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,080
quickly as possible and get as much air

147
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,040
in there as you can. Uh, so we've got

148
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,479
corn syrup here. We've got white sugar.

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,919
We've got honey, which of course is a

150
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,520
natural sweetener. We've got molasses,

151
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,120
which is a byproduct of Look at that the

152
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,199
ingredient list actually on bread says

153
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,960
high fructose corn syrup sometimes. So

154
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,440
we actually found that over half of the

155
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
light breads half looked the ones we

156
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,840
looked at had added artificial

157
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,000
sweeteners as well as high fructose corn

158
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,680
syrup. They were top of the list. It was

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,199
already present. So Michael, this is

160
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
something you've been pretty vocal about

161
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,280
that adding sugars to these foods, all

162
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,440
foods, but but bread in particular could

163
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,440
be a gateway for a lot of people. Yeah.

164
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,199
You know, sugar addiction is usually we

165
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
think about something with like candy

166
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,680
bars or a pint of ice cream, right?

167
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,280
Because the sugar rushes to the reward

168
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,759
center of your brain which sends back

169
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,919
that feeling of pleasure which can turn

170
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,680
into cravings and get you to eat too

171
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,160
much. But the fascinating about bread is

172
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,880
that besides kind of the added sugar,

173
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,080
it's one of those things that converts

174
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,400
to sugar in your body. And there's some

175
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,440
school of thought that the more refined

176
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,840
the flour is, the whiter the flour, the

177
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,400
faster it gets converted into sugar in

178
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,560
your body. And the stronger that reward

179
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
signal and feeling of pleasure be that

180
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,440
comes out. So the danger is you may end

181
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
up overeating the bread or move on to

182
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
even more sugary products. It triggers

183
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,160
people. Yes. Like any other addiction.

184
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,840
All right. There's another category of

185
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,680
lower calorie breads we've been hearing

186
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,960
about. They're called the thin breads.

187
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
You saw in the counter we shot up

188
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,600
earlier. So, exactly what what makes

189
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,759
them thin versus light. Well, your blade

190
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,440
slice them thinner.

191
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,960
You've got you've got less. Literally,

192
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,440
the thin bread is a thinner bread.

193
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,039
You've got less bread. Yeah. Gosh. So,

194
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,720
that's going to have fewer carbohydrates

195
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,800
because it's smaller. So, you know what

196
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,520
we do in our house? We actually cut the

197
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,600
bread ourselves. All you need is this.

198
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,120
Get a serrated knife. Looks like this,

199
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,039
guys. You don't have to be a surgeon to

200
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,000
use it. You got to toast the bread a

201
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,199
little. If you took a butter knife,

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,039
you're not you're just going to m you

203
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,720
know, mash up the bread. Get a serrated

204
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,360
knife, toast it a tiny bit to harden it

205
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,360
up, and then keep your hands on top of

206
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,880
the bread and you'll get a nice thin

207
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,880
slice. My wife can cut these things a

208
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,720
micron thickness. You can't even tell

209
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,400
there's bread on there. But all you need

210
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,400
is to be able to hold the stuff inside

211
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
the sandwich. Sure, you don't want two

212
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,039
inches of bread on either side of it and

213
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,800
it still works. By the way, it's the

214
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,639
same price. All right, so let's talk

215
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
about taste. You got a sandwich in front

216
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,240
of you. Couple different options. You

217
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,599
have regular bread to use a whole slice

218
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,360
and then put over what are you going to

219
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,840
put in the middle versus some of these

220
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,720
thin or lighter slices that you would

221
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,560
then sandwich literally the food in. So,

222
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,120
which one would you guys prefer? One

223
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,000
slice of regular, two slices of light

224
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,759
because that's the trade-off our

225
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
audience is going to make today. I'm

226
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,680
going to personally go for uh naturally

227
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,520
fermented bread in a single slice

228
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
format. That would be my choice. I sort

229
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,800
of thought you might go that way,

230
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,360
Michael. Yeah, I I love this choice.

231
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
Single bread, whole whole bread. So my

232
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,919
vote now that I've learned about the

233
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,240
importance of fermentation is to go with

234
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,720
the regular. But I think the thin is

235
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
okay too because ultimately it's good

236
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,759
portion control. So it's a nice little

237
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,960
hack to get you over the hump if you

238
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,479
don't want to take the knife like I just

239
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,759
did. But we got some options out there.

240
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,440
Take advantage of what's the industries

241
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,080
is offering to you. Back's book is

242
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,000
called the art of bread. Looks tasty on

243
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,520
the surface there. The insiders as well.

244
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,960
Check it out. When you come back we go

245
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,639
deeper into the bread aisle with the

246
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,479
wheat versus white debate. Here's the

247
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,680
question. Is whole wheat really that

248
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,240
much better for you? We'll find out

249
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,319
[Music]

250
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,960
the latest on the mysterious death of

251
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,199
Natalie Wood. Two witnesses, her

252
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,319
husband, a person of interest. Robert

253
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,560
Wagner said, "Stick to my story." Her

254
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,400
sister still waiting for justice.

255
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
Natalie Wood was pushed overboard. What

256
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,800
does her autopsy reveal? There are at

257
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,120
least 11 bruises to the back of

258
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,519
Natalie's legs. Plus, one of the most

259
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,800
infamous unsolved murders. Who killed

260
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,830
Black Dollia? He was untouchable.

261
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,880
That's coming up tomorrow.

262
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:51,360
[Music]

263
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,560
It is one of the biggest bread debates,

264
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,640
wheat or white? Now, whole wheat bread

265
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,640
outs sells all other supermarket breads,

266
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,399
but who here misses the soft white

267
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,720
pillowy stuff? That's the question we're

268
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,399
all asking. So, today we investigate, is

269
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,240
whole wheat bread really that much

270
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,839
better for you? Is it worth it? Guys,

271
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,560
who's team whole wheat here?

272
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,240
Any team whites?

273
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,080
It's broken in the middle. So, let me

274
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,800
bring in a family who's very divided

275
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,320
about this issue. Sharon, I understand

276
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,680
like so many members of my audience, and

277
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,920
you're speaking honestly. You're a big

278
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,160
white bread person. Why is that? I am

279
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,800
because the best grilled cheese is made

280
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,200
with white bread. That's a good point.

281
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,959
My girls, we go back and forth on bread.

282
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,880
And you know, I'm a chef, so it makes it

283
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,320
very hard. They give me a hard time in

284
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,240
general. In general, well, you're the

285
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
mom. But they do the I have three

286
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,839
daughters. I know what it's like. They

287
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,399
come after you. No. Oh, yeah. They see

288
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,760
every small little Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

289
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
So, you grew up with white bread. You

290
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,720
know how to make it right. There's some

291
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,240
things you just can't cheat like grilled

292
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,839
cheese. I get it. You can't. It's

293
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,040
classic. Now, I've got daughters here

294
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,160
and these are some tough daughters,

295
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,839
Dominique and Shane, I want you guys to

296
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,120
start us off. What is it that's wrong

297
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
with what your mom's doing? Why do you

298
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,839
like whole grain bread more? I mean,

299
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,720
it's healthier. You know, I'm a whole

300
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,480
grain, multigrain type of girl. That's

301
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,120
what I make my grilled cheese sandwiches

302
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,000
with. So, you know, I just think it's

303
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,279
better. And Carme and uh and Monique,

304
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,640
what what what happens at a family

305
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,360
gathering? You guys fight? You quibble?

306
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
What goes down? Um we just get both. You

307
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,760
get both. Yeah. Here, hold on to that.

308
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,880
That's right. Here's the white for you.

309
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
But if you don't mind, stay with us on

310
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
Sharon because I'm going to walk you

311
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
through this with Michael Moss, who's a

312
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,560
world expert in this area, and see if we

313
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,000
might change some minds here. Either

314
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,920
way, we'll find out. changed them.

315
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
Changed them. Change them. All right,

316
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
we're going to try to settle this food

317
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,640
debate. Michael Moss joining us with

318
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,920
some diagrams and with some evidence.

319
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,920
Okay, let's get to the truth about some

320
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,600
of these foods, nutritional truths on

321
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,279
these things. First up, calories. Is

322
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
there a difference? So, this was really

323
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,000
surprising to me. And for your viewers

324
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
who count calories when they should pay

325
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
attention to that, there's actually not

326
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
a lot of difference between the white

327
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and the whole wheat. If you're shopping

328
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,240
and making a decision just based on

329
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,440
calories, this is like not a concern

330
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,519
that you have. All right, so it's a

331
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
draw. Next up, sugar. This surprised me

332
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,959
because I didn't realize how much sugar

333
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,440
was being added to bread, white versus

334
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,640
whole grain. Um I was really surprised

335
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,920
to learn that the whole wheat bread um

336
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,920
has as much as as two or three times as

337
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,440
much sugar as the white bread. Right.

338
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,040
It's more. Yeah. It's really startling.

339
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
Like why would they have to have more

340
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,600
sugar in whole wheat, right? But if you

341
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,720
think about it, all those great things

342
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,720
in the whole wheat kernel, the the germ

343
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,040
and the brand gonna have some bitter

344
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,839
notes in there. So they're using that

345
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,600
bit of sugar to make it palatable,

346
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,760
attractive to you. So you will eat the

347
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,959
whole grain. Have we changed any minds

348
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
over there? Let me start with the

349
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,600
daughters first. No. No.

350
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,040
They own the whole wheat. I don't know.

351
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,560
Sharon, you raised some stubborn women

352
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,200
over there. How about you? How do you

353
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,000
feel about this? Well, I'm I'm not

354
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,000
really changing, but I want to keep my

355
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,440
white because nothing makes no bread

356
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,040
makes a good uh grilled cheese like a

357
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,480
white bread. Come on. Come on over here.

358
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
So, come join us at this last table.

359
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,920
See, my vote my vote is to get the whole

360
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
grains. And I'll tell you why. Whole

361
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,000
wheat has a unique set of health

362
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,200
benefits. But I hear you. So, the

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,880
question isn't are you going to have

364
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,560
only white? The question is, will you

365
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,440
have white with something else? So once

366
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,360
in a while when you're not making

367
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,880
grilled cheese or making some food that

368
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
has to have white bread in it and you

369
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,279
want to look for a whole wheat

370
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,560
varieties, you have to at least know how

371
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,079
to pick it because you got some options

372
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,600
out there. So like how do you know? So

373
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,760
you walk in the bread aisle. Yeah. And

374
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,720
color is is a big driver. Color is huge

375
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,160
and you see that throughout the

376
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,480
supermarket, right? The companies use

377
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,000
color in lots of ingenious ways. This

378
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,959
bread, for example, this one looks the

379
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,720
same as these, right? Be back. It's

380
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,480
darker than this bread, right? Y'all see

381
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,000
that? Just compare them head to head.

382
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,160
Watch this. Molasses did it. Ah, that's

383
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,680
the color. Exactly. Yeah. So, don't go

384
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,800
for the head fake. How do you tell the

385
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,720
difference? You got to look at the

386
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,399
label, do a little work. It's either

387
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,160
going to say on the front 100% whole

388
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,760
wheat or whole wheat. And then you can

389
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,240
check the fine print on the ingredients

390
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,600
and make sure that whole wheat um is the

391
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
first ingredient. And if it doesn't say

392
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,760
whole wheat, it might have a little

393
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,200
kernel or two, you know, dancing through

394
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,120
the white bread, but it's not the same.

395
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,560
It's got to say whole wheat or 100%.

396
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,680
100% whole wheat. Now, go take care of

397
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,000
those daughters of yours. God, they're

398
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,320
stubborn. Check out Michael's book. It's

399
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
called Salt, Sugar, Fat. Fabulously

400
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,399
written, very well documented. We'll be

401
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,399
right back.

402
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,360
[Music]

403
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,200
We go behind the deli counter. Now we're

404
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
revealing whether deadly bacteria is

405
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,880
lurking on your sandwich meat.

406
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,120
Investigating what you need to know

407
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,519
before you brown bag it. Which cold cut

408
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,600
lasts the longest? And are all tortilla

409
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,839
chips really created equal? Is there a

410
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,959
healthier option? That's coming up

411
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,920
Wednesday on Dr. Oz.

412
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,959
Dip your frying hair. I promise you, dip

413
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:53,240
it in here. It's gonna change your life.

414
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,240
Stop being skeptical. Dip it in.

415
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:01,040
Mhm. Taste that thing.

416
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,399
Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Daddy know what he's

417
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,639
talking about, don't he? Can I get a

418
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,639
fried dance?

419
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,040
I love that. Catch up with my fries.

420
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
Works every time. Thanks for rooting her

421
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,639
around in the right direction, Dad. You

422
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,760
all love that. Yeah, the first time a

423
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,120
child tastes ketchup, there's a reason

424
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,560
why this stuff tastes so good to us

425
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,760
because when it comes to frozen French

426
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,959
fries, there are so many options out

427
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,880
there to dip in the ketchup. You got

428
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,360
crinkle cuts, you got curies, you got

429
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,720
shoestrings, seasoned sweet potato, even

430
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,079
French fries shaped like happy emojis.

431
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,079
Going to pass these down. Don't eat them

432
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,079
all yourself. Share. All right. So,

433
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,279
investigator Marcia Gavoc is back to

434
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,959
help us figure out which of those is the

435
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,199
best. Besides the crispy, crunchy

436
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,040
deliciousness of golden fried French

437
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,800
fries, what else makes them so appealing

438
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,079
to moms and their kids? You know, for

439
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,440
one thing, there's the convenience,

440
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
right? You put them on a baking sheet,

441
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,399
you pop them in the oven, you don't have

442
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,760
to worry about it. Kids love these, but

443
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,680
there are still a lot of questions about

444
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,199
what's in this bag and exactly how

445
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,560
they're made. Let's just answer some of

446
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,480
those. The first thing we learned about

447
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,560
frozen French fries is is that they are

448
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,760
prefried. They're cooked first. I wanted

449
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,199
to bring in food scientist Taylor

450
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,360
Wallace to help us figure out the

451
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,000
process of making the fries, or at least

452
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,600
one of the ways that they're made.

453
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,880
Walk us through. I had no idea they're

454
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
already cooked. You know, I thought they

455
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,519
were healthy. They've never been fried

456
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,320
before, but they actually already are

457
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,199
cooked. So, you might be surprised.

458
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,440
Bagged frozen fries are actually cooked

459
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,680
multiple times in the manufacturing

460
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,440
facility before they're actually put

461
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,000
into the bag and sent out to the grocery

462
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,839
store. And yes, they're actually fried.

463
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
That's what gives them that wonderful

464
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,079
texture that they have when you bite

465
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,839
into them. Potatoes go through a whole

466
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,839
process to become frozen fries, mature

467
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,120
into fries. So, what I'm going to do is

468
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,800
walk you through what Taylor's talking

469
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,240
about. And I love this little animation.

470
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,360
You'll never forget it. Potatoes rolling

471
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,880
along the conveyor belt. You'll see it

472
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,800
here, right? And they're separated by

473
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,720
size to create the different styles we

474
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,560
know of, right? The classic strips. You

475
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,839
can get the rings, right? Not not an

476
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,000
accident. They're picked that way. Then

477
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,399
they travel to the steamer and the

478
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
peeler for about 10 seconds, right? That

479
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,399
makes the skin soft enough so that that

480
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,440
skin falls off when brushes are there.

481
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,399
Because they get brushed, right? They go

482
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,920
through there, they get brushed around a

483
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,000
little bit, and off goes the skin. Now,

484
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,320
workers actually inspect each potato to

485
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,920
make sure they make the cut, pardon the

486
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,079
pun. They pay close attention to the

487
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,399
look, the shape, the freshness, right?

488
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,480
No black marks. Next, after that,

489
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
they've got the chopper, right? The go

490
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,759
chopping through there, right? And

491
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,199
slices up the potato against the blades.

492
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,040
Water pushes the potatoes into those

493
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,880
blades and the conveyor belt moves all

494
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,160
those newly cut fries along. They go

495
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,839
through another inspection, right?

496
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,199
Another round. Then the blanching

497
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,680
process. Now, here's the important part.

498
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,120
The fries are placed in hot water to

499
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,959
cold water real quickly. It's like like

500
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,800
being in a spa, right? To firm up the

501
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,800
flesh and make the potatoes flavor that

502
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
much more pronounced and then into the

503
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,120
fryer again for approximately 2 minutes

504
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,920
to become partially cooked. Partially

505
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,279
cooked. The newly parcooked fries are

506
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,440
frozen and then the weighed bags are

507
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,000
delivered to the grocery store. So once

508
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,519
you get to that bag of frozen fries, you

509
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,279
can crack it open, lay them out in a

510
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,440
baking sheet and put them back in the

511
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,560
oven again for the third time. I guess

512
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
that's cook them all the way through. Is

513
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,360
that all right? Yeah. So what happens

514
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,280
is, as you mentioned, is when they're

515
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,360
cooked in the factory, those cooks are

516
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,959
par cooks, which means they're only

517
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,799
partially cooked. So what you have to do

518
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,480
when you get home is you lay them out,

519
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,880
you have to cook them all the way

520
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,480
through to kill any potential bacteria.

521
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,160
You have to make sure you check the bag

522
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,600
for the cooking time and temperature

523
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,039
because you do really want to make sure

524
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,640
that you finish the cooking process.

525
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,360
Okay, next up, some of these frozen

526
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,640
French fries are pre-browned. Taylor,

527
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,079
the secret ingredient, since you're the

528
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,440
food scientist here, how do they do it?

529
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,200
Okay, so you're not going to like this,

530
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,400
Dr. your eyes. But the secret ingredient

531
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,960
is actually sugar. Sugar to brown them.

532
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,480
Yes. So, in fact, in your organic

533
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,880
products, you're going to see something

534
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,320
like apple juice concentrate. In your

535
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,559
regular products, you're going to see

536
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,559
just regular dextrous, which is just

537
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,160
regular sugar, and that's because it's

538
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,280
cheaper. I like how you start smiling

539
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,400
when you start talking about fries. All

540
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,320
right, Taylor, thank you very much.

541
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,120
Makes me happy. I throw it over. So, we

542
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,799
asked sweet potato fries

543
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,720
whether they're healthier than regular

544
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,400
fries. It's an endless debate. Jennifer

545
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,679
from our audience came in today to

546
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,200
arguing that in fact there is a

547
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,120
difference. She knows it for sure. Do

548
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,559
you buy the frozen sweet potato fries? I

549
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,480
do. And what do you tell your kids? Are

550
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,720
they healthier? Much healthier. I have a

551
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,640
grandson that doesn't like uh much

552
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,080
healthy foods and he actually likes the

553
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
sweet potato. He goes for this. He goes

554
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
for this. He doesn't like any

555
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,720
vegetables, but he goes for So the nice

556
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,440
thing about the show is we tell you the

557
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,520
truth. So Mara did a deep tubular dive.

558
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,080
Okay. Right. She learned all about

559
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,520
potatoes of every type. Please explain

560
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,919
if there's a difference what it is.

561
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,600
Okay. There is and there isn't. So,

562
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,600
nutritionally, there's not much

563
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,919
difference between sweet potato fries

564
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,360
and regular white potato fries. But

565
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,160
where there is a really big difference

566
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,039
is with the glycemic index. Sweet potato

567
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,240
fries have a much lower glycemic index.

568
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,320
So, it's a little bit of good, a little

569
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
bit of bad. Wow. Well, at this point, if

570
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
he's eating, you'll be happy. But you

571
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,679
want to train those taste buds. Eat

572
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,039
things that really do matter. And

573
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,039
there's some good news in the frozen

574
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,080
section. Now, they're actually frozen

575
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,840
veggie fries. Really true veggie fries.

576
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,840
They're made from carrots.

577
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,000
green beans, broccoli, there's a bunch

578
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,200
here. Mar Jennifer and I are going to

579
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,280
taste these if you walk us through

580
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,440
exactly what these are. Yeah. So, these

581
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,600
are packed with nutrients. It's a great

582
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,440
way to sneak some vitamins into your

583
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,840
children. So, they are a good option,

584
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,280
but again, there's always a catch. You

585
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,440
can't fool yourself into thinking that

586
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,679
this is a serving of vegetables. It's

587
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,960
not. But they are a good option. What do

588
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,919
you think, Jennifer? Give us a

589
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,720
kids. I think they're good. Yeah,

590
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,240
grandson might take it. I think so.

591
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,919
Like you said, French fries would never

592
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,280
be a health food, but I'm glad to see a

593
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,720
movement towards better options. Proud

594
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,200
of you all. Buy the healthier stuff.

595
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,200
We'll be right back.

596
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,360
Up next, how much cream should you be

597
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,120
putting in your coffee? Missed the big

598
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,640
hot debate you don't want to miss. Plus,

599
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,020
we're investigating the new coffee

600
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:51,520
creamers at your supermarket.

601
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:53,440
[Applause]

602
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,440
We've been investigating the new foods

603
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
popping up in your supermarket and now

604
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,280
it's time to look into the new coffee

605
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,360
creamers you may be mixing into your

606
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,520
daily cup of Joe. We are investigating

607
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,880
what's in these creamers. We're also

608
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,799
going to tackle the question breaking

609
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,520
the internet. Which coffee and cream

610
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,600
type are you? Here's the scale, guys.

611
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,919
Find yourselves. Are you a B2? Like up

612
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,000
here right there. B2s, you know, you

613
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,520
like your coffee a little extra creamy

614
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,520
or, you know, that's what my wife does,

615
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,000
by the way. It's basically beige coffee.

616
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,400
Or are you a F5 right over here? See the

617
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,080
F5? Right? Just a little drop of cream

618
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,679
in there. Not too much, right? You want

619
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,840
to keep it nice and dark, right? You

620
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,360
find yourself in here. But before we get

621
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,400
to what kind you are, I want to talk

622
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,919
about what you're putting in there to

623
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,679
make it look that color. Nutritionist

624
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,240
Kelly and Patricia is here to break it

625
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,159
all down for us. Knowledgeable in all

626
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,400
these things.

627
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,559
So, we got half and half. We got the

628
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,760
milk, we got the creamer. What is the

629
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,120
real difference between these things?

630
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,200
So, let's break this down. Let's start

631
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,280
with the creamer. So, creamer, this

632
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,320
comes in either a liquid or a powdered

633
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,919
form. And as you know, this is the rage

634
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
with coffee drinkers. They love to put

635
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,919
creamer in. But here's what these

636
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,080
everyday coffee drinkers don't know is

637
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,080
that guess what? I was so surprised to

638
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,320
find out there's not a lot of creamer

639
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,320
milk in the creamer. There's just simply

640
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,400
not. No. companies are using other

641
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,880
ingredients to get it to taste and feel

642
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,400
like creamer, but there's no creamer.

643
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,559
And what about regular milk, for

644
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,039
example, versus half and half? Okay, so

645
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,559
regular milk has about 0 to 3% milk fat.

646
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,600
So, it's not going to give you that same

647
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,200
creaminess as half and half. I did a

648
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,400
little homework just on the calories,

649
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,159
and there's not a lot of difference

650
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,360
between a creamer and your half and half

651
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,159
when it comes to calories. They're

652
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,760
almost identical. Milk has less calories

653
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,600
than the other two, but you usually put

654
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,760
more milk in your coffee or your tea.

655
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
So, you probably end up with something

656
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,360
similar. So, don't torture yourself just

657
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,039
on calories alone. Let's zero in on

658
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,240
these traditional creamers which come in

659
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,760
plastic containers. They're in the

660
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,320
refrigerated section of your store. They

661
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,440
look like this. So, if these creamers

662
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,640
don't have a lot of cream in them, as

663
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,960
you just highlighted, what are they made

664
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,400
up of? So, so funny because we put them

665
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,640
in the refrigerator, but I want everyone

666
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,640
to know that I I wonder if this is for

667
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,640
show sometimes because there are some

668
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,960
countries that actually keep them on the

669
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,400
shelf. These these creamers, some these

670
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,840
creamers, some of them are actually kept

671
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,760
on the shelf. So, you know, who's to

672
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,760
say? But I will tell you this, a lot of

673
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,000
these creamers had about 10 different

674
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,840
ingredients and guess what? They weren't

675
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,200
milk and cream. No. But you know what I

676
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,960
think about when I see that? I just know

677
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,000
it's a processed food. Simple as that.

678
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,440
And that we're eating something more

679
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,280
processed. A lot of times folks say that

680
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,720
it's non-dairy, but in fact, if you look

681
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,720
at the label, there are little milk

682
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,159
derivatives in there. Yeah. So, you have

683
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,320
to be careful of that. So, when I looked

684
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
at a lot of these labels, they did say a

685
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,360
dairyfree product, but what that means,

686
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,440
Dr. Oz, is it doesn't have lactose. It

687
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,559
doesn't mean it doesn't have case. So,

688
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,640
again, if you don't have a big time

689
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,080
problem with dairy or, you know, that's

690
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,440
okay. Then you can this is just going to

691
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,880
be fine for you. But if you do happen to

692
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,120
have a big issue, pay attention to that.

693
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,200
Again, how about the the creamers that

694
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,120
come with all these flavors? I see the

695
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,200
the cinnamon bun flavors. They have

696
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,640
candy bar flavors. I don't understand

697
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,000
how this even comes into a creamer

698
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,679
category. Well, it's great. Like

699
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,280
desserts. It it is like desserts. And

700
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,400
here's what I want you to think about.

701
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,159
For every two tablespoons, you're going

702
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,159
to have about 12 g of sugar. So, let me

703
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,000
ask you a question. Would you walk out

704
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,600
of the house in the morning and pop two

705
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,280
chocolate chip cookies in your mouth?

706
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,400
No. Well, that's what you're getting.

707
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,760
So, you don't want to start with all

708
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,799
that sugar. And it's not just sugar.

709
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,720
They have other things they add to them

710
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,760
as well. So these I get really concerned

711
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,679
about because of the sugar and because

712
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,039
it's not real as you should. These may

713
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,960
be okay depending on whether you got an

714
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,320
issue with dairy or not. So okay, next

715
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,000
time we think of creamers, the new

716
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,520
non-dairy alternatives. There are

717
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,880
almond, there's soy, there's even

718
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,799
coconut creamers out there. One of my

719
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,559
viewers, Marie, has been here trying

720
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,679
these out. What do you like about these

721
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,520
creamers? Uh I love the fact that they

722
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,440
make you healthy. Um I love the fact

723
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,200
that you can also get flavor involved

724
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,440
without all the excess sugars and the

725
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,760
calories. So I'm trying to be healthy.

726
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,760
I'm trying to lose some weight. So these

727
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,280
are much better alternatives than the

728
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,799
others. What appears to be working. So

729
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,840
keep it up. Thank you. What surprising

730
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,520
ingredients have you found here? So

731
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,960
again, we have almond, soy, which is and

732
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,640
these coconut creamers have gotten very

733
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,120
popular. So let me talk about what I

734
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,880
like. I like the fact that opposed to a

735
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,559
lot of the other creamers, they actually

736
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,720
have as the first ingredient on a lot of

737
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,640
these coconut or soy or almond, which is

738
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,799
amazing. But if you look down the

739
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,320
ingredient list a little bit further,

740
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,480
what you're going to see is some added

741
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,480
sugars which you have to watch out for.

742
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,840
And also those those milk derivatives,

743
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,360
they're on the table. There's good,

744
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,799
there's not so good. But I've got a cup

745
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,559
of a new creamer I want you to try

746
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,720
that's not on this table. Okay. Are you

747
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,919
ready? Yes. Okay. Now look at the color.

748
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,400
Notice it's goldeny appearance. And now

749
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,760
as you taste it, I as you taste it, I

750
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,520
want everyone to take a look at this new

751
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,159
non-dairy creamer trend from a good

752
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,200
friend of mine. It's uh it's called Fat.

753
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,200
Mhm. Check it out. Hey, Dr. Oz, you know

754
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,200
that I love my morning cup of brew. And

755
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,960
look at how creamy and frothy my coffee

756
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,120
looks. You might be surprised to learn

757
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,279
that I didn't use any milk or cream in

758
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,600
this brew. No, all I used were two

759
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,000
ingredients. One of them is ghee, and

760
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,279
the other is MCT oil. Now, both of these

761
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,080
ingredients have become very trendy

762
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,919
lately. MCT oil has been linked to uh

763
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,440
weight loss and even improved cognitive

764
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,720
function in a handful of very small

765
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,039
studies. Ghee, look at how pure that

766
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,200
looks.

767
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,440
People that are dairy sensitive tend to

768
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,640
do very well with ghee. And all you do

769
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,039
is you combine ghee with a little bit of

770
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,000
MCT oil, which is right there. It's very

771
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,080
clear, in your coffee, blend it up, and

772
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,640
you get this beautiful, delicious,

773
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,799
creamy brew. You don't need any milk or

774
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,679
cream. Check that out.

775
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,520
So, we've been tasting it. Is it creamy

776
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,520
enough? It is absolutely creamy. It

777
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,440
completely coated my mouth. It was just

778
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,559
delicious. An explosion of flavor. I

779
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,559
love it. Look at that. Max is on to

780
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,240
something. I must say it's caught on

781
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,320
fire right now because people like the

782
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,919
fact it keeps them full all day long and

783
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,159
let's caffeine last a little longer

784
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,000
probably as well. So Max, he's out

785
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,279
there. So Kelly, of all longer that's

786
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,720
good. Yeah. Of all the supermarket

787
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,000
trends you identified, all the creamers

788
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,120
we looked out there, what were we

789
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,559
looking for? What's the most important

790
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,320
things to check out? Well, for me

791
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,080
personally, I love almond milk. It just

792
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,559
has a taste I like. But if you're not

793
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,240
into all those milk alternative milks, I

794
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,600
actually really like half and half

795
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,039
because you're going to have that creamy

796
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,120
richness and I like the nutritional

797
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,640
profile that it offers. But always just

798
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,640
look, as we always talk about on the

799
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,559
show, you want that shorter ingredient

800
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,320
list. And remember what we talked about,

801
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,520
these products don't have milk and cream

802
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,039
in them. So when you're looking at the

803
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,880
label, make sure it has milk and cream.

804
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,080
Simple as that. Simple, simple. It makes

805
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,720
sense. Glad you enjoyed the little

806
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,799
surprise here. Dr. Nice to meet you. Cuz

807
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,200
up next, it's the biggest debate on the

808
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,360
internet. Which coffee cup are you? Look

809
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,520
carefully. Just how much creamer should

810
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,200
you really be putting into your coffee?

811
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,490
You got to vote. You're somewhere on

812
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,720
that list. Be right back.

813
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,559
[Music]

814
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,559
I love getting to talk with you on my

815
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,720
show every single day. But when the

816
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,039
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

817
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,039
is not over. I still have a lot that I

818
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,840
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

819
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:59,559
Oz podcast on Apple Podcast or wherever

820
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,559
you get your podcast.

821
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,159
We've been investigating coffee creamers

822
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,400
and now it's time to answer the big

823
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,720
question dividing the internet. How much

824
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,640
creamer should you be pouring into your

825
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,240
cup of coffee? So, which cup of coffee

826
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,600
are you? Look at this, right? Pick the

827
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
cup that looks like you. Do you drink

828
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,000
your coffee light with a lot of cream or

829
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,840
is it dark with barely any cream in it?

830
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,679
So, I took a coffee creamer poll before

831
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,960
the show to see what you're all really

832
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,520
drinking. 27% of my audience said they

833
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,880
liked their copy light and white. Did

834
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,039
not realize that. That's more than I

835
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,159
expected. 73% of the audience like their

836
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,320
copy towards the other end of the

837
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,159
spectrum. Dark brown. Some even like

838
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,919
black with nothing added to it. So that

839
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,440
stated we all have our biases. So coffee

840
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,480
lovers Lori and Mariana from our

841
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,960
audience are standing by standing in our

842
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,159
coffee scale. All right. So two of you

843
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,600
are going to be our taste testers today.

844
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,360
Walk over to the tasting table. Taste

845
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,559
the concoctions we're about to describe

846
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,240
to the audience. I want some honest

847
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,440
feedback. Tell us what works. So, what

848
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,880
doesn't work for your pallets? Fair

849
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,320
enough. So, wherever you are, guys,

850
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,000
light, dark, you got someone who speaks

851
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,000
for you. Go taste it up. Okay, let's

852
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,840
head over to the coffee lab.

853
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,559
Nutritionist Kellyanne Patrrui and

854
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,480
barista Sam Keliso are here. They have

855
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,120
been experimenting to help uncover the

856
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,240
perfect coffee creamer formula. You got

857
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,279
to put the right amount of coffee with

858
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,559
the right amount of creamer so you can

859
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,640
still enjoy the taste and get the health

860
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,559
benefits too. So, Kelly, you are filling

861
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,000
up your mug with a lot of stuff. It

862
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,360
looks pretty white to me. Is this if

863
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,039
that's what people are doing, is there a

864
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,720
better solution? What what what is the

865
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,480
coffee benefit of that looking coffee?

866
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,480
Well, if your coffee ends up looking

867
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,720
like this, then you're probably

868
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,960
discounting all of the health benefits

869
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,799
of coffee because actually coffee is a

870
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,320
really low calorie drink. But what

871
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,799
people don't realize is when you add all

872
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,559
the pizzazz of the creamers, it adds up

873
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:46,720
really quick to the tune of about 280

874
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:50,480
calories and about 12 gram of fat. Okay.

875
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,600
So, if you take about 8 oz of coffee and

876
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:57,360
you add in one just a quarter of whole

877
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,120
milk, bam, that will really set you off

878
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,799
for the right track all day. That's our

879
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,240
energy formula. Let's get to the flavor

880
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,760
formula. Let's go to the barista. This

881
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,880
one I want it to really taste great. And

882
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,640
you know, coffee purists think adding

883
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,720
too much cream takes away from the

884
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,799
coffee flavor. So, what's your formula?

885
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,399
Well, let's be honest. Coffee with some

886
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,440
people don't know is kind of like wine.

887
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,919
You know, it's filled with different

888
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,440
flavors and notes. like wine, you want

889
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,039
it to compliment whatever you're putting

890
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,120
in it or with it. I mean, you're not

891
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,559
going to put ice in your wine cuz it'll

892
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,159
dilute it. So, why are you going to put

893
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,880
something bad in your coffee? Coffee has

894
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,520
this natural nutty flavor to it. And

895
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,440
like Kellyanne says, a/4 cup is the

896
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,360
perfect amount cuz it still embraces all

897
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,399
that flavor. But I like oat milk. And

898
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,080
you have to worry about it. It's

899
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,159
guiltfree cuz I mean, you know, in the

900
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,679
morning you have oatmeal for breakfast

901
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,080
cuz it's a good healthy breakfast. So,

902
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,240
why not add oat milk into your coffee?

903
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,840
Okay, now I don't drink a lot of coffee.

904
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,039
I mentioned that. I admit that I got

905
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,640
used to not drinking coffee because in

906
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,240
the hospital you really don't want to.

907
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,200
So when that happens and you want a

908
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,279
little pickme up, you run into an

909
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,000
impass. So I've figured out some hacks.

910
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,159
So Paulie, our great camera uh uh ex

911
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,159
expert is also an expert in espresso.

912
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,200
Puts a little pinch of cinnamon in my

913
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,480
coffee. I don't really like a lot of

914
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,360
sugar in it. The cinnamon is a good

915
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,120
hack. It'll work for you.

916
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,640
My favorite and it actually helps you if

917
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,320
you got blood sugar problems, but when

918
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,840
I'm on the go and I can't take my camera

919
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,080
team with me, unfortunately. I wish I

920
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,919
could. I wish I could. I'm starting to

921
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,480
like this. It's nitro coffee. Have you

922
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,200
guys heard of this? All right. So,

923
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,120
listen. It's my favorite. Nitro coffee

924
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,279
is when nitrogen is actually added to

925
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,039
the coffee and then the bottle is

926
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,520
pressurized. So, when it comes out, see

927
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,240
how creamy it looks? You see that cream?

928
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,399
There's no cream in it. That, my

929
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,559
friends,

930
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,120
it's all mechanical. And I'm starting to

931
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,039
love the fact that we can get the same

932
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,120
taste as adding sugar and cream to your

933
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,960
coffee by mechanically mixing coffee up

934
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,399
with a little nitrogen. So now we have

935
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,600
our taste testers. Lori Mariana, you are

936
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,039
speaking for the light coffee drinkers

937
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,240
and the dark coffee drinkers. What have

938
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:58,960
you liked so far, Lori? Uh I prefer the

939
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,840
one in the middle. It has um it's sweet.

940
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,480
There's a little nuttiness to it. That

941
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,159
that's that's the oat milk. Yes. I like

942
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,640
it. And the flavor works for you. Yeah,

943
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,399
the flavor works for me. All right,

944
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,240
you you tend to like it a little darker.

945
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,840
What do you think? Well, I tasted this

946
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,360
one. It looks creamy. It doesn't taste

947
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,720
creamy to me there. And it's like a

948
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,880
little bit bitter. I feel like I need to

949
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,600
add a lot of sugar to that. This, on the

950
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,120
other hand, um doesn't look like it has

951
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,520
any cream or anything in it, but it

952
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,799
tastes so much richer and bolder. Nitro

953
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,399
coffee. Yes.

954
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,760
Bottom line, I'm learning from you and

955
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,760
I'm learning myself from our experts

956
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,880
here. Taste stuff, guys. Do something

957
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,399
different than what you have always

958
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,679
done. We've got all these habits in life

959
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,880
and the amount of creamer and the kind

960
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,320
of creamer we add to our coffee is one

961
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,519
of them. Just mix it up. Take advantage

962
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,519
of all the technology that's out there

963
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,519
and these new ideas. You you might enjoy

964
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,880
what you find, especially going on a

965
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,290
different kind of a caffeine bus. We'll

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,440
be right back. A toast.

The latest on the mysterious death of

Natalie Wood. Two witnesses. Her

husband, a person of interest. Robert

sister still waiting for justice.

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,960
Natalie was pushed overboard. What does

her autopsy reveal? That's coming up

977
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,720
Ah, the summer it brings a lot of beauty

978
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,480
benefits, but the increase in

979
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,799
temperature and humidity means an

980
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,880
increase in frizz. And when the heat's

981
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,120
on, I know too many of you say it's a

982
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,960
struggle to have a good hair day. So to

983
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,480
help me tame your frizz, I brought in

984
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,279
Dr. Jenny Thomas, who's here on behalf

985
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,159
of my trusted sponsor partner, Hank Key.

986
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,640
Why do we get frizzy hair? It happens to

987
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,799
so many of us. It's because our hair

988
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,039
absorbs humidity from the air. I mean,

989
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,760
your hair can absorb up to 30% of its

990
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,679
own weight in water. It's crazy. My hair

991
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,919
gets heavy, I guess. Well, you might

992
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,919
feel it. you what you will see is as

993
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,840
your hair swells the curvature the

994
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,440
texture will revert to something that

995
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,399
most people would describe as out of

996
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,039
control and not what they want. So you

997
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,799
can see here we've taken hair and we've

998
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:14,000
put it into a room that's 80° and 80%

999
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,799
humidity. So think beach summer sounds

1000
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,120
gorgeous not necessarily great hair.

1001
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,679
That's over only an hour that that much

1002
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,919
change has happened. Yes, it's happening

1003
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,559
every single day. Okay, it it grew

1004
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,120
magic. It does. And the more damaged

1005
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,120
your hair is, the more and the faster

1006
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,679
that this happens. And that's because

1007
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,000
his hair is damaged, um, it becomes more

1008
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,840
porous. And so it's absorbing that

1009
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,880
humidity like a sponge. So when people

1010
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,960
see that and they're not happy with

1011
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,000
their hair, we make mistakes as we try

1012
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,760
as we try to tame the frizz. Yes. So so

1013
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,840
many of us, the first thing we do is go

1014
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,960
to heat styling because it's a great way

1015
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,720
to get back to smooth. And that's okay

1016
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,279
as long as your hair doesn't see too

1017
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,320
much heat. Where it becomes a problem is

1018
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,679
when that heat becomes so high, bigger

1019
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,840
issues come into play. How many heat

1020
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,240
stylers are there here? Yeah, I thought

1021
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,519
so. All the women, the bald men didn't

1022
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,120
put their hands up. Come on over. All

1023
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,399
right. So, I know eliminating all the

1024
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,399
heat isn't an option. You're not going

1025
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,879
to do that. But Dr. Thomas says a heat

1026
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,720
protectant spray may help. So, I built

1027
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,399
you some models. These high-tech models

1028
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,480
represent your hair in a ponytail. All

1029
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,560
right. I'll be the average person who's

1030
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,839
using products that are not designed to

1031
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,200
protect the hair or don't use any

1032
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,879
products at all, which is probably for a

1033
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,760
lot of us what goes down. And that means

1034
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,879
your hair is exposed to extreme heat.

1035
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,159
So, let me just pull out one little

1036
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,480
fiber here. Right. There's a little

1037
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,839
fiber. Right. So, I take my normal hair

1038
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,960
product and I just want to straighten

1039
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,919
it. I'm just straighten this up right

1040
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,079
here. Ready? Watch this. Oh, jeez. That

1041
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,480
was messy. Well, let me just try again.

1042
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,919
Okay. Just in case. All right. So he can

1043
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,839
get a little bit of hair and all you go

1044
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,839
and oh,

1045
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,760
let's go back in slow-mo, folks. That's

1046
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,040
literally what I did here. But

1047
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,280
figuratively, it's what's happening to

1048
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,800
you. Look at that. All that muck that

1049
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,320
starts to fly away is your hair getting

1050
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,160
destroyed as you apply heat to it when

1051
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,240
it's not protected. Dr. Thomas, please

1052
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,240
do it your way since you're the expert.

1053
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,640
So, a really good heat protectant

1054
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,800
product should disperse that heat very

1055
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,359
evenly because you had an extreme hot

1056
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,960
spot happen that can lead to more frizz

1057
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,760
or can even lead to breakage. So, I'm

1058
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,760
going to show you how this works. You do

1059
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,280
the same thing. Just give it a couple

1060
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,760
spritzes before you apply the heat.

1061
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,400
And you can see that you can smooth out

1062
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,320
that unruly texture while still

1063
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,839
shielding your hair from extreme

1064
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,800
temperatures.

1065
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,160
Don't you hate a show off? This drives

1066
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,280
you crazy when someone's just good at

1067
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,040
something. Come on over here. So, what

1068
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,960
do you recommend to protect your hair

1069
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,720
from frizz, which so many of us are

1070
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,800
going to experience in the summer? So,

1071
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,560
you definitely want to beat the heat,

1072
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,880
and I think the best way to do that is

1073
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,599
with Pantene's thermal heat protectant

1074
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,720
spray that you see here. So, this can

1075
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,160
protect your hair up to 450 degrees,

1076
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,920
which is how hot some of these flat

1077
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,079
irons can get. So, go me through the

1078
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,280
routine. So, a after you've protected it

1079
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,839
while you apply the heat, then what do

1080
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,160
you do to sort of seal it in? So once

1081
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:06,480
you've got your dry styled hair just

1082
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,640
like you want, it's in control. Then

1083
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,000
what you want to do is help hold on to

1084
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,480
that as you're going to go throughout

1085
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,440
your day. So I like to finish it off

1086
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,680
with the Pantene airspray. So it's a

1087
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,680
finishing spray that's free of drying

1088
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,720
alcohols and it's especially good for

1089
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,520
these hot humid days. So, we use these

1090
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,960
humidity resistant polymers and it gives

1091
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,680
hair a flexible hold um while also

1092
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,079
working to resist humidity and more

1093
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,000
frizz. So, I think many of us have had

1094
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,480
the experience you use a styling

1095
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,400
product, it's humid outside and all of a

1096
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,440
sudden it feels like a sticky gummy

1097
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,920
mess. So, these resist that humidity so

1098
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,000
you can keep the look that you created

1099
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,680
without the stickiness and also without

1100
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,280
the stiffness. All right. So, if you

1101
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,240
don't mind, just do a little demo.

1102
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,320
You're about to go out in the day and

1103
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,000
it's humid. So, what do you do? Super

1104
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,880
easy. All you do is just take that dry

1105
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,480
styled hair, give it a simple spritz.

1106
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,359
You can see a little bit goes a long

1107
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,560
way, but it's also it still moves. It's

1108
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,320
flexible. It's not stiff or sticky. Come

1109
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,240
on over here. Now, Chen Alexander has

1110
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,599
been protecting her hair against frizz.

1111
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,200
She's also joining us on behalf of

1112
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,079
Pantene. So, how would you typically

1113
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,760
describe your hair this summer? Well, I

1114
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,760
uh I'm going to do a big spoiler alert.

1115
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Oh, please. For your audience. I'm not a

1116
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,119
natural blonde.

1117
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,880
Uh so, with my very very dyed hair, it

1118
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,599
tends to be really brittle and really

1119
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,079
wavy. So, in the summertime, it just

1120
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,000
blows up. So, I've managed to kind of

1121
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,680
keep it sleek here today. Look good like

1122
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,520
that. Mhm. So, give me your normal

1123
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,040
routine. What do you do? The hair

1124
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,119
routine that we should all be trying.

1125
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,960
Yes. Okay. So, I wash my hair every

1126
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,960
couple days. I don't wash it every day

1127
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,720
to keep kind of like the hold and less

1128
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,920
heat styling on my hair in general. Good

1129
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,920
for you. But thank you. Um and then I go

1130
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,000
ahead and put the thermal the the

1131
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,000
thermal heat protectant on it before I

1132
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,480
blow dry. But I'm I'm doing the bad

1133
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,200
thing where I'm using two types of heat

1134
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,880
on my hair. The blow dryer and then I'm

1135
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,040
going over another pass with the flat

1136
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,800
iron. So that really protects my hair

1137
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,640
from the heat. And then I do the

1138
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,720
airspray all over to kind of lock it in

1139
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,640
all day. Because from my house to the

1140
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,960
subway, which is one block, if I don't

1141
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,839
use a heat protectant and a hairspray,

1142
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,359
it's like giant frizzy mess. Right. So

1143
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,800
if if it was a mess before, you've

1144
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,160
gotten a meaningful result by using a

1145
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,760
heat protectant. Absolutely. You're

1146
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,760
happy with it? Yes. Dr. Thomas, how

1147
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,320
typical are those results? So very

1148
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,000
typical. And you get those frizz

1149
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,480
reducing benefits from the first time

1150
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,240
you use it. But Chen and I have very

1151
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,000
different hair types. Even though it may

1152
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,400
not look so different right now, she's

1153
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,320
actually got quite a coarse texture, a

1154
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
lot of bleach, I have a much finer

1155
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,800
texture. So, we've both used the heat

1156
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,440
protectant spray and the airspray, and

1157
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,079
we still get to our what we want for

1158
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,440
this version of controlled defined look.

1159
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,119
So, where can you find the Pentene

1160
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,520
thermal heat protectant spray and also

1161
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,599
the the the air not hairspray, airspray?

1162
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,880
Exactly. So, you can find it at most

1163
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,680
grocery stores, um drugstores, and mass

1164
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,880
retailers like Walmart. Who here wants a

1165
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,760
little bit of hairspray for their frizzy

1166
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,280
hair? Hands up. All right. So, we're

1167
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,480
going to go around the audience. You

1168
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,839
take that side. I'll take the middle

1169
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,280
part. We're just going to spray your

1170
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,599
hair just a little bit. We got one

1171
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,800
contain. Is that good? No. They're not

1172
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,320
happy with that. This audience, they're

1173
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,839
the smartest in television. So, thanks

1174
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,240
to my partner, Pantene, you will all be

1175
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,560
receiving your own Pantene thermal heat

1176
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,960
protectant spray and the Pantene air

1177
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,960
spray. We'll be right back. Share it.

1178
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,179
[Applause]

1179
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,560
What do all these Insta posts have in

1180
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,440
common? Right, they're all part of the

1181
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,760
latest viral trend. Hashtag procrastic

1182
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,079
cleaning. The mission putting off

1183
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,760
whatever task is at hand by scrubbing,

1184
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:54,560
vacuuming, rearranging, maybe even

1185
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,240
deciding to go fullon Mary Condo. You've

1186
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,079
all done it. I've heard about it. And we

1187
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,160
have a procrastic cleaner here today

1188
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,280
who's about to be turned in. Are you all

1189
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,680
ready?

1190
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,440
Whose spotless kitchen is this? Now look

1191
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,839
carefully.

1192
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,000
Are you Lisa? I'm Lisa. Yes. Before I

1193
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,839
get to Lisa, Robin, why just had you

1194
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,800
turn your friend in? Your former friend?

1195
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:18,560
Because she loves to clean. Like how so?

1196
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,720
Like she'll come to my house and clean

1197
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,880
my kitchen.

1198
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,560
That's loving to clean. I mean that that

1199
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,720
is an impeccable kitchen. What gives?

1200
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,200
How are you avoiding

1201
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,400
a big mess? Well, you avoid the mess.

1202
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,280
But I mean to spend that much time

1203
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,320
cleaning your kitchen, there might be

1204
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,359
other things in your life you're not

1205
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,000
doing. Grocery shopping, organizing

1206
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,839
clothes, a lot of other tasks, too. Come

1207
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,119
on over here. I might open your open

1208
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,200
your eyes. You can hold the mic if you

1209
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,640
want. Take a little walk here to the

1210
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,400
monitor. So there's actually some good

1211
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,880
news here because many folks choose to

1212
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,800
procrast procrastinate

1213
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,240
because clutter, right, is not the best

1214
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,560
thing in the world. It's linked to all

1215
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,720
kinds of negative emotions. So when you

1216
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,640
look at a cluttered spot, right, it

1217
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,079
creates this feeling that you've got

1218
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,359
negative emotions around you. There's

1219
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,839
stress, there's anger, there's

1220
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,440
frustration, tension, worry, right? You

1221
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,359
don't want those, right? When the space

1222
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,520
is clean, we get rid of all this extra

1223
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,119
clutter in there. It's like those

1224
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,720
beautiful positive emotions, the

1225
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,440
happiness, the calm, they can actually

1226
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,800
evolve and float and elevate you. Now,

1227
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,200
here's the part that I want you to focus

1228
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,880
on. Researchers are saying that folks

1229
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,480
who gravitate towards repetitive

1230
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,880
behaviors like cleaning their kitchen as

1231
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,119
meticulously as Lisa does in times of

1232
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,200
stress do it because you need a sense of

1233
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,440
control in life. Does that sound

1234
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,680
familiar to you? It does. Yes. All

1235
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,240
right. So, procrastinating

1236
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,280
to a limit after to a limit to a limit.

1237
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,800
After that, you got to deal with the

1238
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,640
real issues that are worrying you. Now,

1239
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,079
since you have been procrastinating so

1240
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,160
effectively, I'm going to give you a

1241
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,839
time-saving hack from another audience

1242
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,520
member. So, you can't spend as much time

1243
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,680
procrastinating. You have to get back to

1244
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,520
the big issues in life. So, Ya, how are

1245
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,800
you? I'm great. So, show us the hack you

1246
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,000
got that might save Lisa enough time

1247
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,760
that she can go back and deal with the

1248
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,520
big issues in her life. So, when you're

1249
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,200
trying to procrastinate on some things,

1250
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,400
you can Everybody has these laying

1251
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,440
around on the floor, that kind of thing.

1252
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,599
You can use these. These are dryer

1253
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,960
sheets. Yes, dryer sheets. You can just

1254
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,599
use these to kind of clean up different

1255
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,520
things. You can use them to dust. You

1256
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,839
can use them to polish things off and

1257
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,160
you can also use them to even clean soap

1258
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,079
scum in your bathroom. So, one dryer

1259
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,839
sheet, take it to the kitchen, give the

1260
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,280
kids some chores, and then things you

1261
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,640
got to focus on aren't about the kids.

1262
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,920
It's about you. I'll tell you a little

1263
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,040
secret that I learned. It's your kids

1264
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,079
aren't going to treat themselves the way

1265
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,280
you treat them. They're going to treat

1266
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,599
the way themselves the way you treat

1267
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,119
yourself. That's what needs to be dealt.

1268
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,400
We're into this? Yes. All right. Little

1269
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,880
gift from the show. Cleaning something?

1270
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,079
Yes. No. Just just start scrubbing here

1271
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,760
and we'll come down to my dressing room

1272
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,760
afterwards. All right. Lisa, thank you

1273
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,359
very much, Lisa. The owner. Thank you so

1274
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,720

1275
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,040

1276
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,040
