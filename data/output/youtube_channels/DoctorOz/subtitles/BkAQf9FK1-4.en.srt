00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:08,480
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,400
It's almost the halfway mark, so today

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,480
I've got the tricks to surviving the

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,719
weekend without falling off the total 10

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,000
rapid weight loss plan. Ty is here now.

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,920
She's been on the planet and has lost a

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,480
total of 15 pounds.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,760
Now, like so many of the viewers, uh you

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,880
wrote in saying you're really worried

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,400
about the weekends. You think you're

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,560
going to gain weight with us? You know,

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,560
I would gain weight because my husband

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,719
and my daughter are foodies. They eat

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
burgers, pizza, anything you can name.

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
They eat it. And I don't want to be

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,079
tempted to go off my little weight loss

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
plan. Can we have an honest

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,399
conversation? Yes. This is not a time to

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,680
go out there partying it up. This is the

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,680
weekend I want you to sort of hunker

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,879
down. I'm going to make it fun, okay?

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,239
But you can't go out there and blow

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,920
everything. We're going to reevaluate

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,120
what you expect to do on a weekend,

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,079
right? Let's get through it. These are

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,360
two weeks going to make a huge

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
difference in your life. So, we're going

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,360
to recreate your weekend to make it easy

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,879
to do the right thing. Next 48 hours,

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,239
you will win and lose this battle. We're

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,120
going to do it together. Okay. The first

32
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,320
thing we're going to do, and it's a huge

33
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,720
obstacle for anyone on the weekend

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,200
trying to lose weight, is happy hour.

35
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,119
Yes. Friday nights, happy hour. They go

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,960
hand in hand. What's a typical Friday

37
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
night happy hour like for you? Oh,

38
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,600
gracious. I want to actually sit down,

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,040
just have a few drinks with my husband,

40
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,560
and just relax. Relax out of the stress

41
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,840
week that I just had. Well, first of

42
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,960
all, I'm glad you're not going out, but

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,960
I'm going to make one little additional

44
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,880
improvement on it. I'm going to analyze

45
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,400
what it is you see, for example, in a

46
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,159
glass of wine. What do you like about

47
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,240
it? You like the act of holding it, the

48
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,520
ritual of massaging it, right? Do I have

49
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,119
it right? Yes, I do. Right. That's what

50
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,040
we like doing, right? And it keeps us

51
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,560
addicted to the process. So, you want

52
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,079
the soothing element of it, but I can't

53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
afford to give you the sugar water,

54
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,520
right? With the alcohol that's in there.

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,479
So, this doesn't have to be painful, but

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,320
we're going to make a little

57
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,079
modification. Take that same type of

58
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
wine glass. Make it a big one. Okay.

59
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
You're going to put some lemon juice.

60
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,960
Just go ahead and squeeze that in there.

61
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,040
Lemon juice. Okay. And then you're going

62
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,399
to add some sparkling water. All right.

63
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,439
I got a little in there already, but add

64
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,880
a little sparkling water. And then put a

65
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,880
little garnish on there. Strawberry just

66
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,479
to jazz it up a tiny bit. Got And I'm

67
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,759
not asking you to compare this to wine,

68
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,200
right? I'm saying to me, there's no

69
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,640
comparison. No, there's no comparison.

70
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,840
But but it's this I is enough to get you

71
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,440
through Friday night. You're going to

72
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,040
reward yourself in a week by looking so

73
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
good when you program. That's what I'm

74
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,680
That's the goal. All right, come on

75
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,080
over. The other thing I want you to do

76
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,480
is think differently about how you

77
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
reward yourself. We always use food to

78
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
reward ourselves for a long week of

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,959
work. You want to enjoy the weekends,

80
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,959
you want to enjoy it with food. Doesn't

81
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,280
have to be that way. This plan calls for

82
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,560
you to detox yourself. The detoxing

83
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,920
isn't just what you put inside your

84
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,280
body. It's what you put around your

85
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,879
body. Definitely. So, I made you a

86
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,640
little bath here. You don't have to get

87
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,239
in, but this bath is going to help you

88
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,440
rid yourself of toxins and it's going to

89
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,360
deal with cravings that you have because

90
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,560
it's a cravings killer. Yes. And so, you

91
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
have a hot water tub, I gather.

92
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,599
Definitely. Yes. So you fill it up with

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,440
warm water and then when it's warm, just

94
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,959
the warmth by itself will allow you to

95
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,319
start sweating. It gets rid of some of

96
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
the toxins. You start to circulate the

97
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,920
lymph in the body, which is how the body

98
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,200
gets rid of garbage in the body, right?

99
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,879
So it likes that. Then you're going to

100
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
add some Epsom salts. Go ahead and add

101
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,040
that in there. Two cups. Sprinkle it in

102
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,040
there. Be dramatic about it. Just thrust

103
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,760
it in there. Yes. Right. It has

104
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,080
magnesium sulfate. Your body absorbs the

105
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,800
magnesium. You're going to use it all.

106
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,800
And then look like this.

107
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,400
Okay. And then if you messes up, your

108
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,720
husband will clean up. So the magnesium

109
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
gets absorbed and so it actually relaxes

110
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,239
your muscles and it relaxes you for that

111
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,920
reason. It's fantastic for sleep. Then

112
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
you're going to add a cup of baking soda

113
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,519
because you actually want to look your

114
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
best and this will help with the skin.

115
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,120
It'll soften your skin. It definitely

116
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,959
does. Oh, you tried. I've tried it.

117
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,400
Perfect. And if you've got dry skin,

118
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
it'll also help with that as well. I

119
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,280
want you to soak in that tub for 30

120
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
minutes. You're giving yourself a gift

121
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,400
without giving yourself any calories or

122
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,239
even temptation of calories. Okay. All

123
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,159
right. So that's Friday night. Now let's

124
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519
go to Saturday. All right. Saturday is

125
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,400
all about And that's a whole day. Yeah,

126
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
it's a whole day. It's the first full

127
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
day of the weekend. So what's your

128
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,040
favorite thing? What you would do

129
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,239
typically do on a Saturday? Casinos. I

130
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,239
don't know. Casinos. Casinos, movies, or

131
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,680
just chilling out. So uh first of all,

132
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,120
I'm I'm I'm happy you're having fun.

133
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,480
Yes. Uh for this weekend, we may not go

134
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,319
to the casinos because there a lot of

135
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
temptation there. I want to give you

136
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,519
three things to do on a Saturday. They

137
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,040
are not going to put any calories into

138
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,560
your body and you're still going to

139
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,159
enjoy them. Great. So I want you to do

140
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,239
things that make you feel good, right?

141
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,360
So, for example, you could stay at home

142
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,799
and just get a facial. Do it yourself.

143
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,239
Okay. Now, I'm gonna have my husband do

144
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,239
it. Yeah. Let him do it. Even better.

145
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,759
It's the least he could do. Absolutely.

146
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,720
Exactly. Okay. Or if you want to get out

147
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,479
a little bit without going to the

148
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
casino, you can get a manicure, a

149
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,720
pedicure, something just to sort of get

150
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,639
you relaxed and feeling good about life.

151
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,600
Pamper yourself a tiny bit. But I think

152
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,440
one of the best things you might want to

153
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,000
do is to organize your life. So, for

154
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,759
example, reevaluate your closet. Yes.

155
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,880
And not just any way you can reevaluate

156
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,639
it, you're going to do with a very clear

157
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,160
purpose. You're going to pick an outfit

158
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,759
that you actually want to get rid of

159
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,440
when you lose the weight. Okay. On the

160
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,400
rapid weight loss plan. And you want to

161
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,080
pick an outfit you're going to be able

162
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,240
to get back into again when you lose the

163
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,320
weight. Yes. Yes. I have that already. I

164
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,479
have my skinny jeans. And every woman

165
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,440
has a pair of skinny jeans. So Oh, there

166
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,280
they are. Look at them. Yes. Oh, no.

167
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,040
Those are my fat clothes. Oh, the fat

168
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,280
clothes. Those are the fat clothes. I'm

169
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,320
burning those as soon as I lose the rest

170
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,440
of my weight. Burning those. Torching

171
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,880
them.

172
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,800
And then you have you already picked out

173
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
those skinny jeans you like. Yes. Yes, I

174
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
have the skinny jeans. I bought them

175
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,080
already. They're folded up nicely. I see

176
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,800
them every single morning. I can tell

177
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,440
you're excited. Very. Okay. All right.

178
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,520
And Saturday night before you go to bed,

179
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,880
we have all these recipes on the Total

180
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,400
10 Plan. Pick the ones you haven't

181
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,840
played with yet. It's, you know, it's

182
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,199
time to do a little bit of evaluation.

183
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
Find some things, some foods you that

184
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,320
you've never tried before. Play with

185
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
them a little bit. Explore options that

186
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,039
you may be able to use during the week

187
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,240
when you're, you know, crazy busy and

188
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,160
can't think about it. We got a

189
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
cauliflower dish. We've got a zucchini

190
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,639
that this, you know, that's a that

191
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,080
actually mimics pasta. It's a copycat.

192
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,600
So, those are nice little ideas for you

193
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
to have. So, takes the opportunity on

194
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,759
Saturday night when you have a little

195
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,280
time. All right. Plus, you won't gain

196
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,039
any weight that way. Okay. The next

197
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,479
obstacle of the weekend is Sunday. This

198
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,479
weekend's a big weekend, you know. Yes.

199
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,720
You got the football playoffs. Got the

200
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,720
Golden Globes. You're all watching.

201
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,400
Football fan. Huge. Now, the best part

202
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,039
about football is probably the food.

203
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,880
Yes. Right. The whole room smells like

204
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,560
it. The house smells like it. Now, the

205
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,479
game plan here, cuz you need one for the

206
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,240
football game, is to actually make a big

207
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,680
bowl of chili. Okay? So, you're going to

208
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,360
do it with a slow cooker. That way, it

209
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
makes the whole house smell nicely.

210
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,960
Okay? And and and you want that comfort

211
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,160
smell around the house, but you're not

212
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
going to put the usual comforts in

213
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
there. You're going to put the foods

214
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,080
that are part of our total 10 rapid

215
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
weight loss plan. So, in this case, I

216
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
got some tomatoes, some beans, ground

217
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,880
turkey, whatever protein you like. This

218
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,080
is optional. You don't have to use this.

219
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
I love the ground turkey, so I'll keep

220
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,039
it. Perfect. But you can make a

221
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,280
vegetarian version as well. Then we have

222
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,880
the onions, the peppers, the celery, and

223
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,199
then all these wonderful spices. Garlic,

224
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,960
cumin, paprika, chili powders, uh, you

225
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
know, a little olive oil. And you put

226
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,759
that all together, salt and pepper to

227
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,319
taste, okay? And you're going to have

228
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,240
this, which not only does it taste

229
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
fantastic, but it will smell fantastic

230
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
for the entire house. And you can enjoy

231
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
it as you wish. You're not going to gain

232
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
weight cuz it's pretty much all the

233
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
foods you can eat unlimited amounts of

234
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,360
in the program. Right. Okay. Now, that's

235
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,720
my warmup. But this is the piesta

236
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
resistance. This is what you're going to

237
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
like. Okay. You're going to make buffalo

238
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,039
cauliflower wings. All right. So, you're

239
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,000
going to marinate cauliflower. You're

240
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,199
going to break it up in little pieces

241
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,080
like this. You're going to marinate it

242
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,319
in hot sauce, lemon, the paprika, and

243
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,919
salt and pepper to desire. And then, of

244
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,599
course, you got to have the blue cheese

245
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,800
saw, right? You got to have that. That's

246
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,919
where the spice is, right? So, you're

247
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
going to replace your normal blue

248
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,560
cheese, which is going to put a ton of

249
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,199
weight in your thighs. It never leaves.

250
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,800
Instead, you're going to take Now, to

251
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,319
get those skinny jeans on, you're going

252
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,639
to get your yogurt. You're gonna add a

253
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,919
little stevia to it, some paprika, some

254
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,440
lemon zest, and a little bit of hot

255
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,400
sauce to taste so it's not too hot for

256
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,919
you. Okay? And then that becomes this.

257
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,919
And please taste that if you like. And I

258
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,280
got to even have the celery there. Take

259
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,360
away the hotness if it's a little too

260
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,199
much for you. Okay. You got to get the

261
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,759
hot sauce. I worked hard on this. Okay.

Okay. Okay. This is your Sunday special.

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,479
