[Applause]

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,520
Are you living every day to its fullest?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,440
A simple question. Or do you feel

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,120
drained like you're sleepwalking through

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,080
life? Well, my next guest says he has a

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,160
plan to awaken you. Epac Chopra is the

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,480
guru who Oprah and Madonna turn to

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,880
today. He's your own personal guide,

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,039
giving you the ultimate personality quiz

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,880
to unleash your infinite potential.

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,880
Please welcome my good friend Deepak

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,880
Chopra.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,800
[Music]

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,239
Thank you.

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,800
[Music]

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,399
Thank you. This is the man I rely on

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,480
when I have deep questions. And I've

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,559
always and I've told everyone this. When

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
I was a a young surgeon, I would stay up

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,559
late at night watching videos you had

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
made just to understand what was deeper

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,760
than what I was facing in the hospital.

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,960
And I'd love if you just give folks a

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160
little bit of an insight into because

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,360
everyone sort of sees, you know, what

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,640
you see is what you get. They think

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,320
about that for themselves, think about

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,840
that for the life around them. But you

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,239
say there's so much more potential.

30
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,480
You've always said this. Yes. We only

31
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,040
see that which you're conditioned to

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,920
see. So when a child is born, the child

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,680
is full of wonder, curiosity,

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,760
uh joy, love, compassion, empathy. And

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,799
then we impose limitations by saying you

36
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,520
are this entity with this name, this

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,640
nationality, this ethnic race, and now

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,640
you're bamboozled into a restricted

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,200
identity when in fact your potential is

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,600
infinite. It's the awareness in which

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
the body and the mind and the world is

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,240
happening all at the same time. Use that

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,960
word awareness. Yes. Is is awareness the

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,240
new word for I don't know mindfulness

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,600
what used to be the phrase that we were

46
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,520
using. Are they the same thing? It's a

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,600
little beyond that because awareness of

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,920
the mind is not the mind. If you're

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,399
aware of a thought then automatically

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,119
you know that I'm not the thought. The

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,280
awareness of this experience is not this

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,079
experience. This is a perceptual

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,280
changing experience. The awareness is

54
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,280
the timeless sear in the midst of time

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,680
bound experiences. What spiritual

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,759
traditions call the soul the timeless

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,599
seer in the midst of the changing

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680
scenery. We're right now in the midst of

59
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,840
the changing scenery and our body and

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,160
our mind is part of the scenery because

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,840
you're aware of this this this and what

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,160
you're thinking all at the same time.

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,160
And we're above that. We are above that.

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
So how aware are you? That's the

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,120
question of today's show. So, we've got

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
a quiz to recognize and realize your

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
infinite potential. So, grab a piece of

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,319
paper or use the the notepad on your

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,760
phone. Just keep track of the answers

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,959
because we're going to give you these

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,560
couple questions and have you count up

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,239
the points at the end. The choices are

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
always going to be never. Now, I never

74
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,599
do this. Sometimes it's true or it's

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,440
always true. Keep track of how many of

76
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,720
each number that you get and we'll give

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,200
you your score at the end. So, first

78
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,920
question, how often do you desire to be

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,599
understood better by others? Three

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,040
points for never, two points sometimes,

81
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,400
one point for always. See, I I actually

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,040
always want to be understood. I'm a

83
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,959
teacher. I I drives me crazy if my kids,

84
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
folks watching the show, frankly, even

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,760
my opponents who don't like what I'm

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
saying, I want them to understand my

87
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,560
point. Yes. But if you're focusing on

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,120
that, then you're not focusing on making

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
them understand your point. So the

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,000
journey is the destination. If I'm

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,800
walking from here to there, if I'm only

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,120
looking there, I'll stumble here. So

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,519
it's question of being in the process

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,920
and being detached from the outcome at

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,319
the same time knowing that the outcome

96
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,560
is guaranteed. If you're studying for an

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,560
exam, then you study. You're not

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,040
thinking about the results all the time.

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,480
Then when do you do the study? Okay,

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,080
next question. Shnie from audi is going

101
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
to help us with this. You ready, Shnie?

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,799
Yes. Deep's going to blow your mind. So,

103
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,440
how often do you sense flawlessness and

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,640
beauty in everything and everyone just

105
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,280
as they are? One point. One point for

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,680
never, two points for sometimes, three

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,480
point for always. Oh, three points for

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,480
always. Always. Um, I believe that

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,200
flawlessness manifested me being here

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,439
today. Today is my birthday and I didn't

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
make plans. Good for you being here.

112
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
Yeah.

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,840
And I'm I happen to be using the

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,439
meditation around abundance that you

115
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,680
have created and I'm on day eight and I

116
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,440
manifested you and this because I

117
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
believe like flawlessness shows up. I

118
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,440
don't have to do much of anything. So

119
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,960
flawless flawlessness

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,360
flows as effortless spontaneity and

121
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,600
synchronicity. It's what the spiritual

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,000
traditions call grace. Some people call

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,520
it good luck and some people call it

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,320
being at the right place at the right

125
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,320
time. meaningful coincidences. This is a

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,560
sign that you're in touch with yourself.

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,919
You're aware of being aware. Oh, sure.

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
You got grace going for you, which is

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,160
always nice. That's it. All right. Next

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
question. How often do you feel that you

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,520
are defending the self-image you hold

132
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,600
about yourself? I'm going to come back

133
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,880
to grace in a second and and soul and

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,880
all these big ideas, but keep track of

135
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,320
your points for now. Please explain this

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,600
question because it's an interesting you

137
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,199
know defending what you're holding on to

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,720
and motiv being motivated by fear and

139
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,800
mistrust are are continuous conflicts.

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,759
If you're constantly defending your

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,160
selfimage you're sacrificing yourself

142
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:19,039
for your selfie. You are not your

143
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:22,000
selfie. This is right now the perceptual

144
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,680
snapshot of your self-image. Who you

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,320
really are is a field of infinite

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,120
possibilities. If you go beyond your

147
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,320
selfimage to your true self, you have

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,800
insight, intuition, creativity, vision,

149
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,680
high consciousness. This is what we all

150
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,919
want. That's unbelievable.

151
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
All right, next question. How often do

152
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,639
you feel your actions are motivated by

153
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,840
fear and mistrust? Fear suggests that

154
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,919
you feel separate from existence,

155
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,800
but there's no way to be separate from

156
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,120
existence. We are part of existence. And

157
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,440
the opposite of fear is of course, as

158
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,960
everybody says, love and compassion and

159
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,160
joy and loss of fear, which allows you

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,319
to tap into the ecosystem that we call

161
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,440
life. When you're connected with life,

162
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,759
your life flourishes. All right, last

163
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,000
question is, how often do you feel truly

164
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,680
alive, filled with vitality? It's

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,600
something we talk about, but you got to

166
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,520
grade yourself now. So, well, I wake up

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,520
every morning with four intentions.

168
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,919
joyful energetic body, loving

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,720
compassionate heart, reflective alert

170
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,240
mind, and lightness of being. If if you

171
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,680
do that, you give yourself three points.

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,800
If you sometimes do what he was talking

173
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,240
about, two points, and if you never

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,600
think about the whole question, it's one

175
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,039
point. So, hope everyone counted their

176
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,120
points up because it's time to reveal

177
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,280
the results. Where do you fall on the

178
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,160
awareness spectrum? If your points added

179
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,680
up to between 12 and 15, you're most

180
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,840
aware of your potential. That's pretty

181
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,240
cool. If your score fell between 8 and

182
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
11, you're more or less in the middle,

183
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,639
right? moderately aware of your

184
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,960
potential. That's sort of where I ended

185
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,400
up. I had 11 points on the scale. And

186
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,080
those of you who score between five and

187
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,199
seven, you're the least aware of your

188
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
potential. So, you got something to do

189
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,919
about it. So, Shaunie, let's bring you

190
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,880
back in again if you don't mind. What

191
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,599
was your overall score? 13. 13. Yes.

192
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,759
Look at that. She manifest everything.

193
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,360
Yes. True grace. All right. For the for

194
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,720
the mere mortals like me and a lot of

195
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,840
the other folks watching now, we're

196
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
going to give you some clues because

197
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,680
coming up, awareness is a new

198
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,520
mindfulness. Deepac's ultimate trick to

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,240
becoming more aware. Stick around.

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,680
Before the break, we gave everyone a

201
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,319
quiz. If you missed it, you can find the

202
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,479
entire quiz on dr.com right this second.

203
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,680
Now, apex says there is a spectrum of

204
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,639
awareness. What does that mean? To be

205
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,240
fully present to experience in the

206
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,960
present moment and also to yourself

207
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,080
is presence which is awareness. It is

208
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,400
the timeless factor in every experience.

209
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,520
So, I'm going to ask you guys, are you

210
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,759
present right now? Yes. Yes. Say it a

211
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,120
little more enthusiastically.

212
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,280
Now I'm going to ask you the same

213
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,400
question, but don't answer it. Are you

214
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,080
present right now?

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,599
Be aware of being aware. Be aware of

216
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,639
that which is listening. So one can at

217
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,599
any moment stop and ask oneself, am I

218
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,000
present? And that's the way you expand

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,199
your awareness. Because if you're not

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,199
present, then your awareness is very

221
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,080
restricted. If you're present, then all

222
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,759
this is happening right now and it's

223
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,240
joyful and there's nothing wrong with

224
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,720
it. The wrongness comes from

225
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,360
anticipation, regrets, memories,

226
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,279
resistance, and that interferes with

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,839
what we call flow, transcendence,

228
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,719
effortless spontaneity. So Debb's a

229
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,719
wonderful new book. It's called

230
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,039
Metahuman: Unleashing Your Infinite

231
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,279
Potential. And he calls this the high

232
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,080
level of selfawareness.

233
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,240
What exactly is a metahuman? Meta means

234
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,519
beyond. Human in this case refers to our

235
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,760
robotic conditioned mind. Everybody is a

236
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,200
bundle of condition reflexes constantly

237
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,560
being triggered by people and

238
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,000
circumstance into stressful outcomes. If

239
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,920
you step back and you can be aware of

240
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,240
yourself, that's the highest

241
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,480
intelligence to observe yourself without

242
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,240
judging yourself. Oh, it's deep stuff.

243
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,320
So Deepax team found that we can improve

244
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,120
your score on the awareness spectrum in

245
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,399
as little as a week of focused mind and

246
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,000
you know your body can improve it

247
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,519
accordingly as well. Yeah, the body is a

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,560
projection. So the test we just took in

249
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,399
the last segment you can actually

250
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,240
improve your skill in not just a little

251
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,600
bit of effort. So there's one thing that

252
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,360
people can start doing right now you

253
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
talk about in the book and has to do

254
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,760
with closing off your ears a little

255
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,120
sensory deprivation. Well you close your

256
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,920
ears sound becomes muffled. You open

257
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,880
them, sound is there again. You are

258
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,360
present as awareness in the sound and in

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,320
the absence of sound and in the wide

260
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,320
range of sounds that are part of every

261
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,080
moment of experience that applies to

262
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,279
every sense. All right, let's just do

263
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,880
sound for a sec. Everyone, if you don't

264
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,320
mind, put your hands before you before

265
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,839
you close your ears off. Keep your hands

266
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,160
there till I take my hands down. It's

267
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,399
fair to do this. Look straight ahead.

268
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,839
Cup your hands over your ears. Right?

269
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,440
And if you just give that two or three

270
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,839
seconds

271
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,640
and put your hands down. Now that

272
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,040
deprivation of sound allowed us to

273
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,920
you'll have better appreciation of sound

274
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,079
if you muffle the sound and experience

275
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,640
it again. Similarly, if you close your

276
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,279
eyes in darkness and then immediately

277
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,120
open them, your visual acuity will

278
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,399
improve. I think is I always thought

279
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,160
because I read the book, I thought there

280
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,079
was also a benefit of allowing yourself

281
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,600
to be free of the distraction of sound.

282
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,520
So for example, one more time, put your

283
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:44,559
hands, make it more challenging.

[Music]

285
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,480
Did any of you notice that loud guitar

286
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,720
playing?

287
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,440
I mean, Sean's worldass musician, but

288
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,760
still it's distracting. And I say, if

289
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,360
you can master the muffling, Deepac, if

290
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
I'm right on this, if you can master the

291
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,800
muffling of the loud stuff that's going

292
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
on in the world, then just to get rid of

293
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,680
some of those distractions, then you can

294
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,120
be much closer to the self-awareness

295
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,880
that you're preaching to us. That's

296
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,279
right. And you can be present to

297
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,200
experience as it happens. And also by

298
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,839
muffling the sound and expanding it

299
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,040
again, you can play with your senses and

300
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,279
you can actually improve your capacity

301
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,880
for sensory experience. Guys, discover a

302
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,959
part of your body, parts of your body

303
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,959
you never thought of before. Thank you

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,800
