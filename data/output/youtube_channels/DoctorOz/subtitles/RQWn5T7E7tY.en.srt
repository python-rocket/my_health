1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,200
You only have one life to live. So

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,440
nothing's more important than feeling as

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,120
young and as vital as possible. But if

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,759
you think you're aging too fast, the

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,679
truth is you have the power to outsmart

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,599
the clock. So let me ask the audience.

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,920
Who feels older than they really are?

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,279
Let me make sure you show

10
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,039
hands. Oh, a couple people here. Let me

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,960
go over here. Who has you had your hand

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,160
up? Take that if you don't mind. How old

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,840
do you feel? You don't have to actually

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,920
tell me how old you truly are, but how

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,920
old do you feel? 27 28.

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,440
That's a good age. I think I love to

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
feel So what what makes you worried

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
about how old you feel versus your true

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,360
age? Well, compared to my age, I would

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
say stress makes me feel older than I am

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,680
and just worrying and the responsibility

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,960
that kicks in after a certain threshold.

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,559
So, right. So, stress and

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,320
responsibility. Perfect. Let me keep

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,760
going. You had your hand up also. Yeah.

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,920
Go ahead. Reluctantly. Yeah. So I think

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,000
it's because of I sit and work all day

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,920
in front of a computer and I I feel like

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,159
my body is aging really fast because of

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,240
that. Okay. So you may not be able to

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,920
control your chronological age. That's

32
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
that's already written in stone. But you

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
can't control your vitality age. So in

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
order to get your vitality age younger

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,320
than your chronological age, you got to

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,520
think differently about what you're

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,119
doing in life. So I want everyone to

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,600
take a look at Camille's story. I'm sure

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,600
a lot of you can relate.

40
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,000
I feel like a 70-year-old trapped in a

41
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,320
51-year-old body.

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,240
I used to have tons of energy, but

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,080
lately I feel like I'm dragging through

44
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,560
life, like the wind's been taken out of

45
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,159
my sail. I'm just like always kind of

46
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,479
sluggish. It's not just my insides that

47
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,320
feel old. I'm starting to feel old on

48
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,360
the

49
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,000
outside. Now, when I look in the mirror,

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,960
I see bags under my eyes, like a little

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,880
sagging. I can't lose weight. I feel

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,320
like my body is working against me. I go

53
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,320
to the gym. I eat right. I try to stay

54
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,520
active. and I walk a lot and I still

55
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,200
feel like my scale is

56
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,119
stuck. I feel like the light went out

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,799
and that I'm not the person that I used

58
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,880
to

59
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,840
be. I really want to enjoy my 50s from

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,160
the inside out.

61
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
Camille, you're describing your body as

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,120
something that's actually working

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,280
against you. Yes. Let me just start to

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,120
feel this change happening in your body.

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,200
About five years ago, I my eldest

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,959
daughter left for college. my mom who

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
lived with me for 20 years and I was her

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,400
caregiver. We moved her to Florida to

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,440
have a better life. And last year my

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,959
youngest is now in college and you go

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,800
from like feeling vibrant and bright to

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,720
like five years ago starting to have the

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,519
candle flicker a little bit and then

74
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,599
this year it's like I'm feeling burnt.

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
Use this word uh candle flickering. This

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,280
phrase interesting one I think a lot of

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,080
people can identify with it. Coming up

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,760
here I want to take you through a little

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,519
voyage. Okay. You like reading books?

80
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,120
Yes, I do. All right. So, I love books.

81
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,000
So, I love everything printed. So, I'm

82
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,000
going to if I can explain your life in

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,640
the form of a book because a lot of us

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,400
look at aging like it's a book. Okay. A

85
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
book about us. So, for example, what do

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,200
books have? They have chapters. So, the

87
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
first chapter in a book usually is our

88
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,120
childhood chapter. Yes. Right. Cute

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
baby, by the way. That is you, right?

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,360
Yes. That's me and my dad. My dad passed

91
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,040
away. I'm sorry. Yeah. 20 years ago. But

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,800
you got mom still. Yes, I do. And I take

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,720
care of her. But this chapter, every

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,080
with mom here is still gone, right?

95
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,440
You're not a child anymore. In fact, you

96
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,720
got to do your own. So, let's flip it

97
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,239
forward. Chapter two for most of us is

98
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,920
our adolescence chapter. We do foolish

99
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,840
things, but we do fun things, things

100
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,840
that give great outfits, by the way. No,

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,440
thank you. Nice little hat there.

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,440
Siling.

103
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,560
So, all these events that we get to

104
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,840
become part of our memories and that's a

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,519
nice thing. Then we want to get on with

106
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
life. We get married. Yes. Right. We

107
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,480
have a marriage chapter and you had a

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,080
great marriage. 25 years.

109
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,760
Congratulations. I'll be 30 years this

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,519
year. Oh, congratulations. So, so best

111
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,040
thing I ever did get married. And for

112
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,720
most of us, we feel that way. sometimes

113
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,319
doesn't work that way as you desire but

114
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
it is a chapter of our life. move on

115
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,000
past that there's a fourth chapter which

116
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,760
is parenthood comes in different people

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
sometimes doesn't happen at all but it's

118
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,480
often there's my girls and then what

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,159
happens then what happens I know then

120
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,480
what's the next the kids are gone and

121
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,000
it's just a big question mark most of us

122
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,480
by this time in our life are only

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,159
halfway through our life yes and yet the

124
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
book is done you haven't filled the rest

125
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,799
of the pages and before we resign

126
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,320
ourselves to old age the truth is we've

127
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,400
got a lot of writing to do a lot of

128
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,079
things things that matter have to fill

129
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,440
the rest of our lives Yes. And that's

130
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,960
why I felt passionately about this

131
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,520
because I think a lot of us forget that

132
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,680
reality. Your kids need you and love

133
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,400
you, but they need you to be there for

134
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,479
yourself. Yes. Not a resign passive, but

135
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,600
actually fulfilled. And the question for

136
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,639
you is what are you going to fill those

137
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,120
pages with? I know. Have you decided?

138
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,680
Um, well, I did get a promotion at work,

139
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,040
so that's a plus. But I'm looking to do

140
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,000
things for myself, you know. Um, I love

141
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
painting. I love dancing and Zumba, so I

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
do that. Yeah. But you like Zumba? Yes.

143
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
I always Zumba. Are you doing it? Yes, I

144
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,040
do it. I like that. That's right. She

145
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,040
does it. I love that. And the reason I

146
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,720
like that so much is because as you

147
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,479
write these chapters, many of which will

148
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,400
have emotional elements, your body has

149
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,000
to be there for you. So, when you say

150
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,680
your body's holding you back from being

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,440
there, well, that's a problem because

152
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
you can't get that back readily. So,

153
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,199
let's combine those issues. I've got a

154
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,720
plan to help stop down aging. It's going

155
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,840
to work. It's also going to work because

156
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
you're going to with by stopping down

157
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
aging of your body, keep your mind

158
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,600
intact. Come on over here. I want you to

159
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,039
meet Caroline Aovian. She's a world

160
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,479
expert in this area. Nice to meet you.

161
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,800
Nice to meet you. How does someone like

162
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,479
Camille get their zest back for life?

163
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,880
So, Camille, you know, we're hearing

164
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,880
about your story. You can't control

165
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,320
everything around you and everything in

166
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,479
your life. But you know what? You can

167
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,280
control your body. And when you

168
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,360
rejuvenate your body, your mind and your

169
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,600
spirit are going to follow. And so, the

170
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,759
plan that we're going to talk about is

171
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,160
going to help your next chapter be a

172
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,520
page turner. And that's what we want.

173
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,880
Good. Thank you. It's not the last

174
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
chapter, it's the next chapter. Many

175
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,720
more to come. We come back has the plan

176
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,320
to stop aging too fast. You won't

177
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
believe the simple changes you can make

178
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,720
in your routine to get you looking and

179
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,479
feeling younger. Stay with us. Camille

180
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,240
says something we can all relate to. She

181
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,919
says she feels like her light went out

182
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,919
inside, like it's just flickering inside

183
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,919
there. To help her and many of you, Dr.

184
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,319
Carolina Povian is back with her plan to

185
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,240
stop aging too fast. Her first step is

186
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,880
to reboot our bodies by incorporating

187
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,080
amino acids into our diet. Why are they

188
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
important and which ones do you have to

189
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,120
focus on? So amino acids are the

190
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,560
building blocks of our bodies. The three

191
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,560
most important are right here. So I'm

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,280
going to build these for you. So

193
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,919
leucine, arginine, and glutamine. Guess

194
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,240
what? They spell out lag. So you can

195
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,160
remember because if you're lagging, it

196
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,080
means you need more of these, right?

197
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
Leine, arginine, glutamine. Forget about

198
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,960
the names. You know why? Because they're

199
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,680
in the foods that we can find every day.

200
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,240
And here they are. She's like Carol

201
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,479
Merrill over there reveals. So when you

202
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
lag, that means you need more protein,

203
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,800
more amino acids. We find these in eggs.

204
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,160
Eggs are wonderful things. They're

205
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,120
they're building blocks. Low-fat dairy,

206
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,039
milk, cheese, and yogurt, but even

207
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,120
animal protein, shrimp, meat, fish, and

208
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,520
you know what the hero here is? Turkey.

209
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,000
Turkey has a lot of arginine and also a

210
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,240
lot of stuff that helps us with sleep,

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,560
which we'll talk about next. But if

212
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,599
you're a vegetarian, you find these

213
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,479
amino acids in soybeans and lentils and

214
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,960
other legumes. So, make sure you get a

215
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,960
lot of these during the day, hopefully

216
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,720
at each meal to prevent lag. Okay. All

217
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
right. Next up, we're gonna revitalize a

218
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,639
routine for brain health. So, Dr.

219
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,160
Pobian, how does this help? So, your

220
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,960
brain very important. So as you're going

221
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,520
through your life, if you have a routine

222
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,319
and it's predictable, guess what? Life

223
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,560
gets very boring. Okay? So you say you

224
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,000
like to dance, Zumba,

225
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,319
painting, do it. You know why? Because

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,720
your neurons will regenerate because it

227
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,360
when you do new things, it makes new

228
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,080
connections and you feel wonderful. You

229
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,160
feel a zest for life again. Make that

230
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,120
chapter a page turner. your next

231
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,400
chapter. Make it wild and crazy. And we

232
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
talked about sleep earlier, but let me

233
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,639
just finish on this. We want you to

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,759
actually schedule your stress because if

235
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,120
you don't do that, you're not going to

236
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
be able to get the sleep that you need.

237
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
Dr. Pov, it sounds very

238
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
counterintuitive. How do you schedule

239
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,080
stress? Well, do you sleep enough and

240
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,240
No, I What happens? I wake up like three

241
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,639
times a night, you know, worrying about

242
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,680
everything about work, my children, my

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,520
mother. So when you're worried about

244
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,840
this at 3:00 in the morning, is it going

245
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,680
to help to work? You know what? You need

246
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,479
your sleep. You need 7 to eight hours of

247
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,959
sleep a night because your cells need to

248
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,200
rejuvenate and sleep is very important.

249
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,039
It's very restful. Gets you back going.

250
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,519
So what are you going to do whenever

251
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,800
you're worried at you find yourself in

252
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,600
the middle of night worrying about

253
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,920
everything? Schedule a time to stress

254
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,680
about it. Not when you're sleeping.

255
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,120
Stop. Okay, maybe write it down. Okay,

256
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm going to do I'm going to think about

257
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,000
this tomorrow when I have rested and

258
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,160
that would be a great way to try to get

259
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,440
that 7 to eight hours of sleep a night.

260
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,800
That would be nice. It would be

261
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,839
wonderful for everybody. Thank you for
