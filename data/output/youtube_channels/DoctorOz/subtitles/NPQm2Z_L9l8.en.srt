00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,759
Today, a true crime mystery. What

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,080
happened to Ada Shabbani? Just days

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,320
before her birthday, the 25-year-old

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,480
aspiring actress disappeared from her

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,480
Hollywood home, leaving behind very few

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,440
clues and sending her family and

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,640
community into panic. The full story has

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,720
never been told. Now, one team has set

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,160
out to uncover the truth behind this

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,080
mystery. And they're choosing to

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,720
publicize their investigation in real

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,720
time, even if it risks their lives.

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,399
Joining me now is journalist and podcast

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,640
host Neil Strauss and private

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,760
investigator Jaden Brandt. Jaden was

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,360
hired by the Shabbani family. Neil is a

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,440
well-known writer for the New York Times

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,920
and Rolling Stone. I thank you both for

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
being here. Neil, I mean, journalists

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,039
get threats, but you've had threats

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,719
against your life. Have you ever thought

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,120
this might not be the best move? Maybe

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,640
we should back up a tiny bit. Uh, I've

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,559
definitely been threatened before, and I

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
guess my first response was fear because

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,399
I have a four-year-old. Second response

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,399
was regret. But then you realize if

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,840
someone is threatening you, it's most

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,720
often coming from a position of

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,320
weakness. Yeah. So I realized that I was

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,520
probably close to the truth because

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,159
otherwise why would they be trying to

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,080
stop me? Jaden. Jaden, what were you and

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,360
the family facing as you tried to

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,720
uncover what had happened to their

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,840
daughter, especially because there

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,240
weren't a lot of clues at the beginning

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,080
of ADA's case. Right. So yeah, I think

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,320
as in all missing person's cases, you

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,200
know, one of the challenges initially is

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,439
u with a day of being an adult, um you

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,240
know, there's limited resources that the

43
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,400
local police departments um can expend

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,320
to handle these cases. So reports are

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,079
taken, but generally as an adult,

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,680
they're taken um you know, as a

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,680
voluntary missing and they're kind of

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,960
categorized that way. So a lot of times

49
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,799
the families look to us as private

50
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,119
investigators to um try to supplement

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,159
that investigation. And so we often try

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,799
to um try to determine whether or not

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,880
they were voluntary or involuntary. Um

54
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,119
if we start to see that there may be

55
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,840
foul play involved, we we try to develop

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,159
that evidence and and get that to the

57
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,240
local police department so that they can

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,159
move the case status to something where

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,200
they can get more resources. And what's

60
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,360
interesting because I learned it during

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
this this is really like I normally

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,319
write about entertainment for Rolling

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,319
Stone. Oh my goodness. So So I didn't

64
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,840
know till I did this that there 3,900

65
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,319
people. So, if you go to the LAPD, the

66
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,160
LA police website, it says 3,900 people

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,920
go missing every year. So, if you have a

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,840
loved one who goes missing, it says

69
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,520
they'll probably show up. If they don't

70
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,280
show up, a police officer will take a

71
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,280
report. But they can't take it that

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,280
seriously because it's not proven as a

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,879
homicide. They said if you still can't

74
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,800
find them, you should hire a private

75
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,160
investigator. Well, they tell you, they

76
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,519
tell you that on their website. This is

77
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,360
not like They literally say that on

78
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,720
their website. It's shocking. And then

79
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,239
they said if you can't afford a private

80
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
investigator, because guys like Jaden

81
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,239
are expensive probably. um that uh then

82
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
you should go to the Salvation Army. It

83
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,879
says that on their website. The

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
Salvation Army? Yeah, cuz I guess they

85
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,959
have some kind of service, volunteer

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
service. But that's the procedure cuz so

87
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,720
many people go missing and because

88
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
there's no body, they can't say it's a

89
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,319
homicide. I never knew the Salvation

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,760
Army deputized private investigators,

91
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,879
but you know, they I always supported

92
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,280
them. I thought they were great group,

93
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,840
but it just shows I get the the larger

94
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,519
point. Big cities, the police can't keep

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,200
up. Exactly. And I know we don't solve

96
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,200
probably half the murders. Right. Right.

97
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,640
So, it's probably worth hiring someone

98
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,480
early on. So, here you are. You're

99
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,920
hired. You're professional. Um, you

100
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,959
start to develop the case a little bit.

101
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,280
How are you able to uncover new leads?

102
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,680
Well, I think initially, um, what we do

103
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,599
is is try to get out and and and hit

104
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,760
everything as fast as we can because

105
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,879
it's very timesensitive. So, we start

106
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,720
talking to friends, family, um anyone

107
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
that's involved in their life to try and

108
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,680
figure out and and try to piece together

109
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,920
um kind of what their life looked like

110
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,920
at the time that they disappeared, try

111
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,920
to parse through that and and you know,

112
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,480
try to find that that clue or that

113
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,560
thread that we can pull to to give us a

114
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,400
direction to go because because people I

115
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
I I can't stress this enough because as

116
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,799
I'm doing more, I'm seeing the same

117
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,239
mistakes happen over and over as a

118
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,519
pattern, which is you want to wait for

119
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,040
them to show up and then you want to

120
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,640
wait for the police to do their

121
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,000
And maybe that by that time a week or

122
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,080
two weeks have passed and all the

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,760
security footage has started to expire.

124
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,959
So you miss maybe that crucial the bus

125
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,040
that was driving by because their

126
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,400
cameras roll over every 24 hours. That

127
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
maybe convenience store and maybe that

128
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,680
expires after a month and you start to

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,720
lose these pieces of information and you

130
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
may never know what happened if you

131
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,239
don't move fast. So you guys got on to

132
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
it pretty quickly. How did you begin to

133
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,560
tease out what was happening in Ada's

134
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
life right before she disappeared? Yeah.

135
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
Yeah. Yeah, I think I think the first

136
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,280
the first steps were I mean you talk to

137
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
everybody in her her life, her friends,

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,479
her friends are friends, you go through

139
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,800
photo, you go through their your

140
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,560
computer, her phone, uh you know,

141
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,040
iCloud, all that data and you can start

142
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,520
to really piece together like an exact

143
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,040
series of steps until she goes off the

144
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,800
grid. So, at the beginning of this

145
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
investigation, Neil and Jaden had very

146
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,880
little to work with. They retrace Ada's

147
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
last steps and digital activity. I'm

148
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,880
going to walk you through what they

149
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,720
found. On February 23rd, 2018, she

150
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,199
actually leaves the apartment and she

151
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
goes to her local favorite coffee shop,

152
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,840
right? And these are all the little

153
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
pieces I put together. So, we'll start

154
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,840
off at the very beginning. First clue,

155
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,120
coffee shop. It's called Rise and Grind.

156
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,080
It was a pretty much of a habit. She

157
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,280
would go there. Yeah. I was at the

158
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,360
corner from her apartment and you knew

159
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,440
she was there. Yes. Okay. So, this is

160
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,680
again February 23rd. Now, let's go

161
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,400
forward a couple hours. It's now 12:21

162
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,800
that day. YouTube history data shows her

163
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,479
listening to music. So, now they can

164
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,560
place her. At least someone's using her

165
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,080
device if she's not. Right? Plays the

166
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,720
last song at around 12:48, which 20

167
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,000
minutes later, right? Typical for us to

168
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
do that. Listen for a couple minutes.

169
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,039
Right? Right after that, two minutes

170
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,440
later, was the last time her phone was

171
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,440
used that

172
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,600
afternoon. And then fast forward 12

173
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,960
hours later, right, the computer is

174
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,360
powered on from inside of her home. Now,

175
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,520
this is more than 12 hours after her

176
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,280
phone activity stopped. and she was a

177
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
pretty frequent social media user. So

178
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,560
Jaden, why is this significant? Well, I

179
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,720
mean that tells us that um you know

180
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,560
based on her phone usage, I mean she she

181
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,199
was always on her phone. That tells us

182
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,280
that it may not have been her that was

183
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,080
using the computer that night. That

184
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,479
coupled with the fact that when LAPD

185
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,800
first went to her apartment, her door

186
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,160
was left unlocked. It was unlocked.

187
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
Correct. All right. So let's go to that

188
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,199
ballpoint. Now you also again the police

189
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,120
are reporting this. So now we have

190
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,479
pretty good evidence. Again, later in

191
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,479
that same day, a few hours later, but

192
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,120
now it's daytime, front doors unlocked,

193
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,639
no signs of a struggle. And this is the

194
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,919
crazy thing. Can we have a seat here?

195
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,639
The last text was sent around that

196
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,600
period. And it's asking, "Where are the

197
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,120
red candles?" That's the clue. Where are

198
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,280
the red candles? So Neil, who was that

199
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,639
text sent to? Uh she was uh in an acting

200
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,400
school. She sent that text to a friend

201
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,919
from acting school saying, "Yeah, do you

202
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,840
know where I can get red candles?" And

203
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,080
at the time that was one of the first

204
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,880
kind of mysteries and clues. All right.

205
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,240
So keep that in your mind. Red candles.

206
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,360
You you did some homework on people

207
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
around here. A lot of personal

208
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
interviews. Who stands out? Who caught

209
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,600
your attention? Well, so after talking

210
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,800
to friends, family, uh other students at

211
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,039
the acting school. Um one name it just

212
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,800
kept coming up. Um and that was Chris

213
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,240
Spots. Um he was an on-again off-again

214
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,680
boyfriend, fellow student at the acting

215
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,599
school. Um, and you know, we were

216
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,919
getting a lot of lot of information

217
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,479
about him, a lot of misinformation about

218
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,960
him, and um, we knew that he was

219
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,800
somebody that we needed to talk to. All

220
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,800
right. Up next, the investigation proved

221
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
to be far from easy, and startling

222
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,360
discoveries would place Neil and Jaden

223
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,720
in a web of lies. Don't go away. Hey,

224
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,479
just wanted to give you an update. Just

225
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,919
got a call from Angel. He just got a

226
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,440
call that came in on his cell phone.

227
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,919
Basically, he got a call from a guy

228
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,599
anonymous, didn't leave a name, you

229
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,840
know, a block number, saying that he saw

230
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,240
a

231
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:52,960
DEA and she was being like put

232
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,599
into the bed of a pickup truck out in

233
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
front of her

234
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,120
apartment. She He said that she was like

235
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,000
out of it, like the implication was like

236
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,520
maybe drugged. And then this truck took

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,759
off and drove south down toward

238
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
Hollywood

239
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,800
Boulevard. He gives us a description of

240
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,919
the

241
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,440
truck and he even has the plate number.

242
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,280
We're back with journalist Neil Strauss

243
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,039
and private investigator Jaden Brandt

244
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,120
who have been on the hunt to figure out

245
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,919
what happened to 25-year-old aspiring

246
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840
actress Ada Shabbani. After conducting

247
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,360
several interviews, they got tips like

248
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,599
the ones you just heard and they began

249
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,879
coming in these tips. So Neil, that's a

250
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,000
message that Jaden sent to you. What

251
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,280
were your thoughts as you began

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,880
processing? It's pretty It's a

253
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,680
blockbuster idea. Yeah. I mean, your

254
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,599
first thoughts when you hear this

255
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,200
message is there no leads, no real

256
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,640
suspects yet, and all of a sudden

257
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,320
there's the entire case and what

258
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,880
happened being delivered right there.

259
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,880
So, I thought we got it. This is it. But

260
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,120
that turned out not to be the case. So,

261
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,600
who owned that truck, Jaden? Well, so

262
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,839
yeah, that that that was a big tip. So,

263
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,360
uh we ran the license plate uh and we

264
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,720
actually Does law enforcement do that

265
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,839
for you? Can you do that outside of law

266
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
enforcement? Uh, no. Private

267
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,600
investigators have access to to that

268
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,240
type of information. Okay. licensed

269
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,480
investigators do. Yes. Okay. So, um we

270
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,360
ran the plate and we found that it came

271
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,839
back to Chris Spots who was again the on

272
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,080
and off again boyfriend, the acting

273
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:16,240
student. Um we got an address off of

274
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,360
that registration. Ended up not being

275
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,120
the address. Um and um we started

276
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,279
looking into some other possible

277
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,120
addresses where he may be and and really

278
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,399
the the hunt was on at that point. Can

279
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,000
you give us a little bit of background

280
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,920
on Ada? Who was he? What was she doing?

281
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,680
and and her relationship with Chris

282
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,279
spots. Yeah, I think I think it's really

283
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,600
important to mention because Ada is born

284
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,800
in Macedonia. She's Al Albanian and

285
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,640
really is one of those people who just

286
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,320
always had that special quality about

287
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,480
her. You can even find early videos of

288
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,080
her baby dancing on YouTube. Like she is

289
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,080
a star. She just radiates. She's on

290
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,080
stage. She always knew she was too big

291
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,680
for the town she was born in. So like so

292
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,320
many people with a dream, she wanted to

293
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,160
come to LA and be an actress and a star.

294
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,760
But unlike many of those people, she

295
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,200
really wanted to work at it, right? She

296
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,120
went to the Stella Adler Academy of

297
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,040
Acting, uh, which is one of the most

298
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,200
prestigious and serious acting schools,

299
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,040
and that's where she met Chris Spots.

300
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,040
He's a couple years older, a senior

301
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,640
student. Uh, and he's an actor, too.

302
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,880
He's an actor, too. Oh, yeah. Right. So,

303
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,839
they're dating. So, so yeah, they're do

304
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,279
a scene together. They're rehearsing

305
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
back at her apartment, and they start

306
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,040
dating. Got it. So, now this is, you

307
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,800
know, this intrigue gets a little

308
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,240
thicker. Yeah. So, the next tip that

309
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,000
came in that sort of got you moving in

310
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,120
the right direction. There's probably

311
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,839
one more piece of backtory I should give

312
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,120
you. Please. He has a fiance. He's a

313
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,040
fiance. He has a fiance. So, we

314
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,720
discovered that that he had a fiance.

315
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,480
All right. So, what's what's your next

316
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,160
move now? You've got a tip that his

317
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
license plate, his truck was in front of

318
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,760
her house. Someone just said that she

319
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
was carted out on it. You know that they

320
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,200
were dating, but he's got a fiance. So,

321
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,920
that complicates issues. Now, where do

322
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,519
you go? Um, well, at this point, at this

323
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,600
point, I wanted to investigate

324
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,600
everything I could about Chris Spots.

325
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,440
But at the same time, here's the thing

326
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,240
you learn from journalism and writing is

327
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,000
you can't trust anything you most things

328
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,399
you read and most things you hear unless

329
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,240
they're firsthand. So, this tip came

330
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,600
from an anonymous tipster to one of

331
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,800
Ada's friends who was running the tip

332
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,800
line to Jaden to me. So, before I just

333
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,560
take this at face value, I wanted to go

334
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
find this person. So, I found out who

335
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,839
they were. I waited outside their

336
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,640
apartment. They walked outside. I said I

337
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,079
told them what I was doing. I said,

338
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,200
"Could I talk to you?" They were a

339
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,640
little casy. They agreed to do

340
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,920
anonymously anonymously. They pulled me

341
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,600
into a parking garage, which I probably

342
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,640
shouldn't have done if I was smarter. Uh

343
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,760
they pulled me into the parking garage

344
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,680
and they said a completely different

345
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,680
story. They said that Ada wasn't

346
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,600
drugged. She wasn't forced into the

347
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,880
truck, but she was being taken out of

348
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,000
the apartment in the in the bed of a

349
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,279
truck hiding from somebody else. Oh. And

350
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
so that's when all of a sudden, and by

351
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,720
the way, every news report you read will

352
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
say was drugged and put in the back of

353
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,040
the truck. And that's not what happened.

354
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,240
It just reinforces how misleading much

355
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,519
of what we read is these days. But this

356
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,680
is actually legitimate journalists

357
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,959
writing the wrong thing. Right. So if I

358
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,240
can just talk a little I made about a

359
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,240
medical observation I made about a lot

360
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,800
of these true crime shows. This thing

361
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,399
called false memory syndrome and it's a

362
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,839
condition where a person centers a

363
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,839
memory on a significant experience an

364
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,920
emotional experience that could but the

365
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
experience happens to be false. It never

366
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,959
happened. Yeah. And I study I so I

367
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
studied this for the podcast because I

368
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,560
was fascinated because here's what

369
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,480
happened. The tipster's tip was also

370
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,240
wrong because Jaden got a hold of

371
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
footage. I'm sorry. What you just told

372
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,959
me was a clarification. It was wrong,

373
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,000
too. That was wrong, too. That's what's

374
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,360
crazy about this. That's why these

375
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,800
things are so hard to investigate. But

376
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,519
it's fascinating to just dig in and get

377
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,480
to the truth. So, he had false memory.

378
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,839
Yeah. And I'll tell you I'll tell you

379
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,680
how that I'll tell you how that worked

380
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
cuz I became fascinated by it because

381
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,560
this person was sure he saw a day in the

382
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,160
truck. What happened is that had

383
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,079
happened a few days earlier and he

384
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
conflated the two events. So I went to

385
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,600
this the University of Colona just to

386
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,959
kind of research this and they're doing

387
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,399
studies on false memory. So what I used

388
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,480
to think right is that I thought just

389
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
your memory is just a recording device

390
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,440
in your unconscious mind. That's what I

391
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
thought it was. I didn't know. I thought

392
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,200
they're all stored but that's not what

393
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,639
happens. You know it's it's like the

394
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,160
neuron every time you access a memory

395
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,680
the neurology kind of changes. So

396
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,800
they're doing a study. They're getting

397
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,880
people anyone who 17 people who college

398
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
students saying who were never arrested

399
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
never had problems with the police. They

400
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,680
were convincing them over the course of

401
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,800
three interviews, making them remember

402
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
something that wasn't true, which is

403
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,680
that they had been arrested by the

404
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
police and had a fight. They were

405
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,040
implanting false memories over the

406
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,040
course of three maybe hourlong

407
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,279
interviews and everybody was going for

408
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,440
it. Oh my goodness. It's it just changed

409
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,040
the way I think about everything. Well,

410
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,040
that of course because then now you do

411
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
these interviews and if you keep asking

412
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,000
enough questions the right way, you

413
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,360
could purposely convince people that

414
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,959
they're guilty or not. And it gets

415
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,600
locked in. And they did studies too.

416
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,079
They ask you ask somebody you know uh at

417
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,440
what uh speed was the car going during

418
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,880
the accident they'll say one speed. If

419
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,399
you say how fast was the car speeding

420
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,600
during the accident they'll say a faster

421
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,279
speed. Be careful guys now that you

422
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,800
understand how this works. People can

423
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,639
manipulate your mind and that'll save a

424
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,320
lot of relationships because your both

425
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,440
memories are true to you. It may not be

426
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,360
what happened. All right. So Chris was I

427
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,360
know not as easy to access Jaden early

428
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
in this investigation when police

429
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
finally did catch up to him. What was he

430
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,000
saying?

431
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,079
Well, uh, you know, yeah, Chris was

432
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,399
Chris was not easy to to get in contact

433
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,880
with, uh, at this time. You know, he

434
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,880
was, um, he was telling all kinds of

435
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,000
different stories. Um, he had told some

436
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,440
some friends that, um, him and Ada had

437
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
gotten in an argument. They had broken

438
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,680
up and he had left the apartment. Um, he

439
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,279
told, um, another group of friends that,

440
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,120
uh, he took her up to Magic Mountain and

441
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,880
dropped her off after an argument. He

442
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,320
actually told his attorney that as well.

443
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,920
That was a statement that was given to

444
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,839
us. And um Ada communicated to her

445
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
friends that he had told her that they

446
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,199
were going on a trip because uh his

447
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,079
uncle had died and they were going to a

448
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,760
funeral up in Northern California. So he

449
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,600
he he had proved to be pretty hard to

450
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,760
get in contact with. He was bouncing

451
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,519
between hotels in Los Angeles and

452
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,680
between a family home in Colorado as

453
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,000
well. So I'm just putting this together

454
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,279
my myself. First off, this issue about

455
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,760
the funeral, is that what the red

456
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,639
candles were about? Yes. So, good. Good

457
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,320
job, by the way. I was gonna point that

458
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
out. Yeah. The red candles were for the

459
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,240
funeral of uh Kristen's uncle. So, she

460
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,160
wanted them for the funeral. So, she

461
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,560
thought she was going to a to a funeral.

462
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,240
Exactly. And then this false memory show

463
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,720
caught up on this. So, we have one

464
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,079
person falsely saying that an eyewitness

465
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,760
saw her being pulled out when she was

466
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,040
drugged. The person who got to the

467
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,639
primary witness said, "No, no, that's

468
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,199
not what happened. She was put into the

469
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,360
back to hide." And then the videotape,

470
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,519
the videotape shows the truth. The

471
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,519
truth, which is she is leaving very

472
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,720
amically with her boyfriend, getting the

473
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,760
passenger seat of his car with a

474
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,040
suitcase. And you don't take a suitcase

475
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,440
to Magic Mountain because it's only an

476
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,360
hour away from LA, right? So, she

477
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
thought she was going somewhere, right?

478
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,959
And she was looking for red candles,

479
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,639
right? All right. Jane and Neil were

480
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,839
able to uncover deleted footage from

481
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,160
Ada's iCloud account. Take a look. I'm

482
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,320
not recording anymore beef out of my

483
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,320
truck. You have beat me up. Get out of

484
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,160
my truck. You have beat me up. You've

485
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,120
taken my Rolex. You took my Rolex. You

486
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,720
took my Rolex. You beat me up.

487
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,959
Everything hurt. Just get out of my

488
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,959
truck. I'm not getting out till I get my

489
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,360
Rolex. I'll go upstairs and get your

490
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,560
Rolex

491
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,120
in. I'll go upstairs and get your Rolex.

492
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,639
It's on the same place you left it.

493
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,680
Please get out of my truck. You have my

494
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,040
Rolex and my keys and my iPhone. No. My

495
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,360
second iPhone. Yes, you have it. Yes,

496
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,120
even my find my iPhone shows me the

497
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,880
address of your place. Do you think I

498
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,399
have it in my house? Show me it. Show

499
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,759
me. Open up your iPhone, please. Let's

500
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,120
look for your iPhone. Open up your

501
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,639
iPhone. Let's see what The battery is

502
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,759
dead. You just said when you open up

503
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,240
your phone, the battery is dead. I'm

504
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,240
going to call the police.

505
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,720
Up next, the search for Ada intensifies.

506
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,639
Investigators get a lead of where she

507
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,800
might be, but will she still be alive?

508
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,279
Plus, a high-speed chase with a twist

509
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,959
that no one saw coming. Stay with us.

510
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,360
We're back with journalist Neil Strauss

511
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,800
and private investigator Jaden Brandt.

512
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,639
So, less than a month into their

513
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,199
investigation of the missing 25-year-old

514
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,759
aspiring actress Ada Shabbani, they

515
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,360
finally find her boyfriend Chris Spots.

516
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,240
So, what happens when police finally

517
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,199
caught up with them? Um, so Chris was uh

518
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,959
returning to Los Angeles from Colorado.

519
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:13,520
Um, police uh located his uh Toyota

520
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,839
Tacoma truck. That was the truck we saw

521
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,120
Ada in the back of. Correct. same one

522
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,679
that had pulled out in front of the

523
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,039
house that everyone got wrong. But yes,

524
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,720
correct. It was his truck. She just was

525
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,959
in the back. Back truck. Same truck. All

526
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,799
right. Yeah. So, police located his

527
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,240
truck um and he led them on a on a

528
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:33,520
pursuit and uh at the end of that

529
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,520
pursuit um he pulled over and fatally

530
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,400
shot himself.

531
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,400
He committed suicide. Yes.

532
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,679
and and and not not only so this is

533
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,799
where the it's it's the it's the sad

534
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,200
it's a saddest story because you know he

535
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,640
he may I thought maybe this secret if

536
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,280
he's the one who's responsible was gone

537
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,400
with him. So I did some research and I

538
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,320
found out there was someone in the car

539
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,039
with him. This person hasn't been named.

540
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,559
I tracked them down. I talked to him. He

541
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,080
said that here's what here's what Chris

542
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,960
was planning. Chris was planning on

543
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,039
taking his own life. But before doing it

544
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,720
he wanted to go uh he was an actor. He

545
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,000
wanted to go to he had a part in LA. He

546
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,760
wanted to do an acting job and show the

547
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,120
world what he could do as an actor. And

548
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,840
then the pair of them, Chris and his

549
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,120
friend, had two guns in the car. I just

550
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,440
get the chills I'm saying this gets so

551
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,400
crazy. Had two guns. They had a rope and

552
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,360
a tape recorder. And they're going to go

553
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,400
confront Chris's father because Chris

554
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,679
said they were prepared to torture, tie

555
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,760
up, torture Chris's father because Chris

556
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,160
said his father had done it and his

557
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,000
father knows where Ada is and he was

558
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,280
prepared to even kill his own father.

559
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,600
And what had his father done? Well, what

560
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,440
Chris believed Chris believed and was

561
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,039
tell telling his friend Chance and uh

562
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,120
and uh that his father was the one who

563
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,200
who' done it. His father had a a bad

564
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,360
history and that his Chris believed his

565
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,320
father was responsible responsible for

566
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,200
Ada's disappearance. Okay. And what

567
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,960
happened to Ada? Did she turn up? Uh so

568
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:04,160
yeah, five days um after Chris committed

569
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,480
suicide, um Ada's body was located in a

570
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,760
shallow grave uh about 45 minutes

571
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,840
outside of Sacramento, California.

572
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,559
It's so I mean it's so it's just so it's

573
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,320
just I just it's again I'm new to this,

574
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,679
but it's like from everything there's

575
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,440
just there are two people who don't need

576
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,720
to be gone. There's even with motives we

577
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,000
have and what we know there's just no

578
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,240
there's no no good reason. Do we know if

579
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,400
there was a connection to between Chris

580
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,880
and a day's death?

581
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,600
Um, what we can't what we what we can

582
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,760
say is

583
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,720
that so here's what's wild is this is

584
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,840
still being investigated as what

585
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,080
happened, right? The podcast is

586
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,760
literally ongoing in real time. So

587
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,679
there's a lot of answers coming and I'm

588
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,520
trying to nail them all down before I

589
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,039
present them. And literally two nights

590
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,080
ago I was on the phone with Chris's

591
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,200
father for two hours. So I'm literally

592
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,960
like we're really in a process right

593
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,960
here. This isn't a cold case that we

594
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,320
went back to. This is literally ongoing.

595
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,520
So, we're we're wrapping this up and

596
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,960
we're nailing down the final things.

597
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,640
That's why it's so almost uncomfortable

598
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,720
to even be on here talking about it.

599
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,840
Well, I appreciate you coming. Yeah. On

600
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,000
the other hand, often times on this

601
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,600
show, we are doing autopsies of what

602
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
happened. Right. Right. It's looking

603
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,120
back at what went wrong. Being in the

604
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,280
middle of it, I understand all the

605
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,280
questions. I had no idea that so much of

606
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,080
the burden of solving the crimes in our

607
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,679
communities is up to us. Yeah. And I

608
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,200
appreciate that we don't know yet what

609
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,280
happened to Ada. Obviously, her death is

610
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,360
terribly unfortunate. Chris is most

611
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,720
likely is as well. And I try to put

612
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,520
these pieces together in my own mind.

613
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,960
And I I pay you tribute for keeping it

614
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,640
all straight and going one step beyond

615
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,120
where normal law enforcement goes

616
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,120
because it opens our eyes to it. It's

617
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,600
still an open uh case. You have hope

618
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,520
that we will one day know the answer of

619
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,760
what happened to Ada. Yeah. I I can tell

620
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,440
you because of the data we've recovered

621
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,120
and picked up that we're going to have a

622
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,640
very very clear idea of what happened.

623
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,960
These things never make sense. Both it's

624
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,799
interesting because both families are

625
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
are suffering, her family, Chris's

626
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,360
family, and they really just want

627
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,039
answers in the truth, whatever those may

628
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,480
be. So, it's really a there is a burden

629
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,080
on that. The police want to close it

630
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,000
close an investigation or close a case,

631
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,039
but a family wants just answers and and

632
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,640
closure, and that's what we're trying to

633
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,159
get. All right. Thank you very much for
