00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,160
Wipe on, wipe off. Just how many germs

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,839
are you really getting rid of? You're

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,679
going to be so stunned. We've got the

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,679
dirty truth on disinfectant wipes.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,720
And I investigate disposable wipes. Wish

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,400
you guys would smell this right now.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,240
They may be flushed, but they're not

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,520
forgotten. They're not decomposible.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,080
Correct. And that's causing us big

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,370
issues. Plus, just how safe is your home

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,569

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,440
Today, we are testing all the wipes that

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,199
have become a sanitary staple in our

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,199
house. From the ones you use on your

21
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
body to the disinfecting wipes you clean

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,960
with. So, in the name of science, we're

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,199
going to make the ultimate mess to find

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,719
out how well these wipes work to get rid

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,559
of germs. Come on, Kisia. Come on,

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,000
honey. Come on. We'll go to the kitchen.

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,000
We'll cut up some raw chicken. We'll

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
even

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,799
sneeze on countertops. We're going to

30
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,720
make the ultimate mess.

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,320
Don't worry, I'm not going to tell Lisa.

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,320
Lisa is not going to know that you did

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,799
this or me.

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,479
We are still making a big mess over in

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,240
our germ lab because today we're

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,320
investigating the dirty truth about

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,000
disinfecting wipes. Almost all of us

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,520
trust these wipes to keep our house

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
clean from the nasty germs that are

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,880
being passed around this time of year.

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,960
But how many germs are you really

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,720
getting rid of with one wipe? To help

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,360
reveal what we've uncovered is emergency

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,880
room physician Dr. Samson Davis back

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
with all the insights. Thanks for being

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,720
here. Thank you. Thank you. So, these

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,159
disinfecting wipes aren't just being

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,280
used in homes. They're in gyms, right?

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,040
Right? They're in grocery stores. Every

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,040
in hospitals we have to use them

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
frequently. And how many of you be

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,360
honest? Take it out. It's so convenient.

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,119
Right. Quick little wipe down here. You

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,280
toss it. Right. Hands up. How many do

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,799
that? Right. Most people. That's what I

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,399
did until today. But Dr. Samson, you

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,239
have informed me that we're doing it all

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
wrong. At least most of us are. Yeah. It

59
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,000
seems simple, right? You figure you wipe

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,760
the areas clean, but cleaning the

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
surface area and disinfecting the

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,040
surface areas is totally two different

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
things. So, it's important to read the

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,920
label to see how long the surface area

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,680
must remain wet or moisturized by the

66
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,280
disinfectant wipe. If you just simply

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
clean it, you may be spreading the

68
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,800
bacteria and the germs versus

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,680
disinfecting the surface. So, it's a

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,040
difference between cleaning and

71
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,800
disinfecting. Can you imagine that,

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,000
guys? You're going to be so stunned when

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,599
we're done today cuz we're going to

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,280
share with all the But first, let's get

75
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,319
into what's in these wipes. Talking

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,680
about the biggest mistakes uh today, but

77
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,280
let's start off with what the heck is in

78
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
there that makes them work. So, this is

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
exciting for me. This is all science

80
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,640
here. So we have water obviously which

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,680
is the main ingredient. We have an agent

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,760
called sodium C1417 and it helps to bind

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,760
all the substance together. We have the

84
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,000
the essential oils for fragrance and

85
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,840
smell. The preservatives which help to

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,440
prevent the bacteria and the mold from

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,599
accumulating in the wipes and the

88
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,239
glycolic acid which is organic substance

89
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,000
which helps to um make the area smooth.

90
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,120
So how effective are these chemicals in

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,879
getting rid of the germs? I mean how

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,800
this touch the germ is it enough? It's

93
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,080
well, it's effective in in use in

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,599
ridding the germ, but you have to make

95
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,040
sure you use it for the right amount of

96
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,319
time. Wipe the surface for the right

97
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,480
amount of time because if you don't,

98
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,159
then it's not as effective. And we also

99
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,680
find that it could be uh it can if you

100
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
use them or overuse, you can create

101
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,440
superbugs, resistance to superbugs by

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,440
killing that sort of natural good

103
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,680
bacteria. So, the big question is, are

104
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
you using them the right way? Are you

105
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
getting rid of the number of germs that

106
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,120
you think you are? To find out, we set

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,799
up a germ lab experiment, right? With

108
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
the most common germs and bacteria that

109
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
you worry about. Take a look at the mess

110
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,080
we created earlier. This is this is our

111
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,959
show, people, right? These tiles were on

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,159
the floor in front of me. Look,

113
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
someone's chopping up chicken there,

114
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,879
right? And there's raw chicken

115
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,879
everywhere. All potential germs. There's

116
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,560
a dog playing. How cute as he may be.

117
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,159
Then someone was dropping some breakfast

118
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
crumbs all over it and then wiping their

119
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,879
hands on the I just saw a coffin there.

120
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,000
I know I did. You're all guilty as I am

121
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,239
sometimes of trying to get away with

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that. And I've got Jill here who's going

123
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,319
to sort of represent what most of us,

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
including yours truly, normally used to

125
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,319
do before today. When you watch that

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,720
video, do you shudder? Yeah, it looks

127
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,239
really messy and germy. Yes. I mean,

128
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,239
it's worth cleaning that, right? Yeah,

129
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,799
absolutely. So, you like disinfecting a

130
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,240
lot, I'm told. Yes. So, you took a This

131
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,560
is a little experiment, right? We wanted

132
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,840
to find out how much Jill would be

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,639
effective in removing germs because

134
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,560
she's a germ a phobe. Yeah. And we've

135
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,759
got the doc here, Dr. Samson's method is

136
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
a little bit more sophisticated. We're

137
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,199
going to reveal the results. Are you all

138
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,160
into this? Yeah. All right. Now, before

139
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,080
the germ score is revealed, I want to

140
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,840
first show you how contaminated, how

141
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,639
dirty these tiles were after you made

142
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,800
those messes. So, Dr. Samson, how messed

143
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
up were these plates? These tiles? Oh,

144
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
they were they were a mess. They were

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,720
pretty junky and and just contaminated

146
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,280
with all types of uh debris. And the

147
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,000
score was And the score for uh for

148
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,320
Jill's was uh 2859. Now, yours wasn't

149
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,120
much better, by the way. 25.89. Just so

150
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,880
you don't penalize her unfairly, right?

151
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,000
And that's the dirty version, by the

152
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,080
way, of pretty much all of these.

153
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,840
They're in that same range. So 2,500.

154
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
Remember that number. The Jill, please

155
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,639
demonstrate, if you don't mind, how you

156
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,639
would normally clean up a tile. Go

157
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,479
ahead. All right. Okay. Take it out.

158
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,160
Walk us through this. You open it up.

159
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,840
Yeah. It's wet, right? Yeah, it is.

160
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,800
Okay. Cuz sometimes they're dry, guys,

161
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,080
and that doesn't count. And then I just

162
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,639
Yeah. Wipe S motion. And it's so fast,

163
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,479
so easy, right? S motion. That's nicely

164
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,320
done. I like the boot, the bounce to it.

165
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
It's good. It's like a DJ, right? Going

166
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
through it. All right. And it looks

167
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
pretty clean. I think it looks pretty

168
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,919
nice, actually. And this is the after

169
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,639
version of yours. Dr. Davis wasn't so

170
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,479
convinced. So, he picked as he is, got

171
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,160
out one of those germ machines. And what

172
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,240
was her number after her wipe? So, her

173
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,600
number wasn't bad. It was 149 after her

174
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,600
wipe. Well, that's a lot better than it

175
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,440
used to be. Yeah. Right. I think so.

176
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,840
Yeah. You happy with that score? I mean,

177
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,759
it's not perfect. So, I guess what can

178
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,759
we do more of, Dr. Davis? So using your

179
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,759
method before we get to what it is just

180
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,880
show her what she could have had. So it

181
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,039
it could have been better. It could have

182
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,520
you could have had 37 actually which is

183
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
a major improvement almost you know half

184
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,360
or more than half of what it would have

185
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,560
been. So important thing was you did the

186
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,800
right thing. You cleaned the surface

187
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,960
area which which all of us do but we

188
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
find that soap and water good old soap

189
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,680
and water never fails us. So we clean

190
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,520
with that first allow it to dry. Then we

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,880
use a disinfectant wipe to clean. But

192
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,479
it's very important that you follow the

193
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,639
instructions because what we think is

194
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,680
one wipe and done. But you sometimes you

195
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,880
have to go as far as four to 10 minutes.

196
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,800
So you have to make sure that surface

197
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,560
area stays wet and moisturized and you

198
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
may have to use more than one wipe. I'm

199
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,919
going to show you the video of Dr. Davis

200
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,680
doing it the right way. The hard work

201
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,039
backstage. And as you watch this, like

202
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,560
he followed the instructions on the back

203
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,240
of the package. Look how fast he is,

204
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,440
right? But the instructions actually

205
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
tell you to do this. It's tiny print.

206
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
You've all ignored it till now. But it

207
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,960
says you've got to keep going. It's got

208
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,479
to stay wet. So you don't have to rub it

209
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,919
continually for four minutes, but if it

210
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,680
dries out after 30 seconds, you got to

211
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,840
go back and wet it again and do with a

212
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,120
different wipe. Absolutely. So what do

213
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,199
you think? Could this change your

214
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,120
approach to saying clean? Absolutely.

215
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,199
I'm, you know, all about getting rid of

216
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,039
all the germs. So I got to read the

217
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,960
labels more and figure it out, right? My

218
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,800
takeaway was I probably can't get away

219
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,800
with just one wipe. I probably need to

220
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,319
use a second wipe after it's started to

221
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,759
dry just to make sure I'm getting the

222
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,120
effect. So I get rid of truly the germs

223
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,720
and I get rid of all the junk on top of

224
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,919
it. Other than being thorough with the

225
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,680
wipes, what other strategies do you

226
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,599
recommend to the viewers? So, storage is

227
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,280
very important. Uh, storage of the wipes

228
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,479
of the wipes. Very, very important. You

229
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,080
want to make sure you store at room

230
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,520
temperature. Sometimes we keep our wipes

231
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,919
in our car. We keep some all over the

232
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,919
place and if it's placed in extreme heat

233
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,360
or extreme cold, what happens is you

234
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,280
destroy the preservatives and you may

235
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,960
get fold mold. You may get vac

236
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,639
you'd be actually infecting the surface.

237
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,280
Oh no, Joe. You could have hurt

238
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,039
somebody. Darn it.

239
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,720
So, very important that you store it the

240
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,360
correct way and use it. And also, if you

241
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,960
have like microabbrasions or uh little

242
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,240
uh tears on your skin, just want to make

243
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,520
sure you're not sensitive to the wipes

244
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
as well. You may want to use a glove or

245
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,479
something to protect the skin. I stored

246
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
these at the perfect temperature for

247
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,759
you. It's a gift from the show. It's the

248
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
literally the least I could do. Thank

249
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,639
you so much. Now, now that we're done

250
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:12,319
this, up next, what about the wipes for

251
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,160
your body? Right from your hands to your

252
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,000
backside. Let's be clear about this,

253
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,370
right? We're testing them all out. So

254
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,740
you don't have to stick with us.

255
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,740
[Applause]

256
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,599
Is alkaline water the latest hydration

257
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,560
hype? When did something so simple as

258
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,880
water get so complicated? We investigate

259
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,200
the health claims. But what are the real

260
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,959
benefits and won't water down the truth?

261
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,360
We're about to reveal those results in

262
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,200
our first ever water experiment. Plus,

263
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,599
Tony Robbins is here sharing the number

264
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,880
one thing holding you back from success.

265
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,080
I want to show people a little shortcut

266
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,120
that'll give you momentum immediately

267
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,810
and give you power. All new eyes.

268
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,420
That's coming up on Monday.

269
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,420
[Music]

270
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,800
Today we've been investigating the dirty

271
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,880
truth about the wipes you've been using

272
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,040
to clean everything from your hands.

273
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,760
Yes. To your backside. Is it better to

274
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,600
wipe or to wash? We tested it out so you

275
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,720
don't have to. Here to help is Lorie

276
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,720
Jennings, director of the Good

277
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,760
Housekeeping Institute, along with ER

278
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,839
doctor Samson Davis. How did wipes

279
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,760
become such a huge part of our culture?

280
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,600
Why is it a new trend in hygiene? Oh my

281
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,959
gosh, they are just so convenient. I

282
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,399
mean, at the end of the day, you can

283
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,320
literally pull it out and you're good to

284
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,240
go. No sink, nothing else required. It's

285
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,760
fast, it's easy, it's very portable.

286
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,959
Yeah. Look at the And we're going to do

287
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,399
this together now. We're going to look

288
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,279
at the most popular body wipes and try

289
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,040
to figure this out. We're going to start

290
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,200
with hand sanitizers, which so many of

291
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,200
you are in love with. Before the show, I

292
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,200
asked my audience coordinator Stephanie

293
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,120
very innocently to shake every single

294
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,200
person's hand who came to watch today

295
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
the show today. Aren't they so cute?

296
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,160
Stephanie, aren't they the smartest,

297
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,839
friendliest audience in television? You

298
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,959
know it.

299
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,800
It would seem so. However, you shake

300
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,600
that many hands, you tend to pick up

301
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,680
germs. So, Dr. Davis, the germ score,

302
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,279
Stephanie has two hands. They were both

303
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,959
about the same. What was her germ score

304
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,640
number? So, Stephanie germ score was

305
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,399
659. It's all your fault, audience.

306
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,080
She's generally a clean-handed person.

307
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,760
Right now, backstage, Stephanie wiped

308
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,200
down one hand with the wipes. In the

309
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,880
other hand, she's used so soap and

310
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
water. Right. We took the germ score of

311
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,200
each hand separately. It is time to

312
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,399
reveal which hand is less germy. In

313
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,640
other words, if you shake someone's

314
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,720
hand, which tactic is more effective?

315
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:30,560
The germ score with soap and water was

316
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,040
214 and with the wipe 18. Wow. Who would

317
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,480
have thought?

318
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,640
Who would have thought? I'm actually

319
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,320
surprised. I would I'm a big soap and

320
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,760
water guy. I get the convenience of the

321
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,680
wipes, but they do seem I guess if you

322
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,959
do them right, they work, you know. What

323
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
should you be concerned about if you're

324
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,760
using wipes all the time? Well, I mean,

325
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
one of the things that people worry

326
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,560
about is dryness. So, if you're using

327
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,079
them a lot, you might want to look for

328
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,320
for ingredients that are moisturizing

329
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,920
like aloe or vitamin E. Obviously, water

330
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
is the first ingredient, but beyond

331
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,920
that, moisturizing ingredients. All

332
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,120
right, you all clear with hands now?

333
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,040
Now, let's move to what you really want

334
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,880
to hear about. All right, we've all seen

335
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,640
these wipes over here, right? These

336
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
wipes that you got in your bathrooms all

337
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,959
across the country. Flushable. They

338
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,560
called flushable bathroom wipes. Lori,

339
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,720
what happened to paper? When did that

340
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,800
stop doing the job? I mean, for most of

341
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,480
our history, paper was just fine. Well,

342
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,040
and you know what? Paper is still just

343
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,320
fine. And in fact, over 70% of our

344
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,160
audience still use paper. That said, for

345
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,079
those who like the flushable wipes, they

346
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,160
like the feeling of cleanliness. They

347
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,720
like the feeling that there's no dry

348
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,320
residue that that is left behind. They

349
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,519
feel like they're more hygienic. There's

350
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,920
no dry residue. I can just imagine that

351
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,120
crustiness. No paper. No paper left

352
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,640
behind. So, Dr. Sam, no paper, you're an

353
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
ER doctor. You take care of people with

354
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,920
all kinds of problems. People are

355
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,000
extraordinarily passionate about these

356
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,680
wipes, but health-wise, are they in our

357
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,680
best interest? They're I mean, there's

358
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,600
no difference. Uh well actually toilet

359
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,320
paper is still the best. It's the best.

360
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
TP works all the time. Works magic. Uh I

361
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,720
get the comfort and convenience that

362
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,480
people like to use them because they're

363
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,000
close to the hand. You can grab them. Uh

364
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
but it's very important to just stay

365
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,360
with what works, which is, you know,

366
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,959
toilet paper. But also sometimes with

367
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,959
the toilet paper, if it is too rough, it

368
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,639
can cause micro cuts or microabbrasions

369
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,880
as well. So you want to find the right

370
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,360
TP that works for you. I have been an

371
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,120
advocate advocate of using moisture, but

372
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
I never wanted to push wipes on folks.

373
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,360
I'll tell you why. This is a photo

374
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,399
recently of a scuba diver getting ready

375
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,959
to dive into the sewer system to unclog

376
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,240
it in North Carolina. And this, my

377
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,720
friends, is what he pulled out. This

378
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,000
poor soul. Look at all that junk. All

379
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,800
that used disposable flushable wipes.

380
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,880
So, the fact it turns out you can flush

381
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,079
them, but they may not go where you

382
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,760
want. What happens when you flush them

383
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,360
down? You have any idea? Well, yeah. I

384
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,760
mean, they accumulate. So sometimes they

385
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
can clog your sewer system and they

386
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,360
accumulate the bio is they're

387
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,519
biodegradable but they don't break down

388
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,880
as fast as we think they do. I wanted to

389
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,320
figure this out myself. I wanted to find

390
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,079
out what really happens literally to

391
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,480
follow the wipes down your toilet. So

392
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,880
take a look as I did just that.

393
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,279
Millions of you and I include myself in

394
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,079
this are confidently flushing these

395
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,120
wipes down the toilet and thinking all

396
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,720
is well. But is it? I decided to follow

397
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,560
the trail and it turns out that our

398
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,639
little wipes are causing some big

399
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,959
problems for waste and sewage facilities

400
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,360
like this one all around the country.

401
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,320
So, let's dig a little deeper. Follow

402
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,880
me. In the New York City area, most

403
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,040
wipes travel through 7,500 miles of

404
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,959
pipes to end up getting processed here

405
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,760
at the New Town Creek Wastewater

406
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,519
Treatment Plant. Manager Jim Penn agreed

407
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,120
to give me a closer look. Let me take

408
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,880
you down to the belly of the beast.

409
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,000
There's a smell down there. Well, let's

410
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,000
suit up. We'll see what you think.

411
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,760
I wish you guys could smell this right

412
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,760
now. Whoa.

413
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,920
What is that? Smells terrible. Well, Dr.

414
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,160
Oz, that's the sewage coming in from all

415
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
parts of the city. And what what are

416
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,279
these? These are the baby wipes. This is

417
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,040
how the material is coming to us, and

418
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,320
it's causing us big issues. So, where do

419
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,440
you get collected those wipes? Well,

420
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,079
come on. Let me show you. I'll show you

421
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,079
where the process begins.

422
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,369
[Music]

423
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,320
Those are the wipes. Toilet paper breaks

424
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,480
down. You're actually seeing the wipes

425
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,399
in their solid form just the way they

426
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,800
came from the toilet. I can't believe

427
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,240
that. Dr. Oz, take a guess on how many

428
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,480
of these we get into the system every

429
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,120
day. I'm seeing a thousand here already.

430
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
It's tens of thousands on a daily basis.

431
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,160
Dr. Oz, since you're one of the people

432
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,279
that are putting these down the system,

433
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
I'm going to put you to work. Let's go

434
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,279
upstairs and I'll show you where they're

435
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,279
collected. I can't wait.

436
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,079
Here comes some more. Dr. Oz. Okay.

437
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,519
Jeez. I'm working my tail off just so

438
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,959
you keep your tail clean. This is

439
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,079
exactly what I use. This is what I

440
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,360
flushed down the toilet. Why do they

441
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,800
call them flushable? Well, you know,

442
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,399
they are flushable, but they're not

443
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,760
breaking down. Toilet paper breaks down

444
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,959
on its way to the treatment plant. You

445
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,079
wouldn't see any of this material if it

446
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,680
was all toilet paper. So, they're

447
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,360
flushable, but they're not decomposible.

448
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,800
Correct. And where does it go from here?

449
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,040
Well, we take it and we load it into

450
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,240
dumpsters. Let's go and suit up. Suit

451
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,240
up. Go big or go home.

452
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,320
Dr. Ros, take a look.

453
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,790
Well, look, let's not stand there. Let's

454
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,519
get in there.

455
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,800
[Music]

456
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,240
After seeing all these wipes, I'm

457
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,720
officially switching back to toilet

458
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,120
paper. Yeah.

459
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,399
Audience, are you surprised about that?

460
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,240
What do you think about that? That's

461
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,920
just disgusting. Everyone agree? Yes, we

462
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
can do better. So, I got an idea. It's

463
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,519
going to change toilet habits all over

464
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,000
America. Dr. Davis, if you really want

465
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,079
that cleaner feel, is there a better way

466
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,959
that won't clog our toilets? Yes. You

467
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,560
have the toilet paper and a nice water

468
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,880
spray bottle here. You just fold it

469
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,800
once, by the way. Go. And then you just

470
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,399
spray away. And there you have it. Not

471
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,920
too much water. Not too much water. And

472
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,600
there you have it, guys. It's so simple.

473
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,800
And this is disposable. Simple. And this

474
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,720
is uh what are these? 15 cents. Nothing.

475
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,959
You all got it, guys. You knew this. Who

476
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,959
wants this?

477
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,279
So many gifts today. Thank you, Dr.

478
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,550
Davis. Lori, thank you very much. Be

479
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,550
right back.

480
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,550
[Applause]

481
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,680
Up next, an investigation into hair

482
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,360
dyes. Is there lead in your boxed home

483
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,430
hair dye? Find out what we uncovered

484
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,730
about the government's new warning.

485
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,440
[Music]

486
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,040
[Applause]

487
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,959
Today, an investigation into something

488
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,399
that millions of you use to color your

489
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,800
hair at home. Boxed hair dye. It's the

490
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,639
easy, inexpensive way to cover your gray

491
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,560
and to get the color that you love. You

492
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,920
know, you you know the exact box shade

493
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,079
you can get the job done in the comfort

494
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,000
of your own home. It's private. But a

495
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,160
recent national health alert caught my

496
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,959
attention. Lead acetate found in some of

497
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,959
these home hair dyes is a problem. Could

498
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,959
they be the ones that you use? And are

499
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,040
there safer hair dyes you should be

500
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,400
trying? Now, Ken Carl joins us now.

501
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,760
There's a lot of consumer fear out

502
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,439
there, especially since so many of you

503
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,760
are using these products. Dr. Carl's

504
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,679
going to walk us through the facts as we

505
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,919
know them. First off, lead acetate is

506
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,160
used as a color additive. Why? What does

507
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
it mean? Right. So, lead acetate really

508
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
has been used as a color additive in

509
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,919
certain hair dyes, especially the ones

510
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,520
that are applied over time. Um, what

511
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,839
that does is it creates a gradual

512
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,280
coloring effect. And those types of hair

513
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,039
dyes, that gradual effect, we often

514
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,640
think of as progressive hair dyes.

515
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,880
That's what we call them. That, right?

516
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,080
Second, FDA considers it no longer safe.

517
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,679
That's a big deal. How was this

518
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,160
concluded? Well, it is a big deal

519
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,400
because in the 1980s, you know, lead

520
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,799
acetate was listed as safe to use as a

521
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,559
color additive. Um, this is no longer

522
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,000
the case. The FDA has looked at a lot of

523
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,000
information over a lot of years,

524
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
scientific data, etc., and said, again,

525
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,280
this is not necessarily true anymore.

526
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,600
And in fact, exposure to lead acetate is

527
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,320
no longer thought to be insignificant.

528
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,160
And third, importantly, multiple brands

529
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,600
have already done the right thing and

530
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,120
removed it. That's right. And that's

531
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,039
it's a great thing from my perspective.

532
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,039
Um, yeah, a lot of brands have actually

533
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,960
started using other ingredients as color

534
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,520
additives, but there are still a few

535
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,039
that actually do use lead acetate. It's

536
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,200
important for us to remember that

537
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,440
manufacturers have at least a year after

538
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,360
the effective date of final rule to

539
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,720
remove lead acetate from their their

540
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,799
products. So, we have to keep that in

541
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,480
mind. But the guys decide now. Companies

542
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,080
actually did the right thing. Reward

543
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,520
them. Don't reward the guys who didn't

544
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,880
do the right thing. It cost money to do

545
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,400
the right thing. I know many of you

546
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,760
still have questions about hair dyes,

547
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,799
especially did it at home. Mariana is

548
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,679
here. How long have you been dying your

549
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,039
hair at home? I started.

550
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,039
Yeah. There. Thanks for speaking about

551
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,360
this. Yeah. Well, I started dying my

552
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,320
hair um in art school with all the funky

553
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,520
colors like purples, the blues here. Um

554
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
Yeah, we got a little blue here. I see

555
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,880
that. Yep. Um you know, a little bit

556
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,559
more rebellious at the time. And then I

557
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,520
started like lighter trends, lightening

558
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,080
up here um you know as I got older and

559
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,320
then now I'm covering up um the new

560
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,880
grays that are sprouting. So but after

561
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,960
this many years I don't know what that's

562
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,960
done to my hair overall long term or to

563
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,400
my health. Well I I see you're we have

564
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,080
photographic evidence of her obsession

565
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,600
with hair color and you're concerned

566
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,360
about health which is the main reason we

567
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,960
wanted to get into this. You know what

568
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,799
should be be telling people about the

569
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,240
hair dyes? Well make sure by way you got

570
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,200
to make sure that everyone understands

571
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,720
this really clearly. What do you look

572
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,559
for in the box? Right? And and that's

573
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,320
the biggest thing is what we look for on

574
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,919
that box. This is the time to be a smart

575
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,600
consumer. You want to look at that box

576
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,120
and obviously look for the words lead

577
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,640
acetate in the ingredients. But you

578
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,960
know, look, if that seems too confusing

579
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,200
or overwhelming or you can't find it,

580
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,720
look for a warning label. The FDA says

581
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,960
that if a hair dye contains lead

582
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,320
acetate, it should also contain a

583
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,080
warning label. So, just look for that

584
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,840
kind of big that big label that really

585
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,440
should be present. So, Mariana, just

586
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,280
between me and you and a couple million

587
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,120
people, what's the next hair color for

588
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,200
you? Um, probably going with a rose

589
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,640
gold. Rose gold. And now you know what

590
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,559
to look for in the box. Thank you,

591
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Mariana. Thank you. Next, Melissa's

592
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,559
here. She says she swears by box hair

593
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,960
color. How long you been using them for?

594
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,360
Since I was 13. Oh, wow. 13. So, two

595
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,000
years now. Right. Yes, I would. Trying

596
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,559
to be helpful. A question you have about

597
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,120
at home hair dyes would be, would there

598
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,240
be a safer option?

599
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,440
I think that's a really great question,

600
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,960
and I think I think that's something

601
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,039
that we should all be asking ourselves.

602
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,799
There are some um hair products that

603
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,160
contain more natural ingredients. Henna

604
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,360
might be an option for some people and

605
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,760
other ingredients as well. You know what

606
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,280
I did? I went to the expert. I've got

607
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,679
Curly Nikki here and she's got the

608
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,520
answer for you. Take a look. Hey guys.

609
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,919
Hey. Hey. So, if you follow the blog,

610
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,320
curly.com. If you follow my blog, you

611
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,240
know I am a huge do-it-yourself

612
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,400
advocate. But what you might not know is

613
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,919
that I'm also a safety advocate. And if

614
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,679
you're going to color your hair at home

615
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,760
with a box dye, you want to make sure

616
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,080
you're protecting yourself. Open a

617
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,760
window in the bathroom. Cut on the fan.

618
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,919
Make sure that you have good ventilation

619
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,600
in there. Also, get yourself some rubber

620
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,720
gloves to protect your hands. And get

621
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,039
yourself one of these.

622
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,360
I hope that helps. Be safe, but have

623
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,799
fun. Nikki's wonderful. Thank you,

624
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,400
Melissa. I hope that was helpful. But I

625
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,240
want one more a rule of thumb for

626
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,520
everybody when you're using box color at

627
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,520
home is is use a patch test. That means

628
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,600
use a little bit of the dye on your

629
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,520
skin, not your scalp, but on your skin

630
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,880
to see if you have a bad reaction or an

631
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,640
allergic reaction or anything other to

632
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,559
it. That's probably the best way to go.

633
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,240

we're testing out the natural hair color

637
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,360
treatments that are breaking the

638
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,800
internet. But do they work? Find out

639
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,039

640

[Applause]

641
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,799
A wife and a mother of two vanishes

642
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,440
without a trace. Where was this husband?

643
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,840
What's his story? The video message she

644
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,159
left behind. What they revealed changed

645
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,320
everything. And a deadly twist no one

646
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,960
saw coming. Can you imagine doing that

647
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,120
to your children?

648
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,880
Plus, the Alzheimer's blood pressure

649
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,480
connection. Are you at risk? This is

650
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,280
just a terrible thing that's

651
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,990
preventable. All new Oz.

652
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,150
That's coming up on Tuesday.

653
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,280
[Music]

654
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,039
[Applause]

655
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,200
Today we are testing out the biggest

656
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,960
viral hair trends breaking the internet

657
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,799
and they involve some of your favorite

658
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,120
indulgences. Coffee and chocolate. Look

659
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,200
at it pouring out. Now these kitchen

660
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,440
stables have gone viral as natural hair

661
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,799
dyes. But do they really work? Here to

662
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,799
help break it all down is someone who

663
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:29,360
knows a lot about trends. US Weekly

664
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,000
beauty editor Gwen Flamberg. And I gotta

665
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,320
say, people Gwen love spreading their

666
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,760
nice hazelnut chocolate on on their

667
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,919
bread, but they're spreading on their

668
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,000
hair now. Yes, they are. They are.

669
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,400
They're trying it. So, chocolate

670
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,919
hazelnut spread, not just delicious.

671
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,360
Yes. Contains cocoa, which is a natural

672
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,880
stain. Like you've dropped some

673
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,320
chocolate on your tie and Lisa's yelled

674
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,919
at you. Yes, she has many times. Yeah.

675
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,960
So, you know, it's a natural stain. But

676
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,520
that is not all that it has. It also has

677
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,760
palm oil, which is a nutrient for the

678
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,919
hair. So that is like a natural

679
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,360
superpowered conditioner and it's going

680
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,600
to add vibrant shine. So Gwen in theory

681
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,960
in theory it might work. In theory it

682
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,120
should make the hair just a touch darker

683
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,760
and also it is great for neutralizing

684
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,320
brassiness and of course for giving you

685
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,919
magnificent mirror-l like shine. And who

686
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,280
doesn't want shine? All right, we all

687
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,440
want that. So obviously this is an off

688
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,799
label use of hazelnut spread. So we

689
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,880
wanted to put it to the test for some of

690
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,520
our audience members. This is Kelly in

691
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,640
our hair lab backstage

692
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,080
putting on her hair what she hasn't

693
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,039
already eaten. Getting this sweet

694
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,720
treatment. Y'all want to see Kelly now?

695
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,480
Come on out, Kelly. Show us what you

696
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,240
got.

697
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,520
Whoa.

698
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,320
Oh my goodness.

699
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,919
Well, the brassiness is gone. The

700
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,520
brassiness is gone. Come on over here,

701
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,559
Kelly. What do you think about your new

702
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,640
do? So, the color didn't really change,

703
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,400
but the ends are a little bit darker.

704
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,480
You can see some depth in the color and

705
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,039
I think it's definitely shinier. So, it

706
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,360
feels good. I love it. What What do you

707
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,000
think? I think that this ombre like

708
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,320
little shade on the bottom, this little

709
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,559
just tiny touch of darkness makes it

710
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,640
really interesting, really fun,

711
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,559
especially for the holidays. And I mean,

712
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,559
your hair is shiny, girl. It is. It

713
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,480
smells good, too. Shiny. Yes.

714
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,480
Deliciously tasty. You can call it

715
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,440
ombre, Kelly, from now on. Yes. I love

716
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,799
that. I hope you enjoy it. You can

717
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,120
finish what left over here, by the way.

718
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,240
Oh, delicious. Next up, coffee. This is

719
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,320
a real big one. People are thinking

720
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,760
coffee can help with their grays. Gwen,

721
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,640
how does this work as a natural color

722
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,400
boost? So, coffee again is a natural

723
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,799
dye. It's a natural stain. Like, you

724
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,039
know, people for years have been dying

725
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,720
things in coffee and in tea if they want

726
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,720
it just, you know, a little bit like an

727
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,960
a cruise shade. So, that's going to

728
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,880
work. You know, you just you mix a cup

729
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,520
of coffee, brew up a fresh pot of

730
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,679
coffee, let it cool. You do not want to

731
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,000
be pouring boiling hot coffee on your

732
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,400
hair. Mix that cup with a cup of

733
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,559
leave-in conditioner, couple tablespoons

734
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,400
of coffee grounds. Mix it all up,

735
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,120
slather it in. You need to let it kind

736
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,320
of like cook in for an hour, and you

737
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,880
might get a, you know, a little bit of

738
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,799
darkness. It's It's not for uh, you

739
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
know, like a major hair change, but if

740
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,120
you've got a big date, a big meeting,

741
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,360
you're meeting the mother-in-law, you

742
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,120
know, might just help neutralize the

743
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,120
house already. So, Scott is under the

744
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,520
dryer giving it a try. Scott, are you

745
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,960
ready? I'm ready. Your big moment. Okay,

746
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,679
here. One second. Let me pull this up.

747
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,760
Lean forward a little bit. Boom. Okay.

748
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
Now, oh my goodness. What do you think?

749
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,039
Look at it. Look at the monitor.

750
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:35,679
Gorgeous. You like it? I do. I do. And

751
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,240
you know what else? Coffee contains

752
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,240
caffeine. Caffeine stimulates stronger,

753
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,559
healthier hair growth. Describe what you

754
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,400
feel with your hair now. Well, it feels

755
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,480
silkier and I I like the way my hair has

756
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,279
dimension, but it really brought the low

757
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,200
lightss out. like it has the has a nice

758
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,440
coffee odor to it. I like that as well.

759
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,360
And you look very awake. So I brought in

760
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,799
hair stylist to the stars roller. Roy

761
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,880
Tila. Come on over here. Roy, you're

762
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,279
gonna weigh in for us. Thanks for being

763
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,720
here. So you just witnessed two women

764
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,400
who have done amazing things with things

765
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,000
we normally put in our mouth. How often

766
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,320
do you hear these trends from your

767
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,400
clients? We do hear these trends, but I

768
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,320
must warn that not all these trends work

769
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,919
as far as my experience goes. So give me

770
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,919
a hacks, something that that would help

771
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,679
color a woman's hair. a trick, easy,

772
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,039
simple, that you think works, reliable.

773
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,640
Well, with these remedies we're talking

774
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,240
about, it has to be left on an awful

775
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,840
long time and it has to be worked into

776
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,159
the hair in order for it to stay in the

777
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,640
hair the way that we're uh looking for

778
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,559
it to be. So, uh it takes a lot of time,

779
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,240
but also want rinse it out thoroughly

780
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,480
because it could clog the pores of your

781
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,080
skin, create weaker hair growth, maybe

782
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,279
hair loss down the road. So, it has to

783
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,320
be used with caution. So, what do you

784
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,760
recommend? Someone calls you up one of

785
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,039
your big time clients and says, "I got a

786
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
crisis. I got to look better tonight."

787
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,679
What do you say? things that we are

788
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,200
doing at home right now. We're using

789
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,200
these powders just to touch up around

790
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
the hairline, maybe the part of the hair

791
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,120
just to extend that next visit to the

792
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,360
hair salon. How about mascara? How about

793
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,960
that? Uh that is also another kind of

794
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,200
method that we've been using a mascara.

795
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,159
It's a little thick uh a little bit. You

796
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,080
have to comb it through a little bit

797
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,520
more to sort of stretch it out. But yes,

798
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,200
we're doing that, too. That's what guys

799
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,960
do. It does seem to work. Right. Thank

800
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,240
you very much, Gwen. Everybody enjoy

801
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,240
Scotty. We'll be right back.

802
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,960
Up next, the number one thing 450 of the

803
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,320
world's top innovators say will boost

804
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,000
your memory. My friend and wellness

805
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,400
leader Dave Asper is here to reveal it.

806
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,159
The best part of the secret is it's

807
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:30,120
free. Can't beat that.

808
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,120
Here's your daily share.

[Music]

810
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,400
Today, the wisdom of 450 of the world's

811
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,240
top innovators just for you. We've got

812
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,080
the number one thing they say will boost

813
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,000
your memory. Here with the game-changing

814
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,880
advice is the man who interviewed all

815
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,960
450 people. He's been called a health

816
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,799
visionary who started the bulletproof

817
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,190
coffee trend. Please welcome my friend

818
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,070
David Ashbrin.

819
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,559
[Music]

820
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:14,880
[Applause]

821
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,360
Welcome back.

822
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,520
So, I got to say, it's hard to get 450

823
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,440
big-time innovators together to tease

824
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,200
out what makes them special. How'd you

825
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,640
pick the folks that you interviewed? I

826
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,559
wanted to find people who had done

827
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,320
something really noteworthy, something

828
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,559
big, something that changed the world.

829
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,000
And I wanted an excuse to talk to them.

830
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,000
So, I started a podcast called

831
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,080
Bulletproof Radio. And I started asking

832
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
them this one question at the end of

833
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,760
them sharing their knowledge. three most

834
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,840
important things that you would tell

835
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,919
people to do so that they could be

836
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,760
better at everything and then I did the

837
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,600
math on all that at the end of the day.

838
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,840
You compiled all their ideas. So

839
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,279
boosting brain power was a big part of

840
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,440
your goal. I I I suspect you were

841
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,039
surprised by some of their insights.

842
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,320
What blew me away is I thought these

843
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,760
people would say I wanted to be the best

844
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,600
in my field. I wanted to make a lot of

845
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,960
money. I wanted to win. You know what

846
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,880
they all said? Number one, my health. If

847
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,320
my body doesn't work, I can't do what

848
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,760
I'm here to do. I won't achieve my

849
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,720
mission. So that's what they cared about

850
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,840
most. They cared about food, community,

851
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,000
stress, sleep. None of them cared about

852
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,600
dollars. Yeah. Like most human beings

853
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,120
care about what really matters. Come on

854
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,799
over here. Number one thing that the

855
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,240
world's innovators say will boost your

856
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,640
memory is actually allowing you to ditch

857
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,159
decision fatigue. Decision fatigue is

858
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,760
all the things you're thinking about

859
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,679
that just wear you down so you start

860
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,600
making bad decisions. It is estimated

861
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,520
that we make thousands and thousands of

862
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,919
decisions in a day. Most of which, I got

863
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,559
to say, you're not even aware of. So,

864
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,200
how do these decisions pile up on you

865
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,799
and drain your brain? They pile up on

866
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,159
you because there's a limit to the

867
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,480
number of decisions you can make before

868
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,080
you just run out. And this just makes

869
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,919
sense. But there's see how full the body

870
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,640
is, see how robust the brain is

871
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,640
energized, see how it drains out because

872
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,720
of that. Yeah. And every day it drains

873
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,480
out. There was a study in Israel where

874
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,440
they looked at parole boards and they

875
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,640
said, "What's the number one thing

876
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,559
that's going to get someone out of jail

877
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,320
early? Is it their gender, their crime,

878
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,559
how much education they did?" None of it

879
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,000
mattered. What mattered was the time of

880
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,360
day when you got your pole board

881
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,960
hearing. If you come in in the morning,

882
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,799
85% chance they're going to make a

883
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,360
decision to let you out. End of the day,

884
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,200
85% chance you're going to stay in jail.

885
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,360
So, what does that mean for us? It means

886
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,039
that if we can reserve some of our

887
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,799
little decisions that don't matter so we

888
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,240
can make more important big decisions,

889
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,919
you can actually change your life. Just

890
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,279
help me with that again. So the judges

891
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,039
were getting so exhausted making

892
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,120
decisions. Yeah. That for them the

893
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,120
making no decision was saying no parole,

894
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,799
right? Exactly. So it was a copout

895
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,159
decision. It was a copout decision and

896
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,360
it was because they were out of good

897
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,960
decisions. They just couldn't think

898
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,159
about it and make decision. Ah, no. It's

899
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,760
easier just to say no and not think

900
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,520
about it. Guys, this sink into you know

901
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,720
how you get muscle fatigue from doing

902
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,320
stuff too much? You can get brain

903
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,399
fatigue, which is why you have to

904
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,320
preserve that brain just you have. So I

905
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,880
asked Trish, a busy mom, to log her

906
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,120
decisions to see how it affects her. She

907
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,840
figured for you. Is this your decision

908
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,000
diary? This is lots of things you wrote

909
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,279
down there. Yes. A lot. All right. So, a

910
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
lot more than I thought I would. Isn't

911
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,240
that I I did this experiment just in

912
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,760
preparation for this. So, let's just

913
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,200
start the You get up in the morning.

914
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,799
Literally, you're just opening your

915
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,320
eyes. How many decisions have you

916
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,520
already made? I made 45 decisions. And

917
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,600
who would have thought that? I mean,

918
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,200
here I'm laying in bed and and and the

919
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,360
fact that I had to keep track of these

920
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,279
things really made me think about every

921
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,640
single little decision. Do I turn on my

922
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,720
right? Should I roll to my left? Should

923
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,240
I lay here? How much longer can I sleep?

924
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,480
How many times can I hit the snooze

925
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,919
button? Yeah, the mind is de is a

926
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,360
dangerous place to live. It's all all

927
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,799
kind especially in the morning for me.

928
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,720
It's when I start to ruminate a bit.

929
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,760
Okay. What's the crisis time for you?

930
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,440
The time of the day where you make the

931
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,120
most decisions. Well, it's actually a

932
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,279
pretty long time for me because I work

933
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,000
from home. So, it was about 8:30 to

934
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,000
about 3:00. Um, all of my design work,

935
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,760
it's like every decision, decisions, all

936
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,840
decisions all day, every second of the

937
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,279
day. It feels like almost. Do you have a

938
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,120
final tally? Was it possible to keep

939
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,039
track of how many decisions you made?

940
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,600
Well, I must admit, Dr. Oz, I gave up

941
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:07,039
around 6:00 because, like I said, I'm a

942
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:10,320
busy mom. But it was 1,879

943
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,440
decisions all before 6 p.m. Look at

944
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,640
that. That I don't know. I don't know

945
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,559
how you feel about this, but that's

946
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,919
stunning to me. And And if I can just

947
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,679
bring one thing up, at 6 o'clock, when

948
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,000
you were done counting, were you pretty

949
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,600
tired? Oh, I was I was like brain dead.

950
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,120
I felt like I was brain dead. I was so

951
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,039
exhausted. All I wanted to do is just

952
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,640
sit there, veg out, turn the TV on, so I

953
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,240
didn't have to think. I didn't have to

954
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,679
think about making decisions anymore. If

955
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
you had made decisions after six, would

956
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,200
they have been good ones, do you think?

957
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,120
Probably not. That's when the bewitching

958
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,960
hour, you eat the wrong things, you you

959
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,640
fight with the wrong people. We can't

960
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,399
stop making decisions. So, help me

961
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,159
understand what's the strategy to make

962
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,760
sure we don't, you know, get into this

963
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,840
fatigue setting. How do we boost our

964
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,600
memory? You can automate decisions. You

965
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,200
can decide, I make this decision every

966
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,880
day and it does nothing to improve my

967
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,120
life. Can I just make it once and always

968
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,360
do it that way? And people we've seen

969
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,919
Mark Zuckerberg, political figures, lots

970
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,279
of people with busy lives have figured

971
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,960
out the secret. And sometimes you'll see

972
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,480
it in what they wear or you'll see it in

973
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,000
the way they do different things

974
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,120
throughout the day because they stopped

975
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,559
thinking about it because they had a

976
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,919
bigger mission. And I think everyone on

977
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,440
the planet has a bigger mission even if

978
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,039
it's just to be nice to our family more.

979
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,240
You can make a decision to do that. Is

980
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,440
that why Steve Jobs always wore a

981
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,919
turtleneck? You think that's exactly

982
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,559
why. Yeah. And Mark Zuckerberg, the

983
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,640
Adidas and the hoodie years. And he did

984
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,320
the same thing as Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs

985
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,679
was a visionary in multiple ways. All

986
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,279
right, so we have a video from one of

987
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,039
Dave's thought leaders who says, "This

988
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,480
has been a very helpful way to boost her

989
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,320
brain power." Take a look. Hi, Dr. Oz. I

990
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,880
used to rack my brain just trying to

991
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,360
figure out what to have for breakfast.

992
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,519
Now, I just drink a blended coffee.

993
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Simple. As an emotional intelligence

994
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,480
expert, this is what we teach our

995
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,200
clients. Bottom line, to ditch brain

996
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,679
fatigue, simplify and streamline your

997
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,279
choices. Thanks a lot. This is something

998
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,960
that everyone can start doing right now.

999
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,440
So, we ask the audience to name two

1000
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,519
things they can automate in their lives.

1001
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,799
Iris, you are nominated to go first. Two

1002
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,039
things. I will stick to only one commute

1003
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,000
a day instead of figuring out which

1004
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:11,359
subway could go faster today. Um, and

1005
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,960
also uh set only one alarm uh instead of

1006
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,679
wondering backups. All right, that's

1007
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,079
good. Two things. Yes, I'm a housewife.

1008
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,320
So, one of the things that I will try to

1009
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,040
eliminate is grocery shopping because I

1010
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,119
do that like five times a week. And I I

1011
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,800
think I if I could reduce the amount of

1012
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,720
time that I go to the supermarket and do

1013
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,839
grocery shopping. The other thing will

1014
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,599
be my haircut or my hair style and doing

1015
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,440
that, postponing that, making

1016
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,720
appointment, cancelling. So, that would

1017
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,000
be another thing that I would So, I'll

1018
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,440
give you what I do. First of all, I try

1019
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,440
to dress the same way when I come to

1020
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,399
work. I don't change it a lot. That way,

1021
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,599
I don't have to spend a lot of time

1022
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,280
reinvisioning how I'm going to get

1023
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,720
dressed. That's why schools for kids

1024
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,240
used to always require dress codes. One

1025
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,679
less thing for the kids to think about,

1026
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,679
right? And I also have the same

1027
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,520
breakfast every single day. That way,

1028
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,560
you know, why reinvent the wheel? Figure

1029
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,839
something that works for you.

1030
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,040
Experiment. Once you figure it out, just

1031
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,160
do it for the rest of your life. It's

1032
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,680
why I'm still married at 33 years.

1033
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,200
Nothing that I automate is what I put

1034
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,320
into my green drink. And we've heard

1035
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,000
about the green drink, right? And I like

1036
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,000
it a lot. But I hear there's a new green

1037
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,520
drink with one ingredient on the block

1038
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,880
that I've got to try. You will never

1039
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,200
guess what it is. We're going to share

1040
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,920
the secret when we come back. Ready

1041
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,560
[Applause]

1042
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,200
[Music]

1043
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,839
for this? It's the dish on Oz. Our brand

1044
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,480
new food series. Make it tasty. Daffy Oz

1045
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,040
and Friends.

1046
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,760
We're serving it up every Wednesday. The

1047
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,760
dish on Oz.

1048
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:37,440
[Applause]

1049
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,359
Today, the new green juice that I have

1050
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,119
not tried yet. It's getting a lot of

1051
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,359
buzz everywhere, especially since it's

1052
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,119
only got one ingredient, which I hear is

1053
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,960
flying off the shelves of grocery

1054
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,040
stores. I want you all to guess what it

1055
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,040
is. Well, Miss Leer Dave Asper is back

1056
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,920
with a few hints on what this mystery

1057
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,560
drink is. This is an extreme close-up

1058
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,079
shot of this vegetable. So, are you

1059
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,720
ready for the clues? Ready for the

1060
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,320
clues. Clue number one. It helps with

1061
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,760
gas and bloating. All right. Notice

1062
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,680
there all kinds of little holes in

1063
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,440
there. It is a vegetable. You know that

1064
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,200
already. And these things probably

1065
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,400
represent a little bit of fiber. So just

1066
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,400
let you know at Okay, clue number two.

1067
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,720
Almost completely made of water.

1068
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,720
What do you guys think? Made of water.

1069
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,240
You're getting a little better view. I

1070
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,520
can sort of see the color a little bit

1071
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,440
coming up, right? It's either going to

1072
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,760
be a greenish or bluish color. All

1073
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,359
right, clue number three. Most people

1074
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,680
can't live without this when they have

1075
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:36,160
their wings and blue cheese. They'll

1076
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,920
know that. Buffalo wings, blue cheese.

1077
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,400
Yes, they all know it's celery. You gave

1078
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,760
it away. They wouldn't get it from the

1079
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,400
That's what we're talking about. Come on

1080
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,000
now. You know, it is a unique time in my

1081
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,440
life when I can actually say we have

1082
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,359
were buffalo wings and blue cheese and

1083
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,800
everyone guesses it's the celery, right?

1084
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,560
And all the other clues we threw out

1085
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,000
there like this chlorophyll, the green,

1086
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,359
nothing. Nothing from you guys. Just

1087
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,400
that, right? Everyone's clicking their

1088
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,680
nose. They can't believe you actually

1089
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,920
make a juice out of it. But people can't

1090
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,079
find celery in stores anymore. It's

1091
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,800
really easy to make a juice out of it.

1092
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,079
All you have to do is take it leaves and

1093
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,520
all. You notice there's leaves on there.

1094
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,640
Yeah. Dump it in the blender.

1095
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,000
Little bit of water. A little bit of

1096
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,599
water so it'll actually blend. Although

1097
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,119
there's a lot of water and celery. So,

1098
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,359
yeah. And you want to keep that celery

1099
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,960
water and you just put the lid on, blend

1100
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,560
it up. If you have a juicer, you can do

1101
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,720
that. But here's the trick. You can just

1102
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,240
scoop out the pulp if you want or like I

1103
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,079
do, I just leave the pulp in there and

1104
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,680
then I drink it. What's the benefit?

1105
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,119
What do I get if I drink this? Well,

1106
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,599
you're certainly going to be getting a

1107
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,359
substantial amount of antioxidants from

1108
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,920
this, which is something that a lot of

1109
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,000
people wouldn't know. Celery, like all

1110
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,839
vegetables, is full of polyphenols.

1111
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,599
These things that studies are finding

1112
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,280
over and over, not just in celery, but

1113
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,760
just that class of compounds. The same

1114
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,680
thing in spice and coffee, tea. It feeds

1115
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,280
the good bacteria in your gut and it is

1116
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,640
an antioxidant directly in the body. All

1117
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,560
right, audience. I've given you a little

1118
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,160
bit of the juice, right? Give it a taste

1119
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,680
while we talk a little bit about this.

1120
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,040
Remember, studies on celery juice.

1121
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,720
People haven't looked at it specifically

1122
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,560
as a drink, but it's a guilt-free food,

1123
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,359
guys. There's six calories, six calories

1124
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,880
in one of these little stalks. So, front

1125
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,320
are you. What do you guys think? Just

1126
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,240
don't don't have it vote yet. Just

1127
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,480
listen for a second before you judge

1128
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,400
because I'm going to try too in case

1129
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,240
there's any complainers out there about

1130
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,920
the taste of celery juice just in case.

1131
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,200
What do you What's a hack for it? I like

1132
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,040
to put a few different things in it.

1133
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,480
I've tried apple cider vinegar, lemon

1134
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,960
juice, but the one that works really

1135
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,480
reliably is just a little bit of apple.

1136
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,560
You put it in the blender and it

1137
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,920
sweetens it up just a perfect way. All

1138
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,680
right, let's let's go over talk to the

1139
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,920
audience here. Now, my thoughts are I

1140
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,720
got to say it does taste a Grab a juice.

1141
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,560
It does taste a little bit bland. I

1142
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,960
don't want to make put anything awkward

1143
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,480
in your mouth. Bland a little, but I can

1144
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,640
do it. You could do it. Blend. I think

1145
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,000
I'd add lemon or apple. You would? Here,

1146
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,440
try the apple then see what you think. I

1147
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,880
want some honest opinions here. Are you

1148
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,119
a bland girl or a happy girl? Is a

1149
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,280
little bit bland? Much better. A little.

1150
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,320
Much better. Are you guys related? No,

1151
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,400
we're friends. We're friends. All right,

1152
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,160
give it a taste then.

1153
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,560
I want some honest I got to taste it,

1154
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,280
too. Very different with a with a little

1155
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,560
bit of a apple, right? Yeah. Oh, that

1156
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,560
makes What are you talking about? That

1157
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,880
makes a huge difference. It does. Were

1158
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,680
you okay with the way it was? Yeah.

1159
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,720
They're stoic. If I were you, I had a

1160
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,839
little apple juice or some of the apple

1161
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,440
cider vinegar. That would get me over

1162
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,880
the edge. Listen, David, thanks for

[Applause]

1171
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,480
Is alkaline water the latest hydration

1172
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,440
hype? When did something so simple as

1173
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,760
water get so complicated? We investigate

1174
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,160
the health claims. But what are the real

1175
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,839
benefits and won't water down the truth?

1176
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,240
We're about to reveal those results in

1177
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,079
our first ever water experiment. Plus,

1180

That's coming up on Monday.

1184
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:05,040
In 10 years, my kids have grown up. I

1185
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,599
become a grandfather. And I even have a

1186
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,920
few more gray hairs. I've gotten to know

1187
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,240
myself better by meeting you. It's you

1188
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,000
who taught me to listen. You've inspired

1189
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,880
me. You've given me hope. And you've

1190
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,040
been here for the ride. Together, change

1191
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,400
happens. Our journey is just beginning.

1192
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,720
It's a story that's going to change

1193
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,320
lives and save lives.

1194
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,510
So, I feel pretty good about life right

1195
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:32,329
now.

1196
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:32,329
[Music]

1197
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,480
It's the foodie trend taking over

1198
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,200
Instagram. Taking perfectly yummy food

1199
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,960
like this burger and then having edible

1200
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,599
glitter. Watch this.

1201
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,400
Or little edible edible glitter on these

1202
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,560
cupcakes. Or how about this sushi,

1203
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,880
right? And not just the glitter, right?

1204
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,480
Add a little sparkle to that. Look at

1205
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,920
this. Imagine your burger looking like

1206
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,920
that. Or cupcakes that are golden,

1207
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,200
literally. Right. All the sparkle. I

1208
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,839
mean, I don't know. If I had a choice

1209
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,040
between sushi with gold and the bland

1210
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,920
old fashioned sushi, what do you think?

1211
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,520
Would you go for it? Yeah. Even popular

1212
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,319
fast food chains are hopping on the

1213
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,839
trend with 24

1214
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:19,920
karat chicken wings

1215
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,720
like these.

1216
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,280
I mean, I don't know about you guys,

1217
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,760
but for some, all that glitters is not

1218
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,839
gold. So, I am curious, my beloved

1219
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,560
audience, what do you think? Could this

1220
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,160
be part of your future?

1221
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,400
Now, anybody want to taste one of these?

1222
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,319
These are very Oh. Oh, we got one here.

1223
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,240
Go ahead and give that a shot. Grab one

1224
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,960
of those. And while you're tasting that,

1225
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,000
just enjoy. Oh, she spilled gold on her

1226
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,160

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,760
like it? I love it. And you're shining.

1228
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,960
You said I'm already bright. Like, this

1229
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,040
is so good. All right. I love it. Now,

1230
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,200
this is not your cup of tea. No, that's

1231
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,240
like for Instagram show off. And plus, I

1232
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,240
already have enough spark already.

1233
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,079
That first of all, is it taste okay? Do

1234
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,480
you want the truth? Yes. It's the truth.

1235
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,920
It's a little bit too much. But um the

1236
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,400
chicken's really good still. It's just

1237
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,520
too much gold. But I like it. Oh my

1238
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,319
goodness. Let me taste one of these

1239
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,319
things. You guys are so picky.

1240
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,040
It tastes like chicken. It's fine.

1241
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,640
Anyway, I love that people are getting

1242
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,240
their creative juices going with their

1243
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,920
food. From a health perspective,

1244
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,440
consuming Gold Flake or Edible Sparkles

1245
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,480
is thought to be completely safe. It

1246
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,240
ought to pass through your digestive

1247
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,720
system without being absorbed into your

1248
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,280
bloodstream. But if it's not your jam,

1249
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,880
you can always do it for the gram. Take

1250
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,400
the gold. Remember everybody, change is

1251
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,640
happening. Our journey is just

1252
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,640
beginning. It's a little bad aftertaste.

1253
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,899
