The cauliflower craze continues, but are

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,920
the pre-made alternatives all a

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,440
cauliflower con? It's not just

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,440
cauliflower that you're getting. And

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,240
Wednesday, ready for this? It's the dish

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,800
on Oz, our brand new food series.

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,039
Perfect. Perfect. Daphne Oz and friends

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,640
are dishing on the hottest food trends.

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,120
I always like to heat things up a little

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,519
bit. Coming up next.

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,120
Da

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,680
Cauliflower. Oh, I love it. Just a few

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:03,000
years ago, it exploded into notoriety as

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,439
a low carb craze gained full

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,240
steam. Pinterest pages taught us how to

21
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,640
pulverize us into this faux fried rice.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,880
We can make homemade pizza crust. You

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,360
can mash it up like potatoes, even turn

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,000
it into buffalo wings. And now we've

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,560
entered another boom. Cauliflower

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,560
convenience. Our supermarket shelves are

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,799
bursting with every possible incarnation

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,439
of this this cruciferous veggie under

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,600
the sun. But are these pre-made

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,759
cauliflower products really low carb,

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,560
low calorie comfort food, or are you

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,560
being conned? Today we investigate. My

cauliflower product testing lab. We

36
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
asked the Collie lovers in our audience

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,759
to bring in their favorite cauliflower

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,600
products and JJ's scientifically

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,840
evaluating them right now. And I'm also

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,520
joined by America's test kitchens Julia

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,720
Colin Davidson who's been following this

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
cauliflower boom very close. Hello. So,

43
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,840
first of all, why has cauliflower gotten

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
so popular and how has it shaped what

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
we're beginning to see in supermarkets?

46
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,680
Yeah, it's a downright craze these days

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,600
and it's due to a few reasons. First

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,119
off, the recession, which really

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,200
encouraged people to step away from

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,879
expensive meat-based recipes and really

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
take another look at vegetable-based

52
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,400
recipes because they're less expensive.

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
But what really takes cauliflower over

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
the top compared to all the other

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,239
vegetables is that you can throw it into

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
any recipe. It really just takes on

57
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,520
whatever flavor you give it. It's very

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,840
versatile. It's like a a vegetable

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
chameleon, right? It just adapts to its

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,599
environment and that's gotten everyone

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,680
on board. Yeah. Yeah. And of course, all

62
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,959
the big brands have taken notice and so

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,640
they're really putting out some really

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,760
interesting and creative new cauliflower

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,120
based products. So, we're going to

66
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
evaluate those today. We're going to

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,879
start with cauliflower pizza. So,

68
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,040
Sheena's backstage with JJ in our

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,800
cauliflower product testing lab with her

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,400
favorite pizza crust. So, Sheena, please

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
describe your first impression of the

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,560
product. I mean, it looks good to me.

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
It's made with real cauliflower,

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,599
gluten-free. I would assume that that

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,080
would mean it's low carb because

76
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,680
cauliflower is traditionally low carb.

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,680
All right, JJ, you took a little deeper

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,280
look at this pizza crust and others like

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,360
it. Give us a reality check. What did

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
you find? Okay, so what I did was

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,440
compare the cauliflower pizza crust with

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,920
a traditional pizza crust. And what I

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,360
found was that in a traditional pizza

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,840
crust, it's about 125 to 150 calories

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,480
per serving and about maybe 23 to 35 net

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,640
carbs. Now, cauliflower pizza crust had

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,080
a wide range. it was really all over

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,480
anywhere from 80 to 170 calories and

89
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,560
then net carbs was anywhere from 2 to

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,080
23. So what that means is you're going

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,120
to have to really really look at the

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
nutritional label because it's not

93
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,040
necessarily lower in calories or carbs.

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,400
That was hard to find. You know, if you

95
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,519
just show me this, I was surprised to

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
find that some of these cauliflower

97
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,879
crusts actually have more calories and

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,560
carbs than just getting a regular old

99
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,840
pizza crust, which is shocking to me.

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
Yeah. So I think a lot of folks think

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,519
that this is really just cauliflower,

102
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,120
right? Maybe with a binder thrown in

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,799
like egg. Yeah, this this looks like

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,879
this, right? Mash that up, pulverize it,

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,879
get this. Yeah, but the reality is most

106
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,959
uh crusts include a lot more ingredients

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,879
than that. Yeah, that's a lot. And so,

108
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,360
first I want to focus on these flowers

109
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,360
and starches like tapioca, cornstarch,

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,120
brown rice. They add that allimportant

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
chew to the pizza crust cuz without

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,360
chew, it's not a pizza, right? But this,

113
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,120
of course, boosts all those net carbs.

114
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
And then look at the fats. You have egg,

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,799
you have olive oils that add richness

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,320
and all these flavorings, some of which

117
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,639
are natural, but look at this zanthan

118
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,919
gum. That's a processed food. So, it's

119
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,280
not just cauliflower that you're

120
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,720
getting. So, Sheena, are you a little

121
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,440
surprised by what's in your cauliflower

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,199
pizza? Uh, very surprised. I had no idea

123
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,639
it had all that. And Jenny, what else

124
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,840
did you find about the cauliflower crust

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,160
that surprised you? Well, this was so

126
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,560
surprising to me. Cauliflower pizza

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,840
crust has two to three times more fat.

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,199
This is no bueno. No good. All right. So

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,040
what where is the fat from? You showed

130
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,199
us some oils over here. That's it. And

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,199
so the oils in the eggs do account for

132
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,040
some of the fat, especially for crusts

133
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,720
that have those starches in it, but some

134
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
of the crusts consider themselves low

135
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,720
carb. So they swap the starches and the

136
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,720
fat for cheese and a lot of cheese. Oh

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,400
my goodness. Yeah. And so, okay, these

138
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
are this is low carb, but all this

139
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,000
cheese, it adds flavor. It adds texture,

140
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,520
which is important, but now you've

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,479
jacked up the saturated fat. And of

142
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,320
course, at the end of the day, it's

143
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,680
still pizza, right? It's still a treat.

144
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,360
This shouldn't be a daily thing. And

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,039
they stuff on top of it also cuz the

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,120
cauliflower pizza crusts are easy to

147
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,240
make at home and you can control all the

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,520
ingredients that go into it if you do it

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,039
that way. Take a look at this video

150
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,240
showing you you how to make one. It's

151
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,660
super simple. I'm also going to put it

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:39,380
on my Facebook

153
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:39,380

154
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,800
page.

[Music]

156
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Heat. Heat.

[Music]

158
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,579
[Music]

159
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,080
I got hungry watching that video. So

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,120
simple. And again, this uses this raw

161
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
material. Cauliflower we all

162
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,319
acknowledge. But when we're talking

163
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
about pre-made cauliflower foods, the

164
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,840
search continues. Yes, it does. So, what

165
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,280
about cauliflower tots and fries? They

166
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,400
almost seem too good to be true. Yeah.

167
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,000
You know, I tried these. They're pretty

168
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,360
good. They're crisp on the outside.

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,919
They've got decent flavor. They're

170
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,600
creamy on the inside. They're not bad.

171
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,120
Yeah. Tastes like potatoes. Yeah. But

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,840
let's be real. This isn't these aren't

173
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,680
vegetables. This is a vegetable product,

174
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
right? And so, at the end of the day,

175
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,800
how good or bad these are for you really

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,400
depends on the product itself. So, you

177
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,919
have to read the label. All right. So

178
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,680
Margie's backstage with JJ in the

179
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,479
cauliflower product testing lab with her

180
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,479
favorite cauliflower tots. So Margie,

181
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
what do you like about the tots? It's a

182
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,680
good way definitely to sneak in the

183
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,680
vegetable into my kid that's pretends

184
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,960
she's allergic to vegetables. So, but

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,479
whatever works if you're a mom. But

186
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
let's get into the nutrition side of

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,479
these things. JJ, what did you find?

188
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,680
Well, this is a good news story. I found

189
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,840
that the traditional tater tots are high

190
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,520
in both calories and carbs.

191
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,080
But if you look, you'll see that the

192
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,720
cauliflower t cauliflower tots are a lot

193
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,919
lower. See, they have less calories and

194
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,199
less carbs. However,

195
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:43,360
however, sometimes there's this hidden

196
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,120
ingredient. It won't always be in bowl,

197
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,039
but it'll be there. And it's a hybrid

198
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,280
where they have cauliflower and the

199
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,199
potato combined. And when you add in

200
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,759
that the potato, now you can see it's

201
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,240
virtually almost as high in calories as

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,319
the regular tater tots. So, you're going

203
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,840
to really have to be a detective and

204
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
look at these nutritional labels. But

205
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,560
straight up, cauliflower tater tots.

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,319
They are good to go. All right. Up next,

207
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,600
it's the new cauliflower past that

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,680
everyone is obsessed with. Stick around.

209
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,980
[Music]

210
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,319
[Applause]

211
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:17,080
[Music]

212
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,199
We're taking on fakers,

213
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,720
frauds, and foes. I'm burning this. It's

214
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,720
smoking, but there's no melting. and

215
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
investigating how one man faked a

216
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,280
disability. Changing his diaper, it's

217
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,039
just gross. For his own twisted

218
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,080
pleasure.

219
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,080
That's coming up

220
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:39,680
[Applause]

221
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,000
tomorrow. They're selling out

222
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,519
nationwide. Customers fighting over bags

223
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,760
at the grocery stores. That's right.

224
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,959
There's a rush on the latest cauliflower

225
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,480
pasta on the market. Cauliflower noki.

226
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,920
Now today we're revealing the surprising

227
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,560
ingredient that makes these fluffy

228
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,320
comforting pasta pillows so good.

229
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Nutritionist JJ Smith is backstage

230
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,959
manning our cauliflower product test

231
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,440
lab. So what kinds of cauliflower pastas

232
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,040
are you seeing back there JJ? They are

233
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,720
bringing me so many different

234
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,839
cauliflower pasta, cauliflower

235
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:14,240
spaghetti, cauliflower pin, and my

236
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:17,120
favorite cauliflower noki. This is this

237
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,880
is my beloved cauliflower noki. Well, I

238
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,399
want to get into this noki issue because

239
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
frozen cauliflower noki really has taken

240
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,920
over Instagram. People are dressing it

241
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,240
up like gourmet pastas. Look at those

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,480
pictures. Oh, dectable. So, to see how

243
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,320
cauliflower pasta stands up to the real

244
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,680
deal, I decided to bring in my good

245
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,440
friend Pasqual. He hails from Italy,

246
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,760
teaches Americans how to cook pasta the

247
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,959
Italian way on YouTube. But could he

248
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,440
taste the difference between a

249
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,200
cauliflower noki and a potato noki? But

250
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,640
folks love watching you, don't they?

251
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,720
Yeah. They're calling you from the old

252
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,680
country.

253
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:53,440
Everybody, the people in my sidor in

254
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,320
Italy, everybody said, "Pasqual, we see

255
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,320
you that

256
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:05,320
her was in Italy working a farm. We was

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,680
eat cauliflower in the

258
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:14,040
morning, 12:00 lunch, had dinner." Yep.

259
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,040
Cauliflower in the morning.

260
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,760
I like it too. I like it too. But here's

261
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
the question. This question most people

262
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,720
don't really know what a noki is. We

263
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
can't even pronounce it right over here.

264
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
So educate folks what's a noki and let's

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,240
get into whether you can make a noki

266
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,240
with cauliflower. Does it have to be

267
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:44,720
potatoal? Flour. It's really good and

268
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,880
with a potato too, but you taste this

269
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,040
with the noki with a cauliflower. Y it's

270
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,480
a good taste. All right. So JJ, while

271
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,519
I'm learning about Noki here, compare it

272
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,399
to the real deal nutritionally. Well, we

273
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,480
just learned that noki has a potato in

274
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,160
it. So you can see that it's higher in

275
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,839
calories and carbs. However, if you look

276
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,320
at cauliflower noki, you'll see that

277
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,880
it's 140 calories, 18 net carbs, a lot

278
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,720
lower than the traditional noki. So,

279
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,640
it's definitely a better option,

280
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,680
but there's always a there's always a

281
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,480
butt. There's always a butt. We did find

282
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,360
that cauliflower noki was two times

283
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,360
that's double the fat, and that is not

284
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,200
ideal. Now, this isn't a deal breaker,

285
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,120
but it is something I wanted everyone to

286
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
be aware of. All right, give it a taste

287
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,880
now. See if you're happy with it. Even

288
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,160
with a little extra fat.

289
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,839
Yes, there's been a happy Italian man.

290
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
All right, so America's test kitchen

291
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,120
Julia Colin Davidson is back. We looked

292
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,040
at the the ingredients. We're going to

293
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,480
put them up here for cauliflower noki.

294
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,839
And please help us understand about this

295
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,240
extra fat as well. Yeah. So there you

296
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,000
go. So majority of the ingredient is

297
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,040
cauliflower. That's good news. And here

298
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,399
are the rest of the ingredients. You

299
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
have some cassava and you have some

300
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,079
potato. Potato is obviously the

301
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
traditional ingredient in this classic

302
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,279
dumpling. a little bit of olive oil,

303
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,200
sometimes some egg, and this is where

304
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,720
the fats coming from. So, but if you

305
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,079
look at this on the whole, we know what

306
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
these ingredients are. They're very

307
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,360
simples. You know, you can pronounce

308
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,360
them all. They're from real food. So,

309
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,440
I'm a fan of these. I like it, too. And

310
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,360
it tastes good according to Pasal. So,

311
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,600
don't be afraid of the potato. A spot of

312
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,440
the spud is not a bad thing. Cauliflower

313
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,959
noki is a good tool if you're on paleo

314
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
because a lot of potatoes. And if you're

315
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,760
on just starting the keto where I know

316
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,800
they don't want potatoes, you got to

317
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,079
skip it for a little while, but after

318
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,240
you get on the program, you can try it

319
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,000
there, too. So, up next, the cauliflower

320
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,880
product that has started it all.

321
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,970
Pre-made cauliflower rice. Or is it just

322
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,340
cauliflower or a

323
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,739
[Music]

324
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,739
[Applause]

325
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,519
conan? Where do we go when we die? We're

326
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,920
unraveling this medical mystery and

327
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,430
examining the last moments of life. All

328
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,350
new Oz. That's coming up Friday.

329
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,440
[Music]

330
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,360
[Applause]

331
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,360
Cauliflower has been conquering nearly

332
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,079
every carb in the market, but the one

333
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,240
that started it all, rice. It has become

334
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,399
so popular that the rice industry itself

335
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,160
feels threatened. Rice lobbying groups

336
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,800
are even asking the FDA to consider

337
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,839
banning the word rice from cauliflower

338
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,320
products. What do you guys think about

339
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,920
that? A big battle going on. So, Julia

340
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,600
Colin Davidson is here from America's

341
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,480
Test Kitchen. What is your take on

342
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,000
cauliflower rice? It's delicious. I love

343
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,440
cauliflower rice. I make it a lot at

344
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,760
home. And the good thing is it's just

345
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,959
cauliflower. There's no other

346
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,959
ingredients hiding or lurking in

347
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,720
cauliflower rice. Easy to make. You just

348
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,160
take a head of cauliflower, you core it,

349
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,760
you cut it into pieces, put it in your

350
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,680
food processor, and you want to, you

351
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
know, chop it up, pulse it up until it

352
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,880
has the texture, you know, finely

353
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,399
chopped like rice. And this is the

354
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,680
packaged version. Yeah. So, this takes a

355
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,200
little bit of work. You can buy it

356
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,200
already done. You can see it's very

357
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,040
similar. Yeah. Now, the benefit of doing

358
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,720
it yourself is you get finer bits. The

359
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,800
benefit of buying it is it's no work,

360
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
but also these pieces are a bit more

361
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,399
dried out. So, it actually has a more

362
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,839
rice-like texture when you cook it. I

363
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,880
like this, but it's there's nothing

364
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,399
added like some of the other products we

365
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,440
saw. No, it's just cauliflower. All

366
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,199
right. So, everyone associates

367
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,639
cauliflower rice with stir fry, but

368
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,959
there are many new innovative ways to do

369
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,560
it. So, I brought in a few experts, new

370
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,240
ways to cook cauliflower rice beyond

371
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,760
stir fry. Tina's going to start us off.

372
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,839
Sure. I have my uh saffron risoto.

373
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,040
Cauliflower risoto. Thank you. You be

374
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,440
the expert. Oh, nice. Oh, I was hoping

375
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,920
it's uh a family favorite. It's

376
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,680
wonderful. Yeah, it's um I I make it

377
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,240
just like a traditional risoto except I

378
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,199
use the cauliflower rice. I love that

379
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,639
it's low carb. Uh the creamy texture. My

380
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,839
kids love that. Still has that cream.

381
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,440
You buy a pre-made bag. You make it

382
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
yourself. I love the pre-made bag. I'm a

383
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
busy mom, so I don't always have time to

384
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,680
shred and chop, so the pre-made is

385
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,880
perfect. It tastes just like risotto.

386
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,240
Yeah. Thank you. Delicious. Thank you so

387
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,240
much. Congratulations, Tina. Thank you.

388
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,120
All right. Next up, I want to go visit

389
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,720
Robera who's visiting us from Skype. She

390
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,240
at home in her kitchen where she's

391
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,360
whipping up her favorite recipe using

392
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,120
cauliflower rice. What do you got for

393
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,440
us, Robera?

394
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,120
So, I have some amazing low carb tacos.

395
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,160
You will think of Taco Tuesday

396
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,279
differently, let me tell you. So, what

397
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,680
we're going to do is we're going to

398
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,199
start out with our lettuce cups, right?

399
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,160
Which you can get. You can also use

400
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,600
romaine lettuce. You take your meat,

401
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,360
which is this little guy, which is the

402
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,279
cauliflower, which look at that. It

403
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,440
looks exactly like ground meat. You're

404
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,600
going to top it off with some tomatoes

405
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,920
and avocados. And then you're going to

406
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,760
take a big bite and enjoy it. Oh my

407
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,920
goodness. Before you Before you bite,

408
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,120
would you ever go back to regular rice?

409
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:39,120
Yes or no? No. She's

410
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,959
in. All in. It's accurate. But what I

411
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,040
love about bag cauliflower rice is

412
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,639
you're starting with clean, pure base.

413
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,600
You can control the ingredients. It's

414
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,120
what we want out of avocado for a

415
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,639
product. And to your point, it's so easy

416
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,920
to mold it into so many recipes because

417
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,519
it can take on whatever flavor you

418
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,120
desire. That's it. Nicely done. As

419
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,320
always, you can check out the America's

420

childhood meal? What takes you right

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:06,080
back? Oh, capi emro scoop. Come again.

475
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,240
It was my non capleti ombroso and she

476
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,559
would put them in in h chicken broth and

477
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,960
it was the best chicken soup I've ever

478
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,760
had to this day. Sounds good. Love it.

479
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,679
Good job. Good.

480
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,640
All right. So, my mom was a terrible

481
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,160
cook. Sorry, mom.

482
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,160
What? And you're like a navy. No, she

483
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,160
knows she's a bad cook. She knows. All

484
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,000
of my childhood food memories, it's like

485
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,919
that looks delicious, mom. Maybe that

486
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
made you a chef. when she burned the

487
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,440
dinner, then we ordered pizza. So, it

488
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,120
was like pizza family fun night. So,

489
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,799
that's what I remember everybody having

490
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,640
just good pizza and laugh and good time.

491
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,480
I love it.

492
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,640
That's fun. What about you, Jeff? Um,

493
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,880
mine my mama would make she called it

494
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,080
American spaghetti. So, it was very sim.

495
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
We didn't have a lot of money growing

496
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,919
up, so it was it was a a can of just

497
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,200
tomato sauce, which it's the way that

498
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,720
she put the love into it, the ground

499
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,760
meat. It was really really good, and it

500
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,039
warms my heart. A Yes. Ours was red

501
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,720
sauce with spaghetti. Also, my

502
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,320
grandfather's from Staten Island, so we

503
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
had this family red sauce recipe that

504
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,559
would be on the pot Sundays for like 6

505
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,799
hours just swirling and swirling. You go

506
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,640
in there with that crusty bread. To this

507
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,320
day, the smell of garlic and oil cooking

508
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,320
in the kitchen is like it's the best.

509
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,960
That

510
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,400
feels It is the Italian. So good. I love

511
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
it. It's I love it, too. It makes And

512
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,480
it's also It brings everyone in.

513
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,080
Everyone's coming through the kitchen

514
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,919
then. And we've got I'm some from such a

515
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,360
big family. I love that feeling of the

516
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,440
party in the kitchen, which is this.

517
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,799
Yes. Yeah. That's what we do. You ready

518
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,320

519
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,320
some treats for you here in front of

520
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,320
you. But this is part of our hot dish,

521
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,640
okay? This is where we break down the

522
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,400
biggest food trends from the from around

523
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,840
Hollywood and the stories blowing up

524
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,039
your newsfeed, making you feel like

525
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,960
you're in the know about the whole world

526
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,480
of food. And since today is the retro

527
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,400
show, we're starting with a tweet from

528
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,559
Valerie. Uhoh. What I do now? She did

529
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,559
this about the new reboot of the movie A

530
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,000
Star Is Born. Yes. And then I realized

531
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,400
as I'm like uh gagaing over Lady Gaga,

532
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm like I could be old enough to um be

533
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,559
Lady Gaga's mom. And I'm okay with that,

534
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,720
by the way.

535
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,559
Well, ironically, the movie A Star is

536
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,160
Born with Gaga in it may not have

537
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,320
happened if it wasn't for a bowl of

538
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,919
pasta. Are you ready for this? So, Lady

539
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,600
Gaga was auditioning for this role, you

540
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,960
guys. And Bradley Cooper came over to

541
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,000
her home and was, you know, just

542
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,600
chatting with her, seeing if there was

543
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,280
chemistry. And apparently, she sent him

544
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
to the fridge to help himself to some

545
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,440
leftover pasta. And it was so good. He

546
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,679
said it may have actually helped her get

547
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,679
the gig.

548
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,400
The way to a man's tummy. I want to know

549
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,480
because I don't think anyone's actually

550
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,880
figured out what kind of pasta it was. I

551
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,799
agree. I'd love to know. Lady Gaga, if

552
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,320
you are watching, which I know you are.

553
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,919
Please let us know what you made, girl.

554
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,240
Was it a bowl of naysay? Like what was

555
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,919
it? We got to know. I agree. I want to

556
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,360
know. I want to know. Oh, I also want to

557
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,960
know. Is there have there ever been a

558
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,640
dish you've made that has like helped

559
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,480
you get your man to come around to your

560
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,200
side of things? I bet you I bet you know

561
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,039
the way to Eric's heart. Oh, I did. So,

562
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
we you know, we we started talking over

563
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,320
the phone. Someone set us up and after,

564
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,600
you know, four weeks of talking. He

565
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,000
invited himself to come meet me in

566
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,120
Nashville. So, I figured I needed a way

567
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,240
to win him over. So, I made him some

568
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:04,559
jumbolaya. And after that, we had a

569
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
bottle of wine. We had some jumbolaya.

570
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,840
And after the weekend, on the way to the

571
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
airport, he asked me to be his

572
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,400
girlfriend.

573
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,919
How spicy was that jumbolaya? I mean, I

574
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
mean, there's other parts to the story,

575
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,240
but I'm not going to tell you all

576
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,400
everything. Family show. No, not like

577
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,559
that.

578
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I love it. Well,

579
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,679
let's get Eric's side of the story,

580
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,720
don't you think? Okay, let's do let's

581
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,039
get him on FaceTime. Eric, verify that

582
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,720
the Jambalaya got you into it. Oh, wait.

583
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,000
Here we go. All right, we're going to

584
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,000
ask him what he thinks about this.

585
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,840
Y'all, this is crazy. Let's We're

586
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,559
actually going to

587
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,960
FaceTime. I get it. I want to

588
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,799
see. Let's see his face here.

589
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,799
Hey.

590
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,799
Hey.

591
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,799
[Laughter]

592
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,320
Look where I'm at, babe.

593
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:58,400
Wow. Beautiful girls. You're all so

594
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,240
young and pretty. Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm

595
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,120
telling him the story about the first

596
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,919
weekend we ever spent together.

597
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,919
What' you tell

598
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,159
the jumbo part only? Wait a minute. Just

599
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,679
the food. Stick to the mood. Eric, you

600
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:18,080
tell us your side. How'd it go down? Um,

601
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,440
well, as I recall it, she whined and

602
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,520
dined me. She had me stay

603
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,600
over. We had a little little veno. She

604
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,280
cooked me

605
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,640
jumbolaya. She had her apron on in the

606
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,880
kitchen. I can remember it vividly. And

607
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,240
um, being a northern boy, she sealed my

608
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,919
heart with some Cajun food.

609
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,480
That's how you do it. Yes.

610
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,080
I love it. Are the babies good? They're

611
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,960
just waking up, so it's a little chaotic

612
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:52,320
right now. Okay. I don't know. I love

613
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:54,480
you, baby. Thank you. So cute. Oh my

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,559

622
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,880
convincing their husband and or

623
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,640
boyfriend or anybody, it might just

624
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,080
happen in the form of these donuts. Are

Ready for this? Drunken donuts. What?

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,720
donuts? Food donuts. Donuts. I think

both have bourbon. Rosé, Irish cream,

633
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,720
bourbon. And these are all from the

634
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,720
doughnut project. Okay. I love their

635
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,440
stuff inside them. I think they taste

636
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,280
Oh. Oh, you got a Boston cream. Oh, you

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,880

Thank you. You know what I want us to

Okay. Yes, I do. It's true. No, I have

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,280
to laugh cuz I'm like, if you're going

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,280
to bring boozy donuts like to the

643
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,799
office, you may want to warn people and

644
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,159
let them know. No, don't tell them

645
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,840
anything.

646
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,039
really fun because like Barb in

647
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,280
accounting is going to be like twerking

648
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,360
on the copy machine and she's she might

00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,960

00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,159
Barb actually this is so I love you so

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,440
much for setting this up so perfectly

652
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,279
because the way that just the way that

653
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,360
you might want to send these donuts to

654
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,720
your office could just be with this

655
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,679
brand new service you guys that I've

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,600

clowns deliver your donuts if you would

659
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,640
like to. Look at this picture.

660
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,400
A new company allows you to send scary

661
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,400
clowns to deliver donuts to anyone that

662
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,760
you might like so that you can be both

663
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
if you're sending these boozy ones, you

664
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,919
can be fat, drunk, and scared all of the

665
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,279
time. No. No. So, is there anyone in

666
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,600
your life who would receive a scary

667
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:53,039
clown with donuts? Um, like a friend of

668
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,880
me accounting. I would never send it to

669
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,159
a friend.

670
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,159
Jesus. Oh my god.

671
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:09,279
No, don't do that. Wow. Donut.

672
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:12,080
Wow. You're crazy. No, I don't. Hi. Hi.

673
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,679
That's not some donuts. Oh, thank you.

674
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,960
All right. Don't do that. And don't

675
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,840
scare people. Is she going to get beat

676
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,120
with a box of donut? Don't do that.

677
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,679
Scared. We're going to go to break for a

678
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,360
second. Valerie Bur and Nelly's's brand

679
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,960
new twist on the chicken pot pie that

680
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,120
will make your taste buds go back to the

681
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,740
disco times. Okay, stay tuned. Where'd

682
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:52,600
he go? When he got that was so

683
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:54,880
[Music]

684
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,360
scary, we're back and we're asked in the

685
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,240
critical question. Are TV dinners a

686
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,919
thing again? Valerie was on the

687
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,840
everyone's favorite TV show of the 70s,

688
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,000
One Day at a Time. Thank you. Do Do you

689
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,600
remember these? I do. I love them. Love

690
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,279
them. It was so exciting. Did you get to

691
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,120
have those as a kid? We did. Not very

692
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,080
often, but this is before microwaves.

693
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,080
You had to actually put these in the

694
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,080
oven. 45 minutes later, it came out. So,

695
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,400
this is a little present from you. It's

696
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,480
the absolute least I could do. So, now

697
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,679
you got a new take on these TV TV

698
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,679
dinners. What do you got for us? I got a

699
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,360
chicken pot pie. Chicken pot pie all in

700
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,880
one pan. All right. While you make that,

701
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,320
while you make that audience, guess what

702
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,960
I've got? What are you doing with that?

703
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,760
I have Daphne's high school yearbook.

704
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,640
How did you get that? And childhood

705
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,159
photos. I'm going to holler if I find

706
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,360
anything interesting to share. And also

707
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,880
notes from all my Yes. It's full of

708
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,720
notes. Full of notes. Oh my gosh. Don't

709
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,200
read them. Valerie, enjoy yourself. I

710
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,679
will. Make it tasty. Do it good. I will.

711
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,440
All for you, Dr. Oz.

712
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,039
Okay. So, we're starting with basically,

713
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,559
you all know what is in a chicken pot

714
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,080
pie. I mean, you got, you know, your

715
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,679
veggies, usually peas, corn, everything,

716
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,919
but I've just played up a little bit

717
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,279
with it. I got some uh potatoes, and you

718
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,880
can use all frozen veggies if you want

719
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,880
to, and just heat them through. So, I

720
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,880
got potatoes, and there are some red

721
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,640
peppers in here, and some carrots, and

722
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,120
some mushrooms, and we got some eric

723
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,880
vert, or green beans, really. They're

724
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,919
just green beans. Green beans. And we

725
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,520
got some peas. And we got some garlic.

726
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,960
So, all that goes in. Little chili

727
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,400
flake. A little chili flake. I always

728
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,400
like to heat things up a little bit.

729
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,720
Yeah, cuz you're so spicy, though. You a

730
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,159
lot. So, we just get those all blended

731
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,760
together. Chicken in. Chicken in,

732
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,279
please. Chicken in. Okay. So, then we

733
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,760
got a little basically some bashameal

734
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,720
sauce here, which is flour and oil and

735
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,320
um there's some cream in here. And

736
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,240
again, I like things spicy, so I got a

737
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,880
little hot sauce in here. Love it. So,

738
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,279
that goes on top of this. Get it all

739
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,520
mixed together. It smells so And then it

740
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,080
ends up looking like this, right? Yep.

741
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,320
And again, I want your life to be easy.

742
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,640
So, we have some pie dough that you get

743
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,480
get right in the fridge. One of the best

744
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,640
tricks ever. That's the best. Don't make

745
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,320
your

746
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,120
own. I agree. We never do. Just roll it

747
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,559
right over. So easy.

748
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,360
And this is where all the homemade

749
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,120
happens. So, you know, and it looks not

750
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,640
in. But here's the deal. If you want to

751
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,640
get all fancy and crimp it, you can get

752
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,000
all fancy and crimp it. And then that's

753
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,480
going to go in the oven. And then

754
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,200
what comes out? Oh, let's see. All in

755
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,919
one. Moment of truth. All right. Yes.

756
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,520
Look at that. Oh, that's gorgeous. Oh my

757
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,200
goodness. And it looks so beautiful and

758
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,960
homemade. And you use a lot of

759
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,440
ingredients just from the grocery store.

760
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,640
I love that. So good. All right, we got

761
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,120
to dive in on this. Let's talk about it.

762
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,320
We've made Wait, wait, wait. Oh, okay.

763
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,600

764
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,399
this flaky crust. Ready? Are you

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,919
watching this? Watch it flake apart.

766
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,840
Look at that. Okay, we can't tease the

767
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,000
audience without giving them some. Oh,

768
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,279

gosh. So good. Oh wow. Oh

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,240
my gosh. And I have I have no idea why

789
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,520
my mother decided me to put it in a

790
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,720
cowgirl outfit. So it's amazing I'm not

791
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,080
in therapy. I don't know why she dressed

792
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,159
me like that. I don't have no idea that

793
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
I've got I've got Daffh's retro photo

794
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,320
here, which the audience has been

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,799
adoring. There it is. Look at that.

796
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,000
There's a clown. She's with a clown. She

797
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,840
She didn't like that food. You didn't

798
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,080
like the clown back then either. There

799
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,080
she is.

800
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,760
Now, now I need to go to therapy. You

801
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,120
just want to know if Valerie still has

802
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,880
the bell bottoms from back in the day.

803
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,039
Oh, come on. I'd love to borrow those. I

804
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,960
don't think I do. You You got rid of No,

805
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,480
but I have new ones. Bell Bottoms are

806
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,039
always in as far as I'm concerned. Oh,

807
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,039
yes, they are. Valerie, uh, you know

808
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,559
what I do have, though? You know what I

809
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,240
do have is I still have the Elton John

810
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,640
boots. I wore in the Elton John episode

811
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,399
of One Day at a Time where we sang. Oh

812
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,600
wow, that was fun. You're going to have

813
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,279
to bring those in sometime. I still have

814
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,399
the boots. We're going to wear those.

815
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,159
And of course, you got to act with

816
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,159
everyone's childhood crush. Someone like

817
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,039
Sean Cassidy says, "Yes, in Hearty

818
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,080
Boys." Who was the best kisser? I want

819
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,399
to know. Oh, kiss and tell. A girl never

820
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,159
tells. Oh, you got to tell. But a woman

821
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,240
does. I don't remember. I kissed a lot

822
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,480
of boys.

823
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,919
But not no not like Valerie, but as

824
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,799
characters. As of course I I'm a serial

825
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,960
monogamist. A so that's fun. Yeah,

that's the right way to go. Yeah, seem

827
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,399
to work out pretty well. This pot pie

828
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,000
also seem to work out really well. This

829
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,960

835
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,120
for a walk down memory lane with a

836
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,480
southern classic using ingredients you

837
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,480
already have in your pants. Don't go

838
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,480

Why do you think he would fake having

Down syndrome? How one man faked a

844
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,240
disability. You're doing a job to help

845
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,240
someone and you're taking advantage of

846
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,799
for his own twisted pleasure. Changing

847
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,440

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,640
sauce. Good, good, good. So, this is

889
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,000
just stuff in your pantry. You just

890
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,039
throw it in there. So, here's the thing.

891
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,519
My mama always says, "Have tons of cans

892
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,679
of vegetables in your pantry and have

893
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,279
frozen meat. That way you can always

894
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,600
whip something up last minute. I've got

895
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,279
three kids under four and a husband that

896
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,039
works. Sometimes sometimes your mom is

897
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,240
very smart. My mama is smart. So

898
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,679
sometimes you just need something you

899
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,200
can whip up like that to feed your

900
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,720
family. All right. And we got to add a

901
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,200
little spice in that mix. Yes, we are

902
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,679
adding some spice. Add some spice. But I

903
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,120
want to learn more about all of it. How

904
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,120
much? Just a little pinch. Just a little

905
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,640
pinch. Little dab will do. I want to

906
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,399
know a little bit more about your Yeah.

907
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,159
What is this? Oh, sorry. So this is

908
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,600
chili. We've got cumin. We've got a

909
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,360
little garlic powder. And we got a

910
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,120
little Cajun seasoning cuz I put Cajun

911
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,760
seasoning on everything. So, two

912
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,080
questions. Seriously, you said 10 cans.

913
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,159
Nine and 10 aren't used. So, not just

914
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,760
really 10 cans, not 10 cans. Well,

915
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,880
here's the thing. Two were not used

916
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,399
because sometimes you might want to

917
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,359
double up your corn and sometimes you

918
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,040
might want to double up your green

919
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,960
beans. Whatever you want. All right. So,

920
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,760
we got some retro home video, Daffy,

921
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,879
don't we? Oh, let me see. We do. We do.

922
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,480
I was going to say your mama learned

923
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,760
this from her mama. She did. And your

924
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,040
your grandma. We got a little retro

925
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,240
video of you cooking with her. Take a

926
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,240
look at this. Oh yeah.

927
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,599
Work great.

928
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,960
You're working hard. Working hard. Let's

929
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,560
turn it right around. Let's turn it

930
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,560
around now. Work. Hurry up.

931
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:49,919
[Applause]

932
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,320
Oh god. I love it. Love it. It's just

933
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,560
it's sweet cuz that's my my mama Mary M

934
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,480
Mary Baglio and she passed but she

935
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,320
taught my mama how to cook and she

936
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,839
taught her daughter and my mama and so

937
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,359
that was me making homemade Italian

938
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,200
bread when we were in Louisiana

939
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,119
together. So it's just I haven't seen

940
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,880
that in a really long time. She would be

941
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,320
so proud of you what you're doing like

942
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,320
you're making her proud. But that's the

943
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,640
beauty of recipes that does it it gives

944
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,480
you your family heritage. Oh, it totally

945
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,079
it totally does.

946
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,760
All right. Will you all stop crying?

947
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,920
We're making There's no crying

948
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,440
while we're making. Oh, yeah. Pull

949
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,950
yourself together. Make your mama cry.

950
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,680
Chili. I know. So,

951
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,440
[Laughter]

952
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,839
well, while she's adding tears to her

953
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,520
chili. Um, what's going to sweeten this

954
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,520
up for us? Yes, cuz we've got super

955
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,040
spicy over there. So, I'm bringing the

956
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,480
southern sweet cuz I'm southern and

957
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,400
Caribbean. So, I bring the southern

958
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,200
sweet and Caribbean heat on any given

959
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
day. You don't know what you're going to

960
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,079
get with it. Oh, I like that. That's

961
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,839
your tag. Yes. Caribbean heat and

962
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,160
southern sweet. I love that. Yes. So, I

963
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,839
am making some sweet honey butter

964
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,599
cornbread. And if you say it with a

965
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,680
southern accent, it just makes it even

966
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,440
better. So, we're doing sweet honey

967
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,280
butter cornbread. All right. So, we have

968
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,040
the basic cornbread mix. We're doing the

969
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,359
dry mix first. So, it's allpurpose

970
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,800
flour. We have baking powder, salt,

971
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,760
sugar, of course, cuz I love sweet

972
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,440
cornbread. You guys love sweet

973
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,400
cornbread. I like it anyway. I'll take

974
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,079
it. And we got a little baking powder.

975
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,160
Okay. So, we have our dry going.

976
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,280
Daffhany has beat our our eggs. And then

977
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,880
we will add in I love your eggs. Oh yes,

978
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,440
she is just going to town on these eggs.

979
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,960
We have some milk going in. Vegetable

980
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,560
oil

981
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,040
and melted butter if you don't have

982
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,960
that. Yes, melted butter. We got to have

983
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,560
butter with a All right. Who stole my

984
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,119
butter? Did we knock our butter out?

985
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,160
Valerie, did you steal my Dr. Oz? You

986
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,280
stole my butter. I thought you had

987
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,760
enough butter already in there. What?

988
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,440
It's really good. All right. Well, if

989
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,520
Dr. Oz doesn't steal your butter, you'll

990
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,880
add in some melted butter. And then I

991
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,720
add in, you got to have the honey for

992
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,240
the sweetness, extra sweetness in there.

993
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,400
So we'll mix that all together. We have

994
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,560
wet going and then we have our dry mix.

995
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,800
We put the two together. And then I like

996
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,200
to pour it into a cast iron skillet cuz

997
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,640
when we were doing the best cast iron

998
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,079
skillet, it doesn't have to be hot. You

999
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,520
want to spray the inside first or you

1000
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,280
can add a little butter around the edge

1001
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,640
there. Not if he's around though. He

1002
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,160
takes your butter if you will. All

1003
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,880
right. So we will bake that off in the

1004
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,720
oven at 350°. And you can see it already

1005
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,520
looks delicious cuz he's eating it. Come

1006
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,280
on over. We got Jesse's chili here.

1007
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,480
Cornbread. Come join us. I tell you, you

1008
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,839
don't need that butter. This stuff is so

1009
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,480
good today. It's sweet and sour all

1010
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:20,240
together with little tears inside. It's

1011
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,680
It's special. Oh, this is so good. You

1012
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,440
name it after your mom. Is that right?

1013
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,280
My mama is the one that taught me how to

1014
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,560
cook. And so chili and um jumbolaya,

1015
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,000
those are some of the few things she

1016
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,680
taught me in right in the beginning cuz

1017
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,599
my mom is an amazing cook. So I wanted

1018
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,920
to be just like her. Well, guess what?

1019
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,800
We got it. Guess what? We got her here.

1020
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,800
We got her here today. Come on up with

1021
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Parker.

1022
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,920

1023
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,920

00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,079

your body double.

1026
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,720
We're like sisters. I am here to tell

1027
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,200
you this girl has been cooking since she

1028
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,200
was in diapers. She was born to

1029
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:20,320
Kd for

1030
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,800
mama. We're going to hang out with Mama

1031
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,560
Parker. You guys can find these recipes

1032
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,520

dr.com/theish and all of our sharable

1034

picss and step by steps or on Instagram

1035
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,000
at the dish on Oz. When we come back,

1036
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,880
I'm making fun fondue fun again with a

1037
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,880
healthy spin. Don't go away.

1038
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm so glad you

1039
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,920
were. You came. This isn't me.

1040
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,240
Why do you think he would fake having

1041
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,240
Down syndrome? How one man faked a

1042
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,839
disability. You're doing a job to help

1043
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,839
someone and you're taking advantage of

1044
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,400
for his own twisted pleasure. Changing

1045
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,010
his diaper. It's just gross. That's

1046
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:03,599
coming up tomorrow.

1047
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:04,960
[Music]

1048
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,520
We are back with the dish crew and

1049
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,800
another retro food. So, what is it? So,

1050
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,200
here's the deal. Daffhne actually thinks

1051
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,839
her dad is really cheesy, so this is

1052
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,839
perfect. Perfect.

1053
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,680
He sets me up sometimes. Um, yeah, I do

1054
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,440
think you're a little cheesy every once

1055
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,760
in a while, but informative and and

1056
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,359
really lovable, but still cheesy. A

1057
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,839
little well only as cheesy as this

1058
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,760
fondue which is mostly cheese. Um so

1059
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,240
this is made a really basic cheese

1060
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,760
sauce. Okay this is garlic cooked with a

1061
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,680
little bit of butter or oil a little bit

1062
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,599
of flour adding a whole bunch of cheese

1063
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,440
and of course the wine wine or beer is

1064
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,839
what makes fond do gives it that

1065
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,200
delicious you know sort of acid flavor

1066
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,800
too and of course it's really just a

1067
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,480
delicious pot of cheese and then I make

1068
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,960
it a little bit healthier is

1069
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,560
patronizing me. I'm going to put a whole

1070
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,760
like Popeye's whole serving of If I

1071
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,119
wasn't here, would you do that? Probably

1072
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,359
not. No. You know what? I like this. I'm

1073
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,960
sort of doing a fondue spin on on art um

1074
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,839
a spinach artich choke dip. And

1075
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,280
actually, my favorite brilliant. That's

1076
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,400
that's what I get at the That's what I

1077
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,280
get at the restaurant when I'm like, you

1078
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,400
know, let's be a little healthy. Let's

1079
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,920
let's And then if you're intimidated by

1080
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,200
artichokes or you haven't made them a

1081
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,040
lot at home, we actually have a really

1082
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,320
fun little video Instagram story here to

1083
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,760
show you. Here's how you're going to

1084
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,960
steam your artich chokes. Okay, you take

1085
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,800
off the uh the utmost stems and leaves.

1086
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,320
So you take off that top pointy stem

1087
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,760
right there. Top pointy leaves right

1088
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,520
there. And then you're going to flip it

1089
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,119
around and take off the end of the stem

1090
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,040
also because that's a really woody part.

1091
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,359
Leaving just a bit at the end. You take

1092
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,040
a spoon and scoop out the choke. Okay,

1093
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,839
that's the hairy part in the middle of

1094
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,880
it. This is a really easy technique um

1095
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,920
just to make sure you don't have to

1096
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,440
worry about it after it cooks. You

1097
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,960
sprinkle a little water in a little

1098
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,119
lemon into your water and then steam

1099
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,320
these artichokes up. Okay. And the

1100
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,320
lemon's going to keep them from turning

1101
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,640
brown, which is great. And voila, you

1102
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,320
have these great artichokes. And what I

1103
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,000
did was I actually cut the stems up. I

1104
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,200
love I do this in my stuffed in my

1105
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,560
stuffed artich chokes, too. I throw

1106
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,480
these in with the breadcrumbs. So,

1107
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,160
chopped up stems of the artichokes. No

1108
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,440
waste. That's right. And then I cubed up

1109
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,760
the steamed artich chokes and put them

1110
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,599
on this little platter. Get in there.

1111
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,440
Little hunks of bread, some boiled

1112
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,280
tomato, some boiled potatoes. So, it's

1113
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,040
kind of like a reclet there. Okay. So,

1114
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,319
Valerie, why is it called the choke? You

1115
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,839
heard that word? Because those little

1116
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,839
the things inside the middle, all the

1117
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,680
purple parts, you can choke on them. You

1118
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,000
choke on them. Is that true? It's true.

1119
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,079
It's absolutely true.

1120
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,599
I like that.

1121
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,359
What's going on down there, Jamaica? All

1122
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,440
right. So, uh, we're going to play a fun

1123
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,680
game. You guys up for a game? Yes. Yes.

1124
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,200
It's a retro throwback. It's called

1125
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,480
Never Have I Ever. Have you played that?

1126
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,160
I would love this game. All right. So,

1127
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,520
if you haven't played it, All right. So,

1128
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,800
I'm going to pull out a question. And

1129
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,480
we're playing it foodie style. So, it's

1130
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,839
food questions. And if you've done it

1131
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,319
before, you're going to take a little

1132
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,599
sip. Okay. All right. So, I'm gonna call

1133
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,640
you out. Kind of weird to play this game

1134
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,079
with my dad. I'm not going to lie. All

1135
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,200
right. No, it's I'm watching carefully.

1136
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,880
All right. So, never have I ever eaten

1137
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,280
something out of the trash.

1138
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,640
I have. And it was a donut I threw away.

1139
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,400
Like, I want to be skinny and then I was

1140
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,079
like, "Give me my donut back." So, yes,

1141
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,079
I did do it. We've all been there. I did

1142
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,200
it. We've all been there. Don't judge

1143
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,319
me. All right. Don't you hate when you

1144
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,079
accidentally throw the cookie out with

1145
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,839
the tin foil or you're like, "No, no,

1146
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,160
you got a fish back for that cookie."

1147
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:14,880
Okay. No shame in my game. Okay. Never

1148
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,640
have I ever tried breast milk. Oh, no. I

1149
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,440
haven't done that. Isn't that why you

1150
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,720
try breast milk first? You know, you

1151
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,000
want to make sure it tastes good for

1152
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,040
your baby obviously before. Have you

1153
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,560
never tried it? And it's just kind of

1154
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,839
interesting. It's a novelty. Hey,

1155
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,880

1156
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,440
