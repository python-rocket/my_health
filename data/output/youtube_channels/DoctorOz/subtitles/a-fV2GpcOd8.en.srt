1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,440
Actor Shannon Gardy is no stranger to

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,759
the spotlight. Since she was 10 years

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,160
old, she's had a successful career on TV

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,960
and in films. But now, the actress is

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,279
starring in her own real life medical

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,359
drama as she faces a health

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:22,560
crisis. At age seven, Shannon Dar moved

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,519
from Memphis to Hollywood. By 10, she

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,680
was a working actress. At 11, she

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,400
captured a winning role and America's

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,960
attention as the courageous Jenny Wilder

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,280
on Little House on the Prairie. Her

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
stardom was solidified when legendary

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,480
producer Aaron Spelling cast her as the

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,000
boisterous Brenda Walsh on the smash hit

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,600
90210. Spelling and Shannon combined

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,760
forces again for the hit series Charmed.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,840
Since then, Shannon has enjoyed a

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,800
charmed Hollywood life, working as an

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,920
actress, producer, and director, and

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,640
finding lasting love with husband Kirk

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,159
Israeno. Then, in 2015, the press leaked

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,840
devastating news that the actress later

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,159
confirmed. Shannon Doerty was battling

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,159
breast

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,159
cancer. Please welcome Shannon Doy.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,479
I'm so happy you're here. Thank you. All

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,560
right. You're 44 years old.

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,799
Life's going well. Yeah. Charmed as we

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,240
were saying, right? And you hear those

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,439
fateful words, you have cancer. Yeah.

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,360
Where were you? What went through your

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,960
mind? Um, I was in a car driving on PCH

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,560
back to my house. My mom was actually

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,840
driving. I was in the passenger side.

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,640
And the doctor called me and he told me

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,479
that. And all I could think

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,399
was, how do I tell my family? you know,

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,840
how are they gonna deal with it? It was

40
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,640
um you know, you worry most about the

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,360
people that you love and about making

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,320
sure that they're going to be

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:02:00,399
okay. So, I'm already going to

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,399
cry. So, for me, that was the hardest

45
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,159
part. My husband told me, he goes, "Just

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,280
think of everybody in their

47
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,599
underwear." So, you're all in your

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,520
underwear right

49
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,040
now. K Kurt, her husband, is joining us,

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,120
by the way. He's in the audience.

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
I I know this is difficult. Uh we sat

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,480
down about a month ago and talked

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,760
privately and and I know how passionate

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,599
you are about your story being helpful

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
to women all over the country. Yeah.

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,360
Whether it's a cancer diagnosis or

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,879
anything else. And you're so insightful.

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,239
So, I'm going to have you if you walk

59
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,920
you, you know, our audience through

60
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,920
what's going on in your life. Okay. Was

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,480
there a family history of breast cancer?

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,599
Um it was on my father's side. His mom

63
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,360
had uh cancer, breast cancer and uh

64
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:51,120
emphyma I think. Um but nothing my my

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,440
mom's side is healthy as can be. And you

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,000
discovered the lump yourself. Yes. How

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,560
did that happen? Uh, I was in the shower

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,159
and um I felt something a little odd and

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,680
um and you know a million different

70
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,000
scenarios go through your head at the

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,159
time. You you know you compare yourself

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,239
to your dog and you're like oh well he

73
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,959
has like a fatty cyst here. I'm like

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,519
Leroy. Everything's fine. You know I

75
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,920
mean your head goes into into all sorts

76
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,360
of different places. Um, and then and

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,959
then reality comes in and you're like,

78
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,080
"Ah, I should probably get this checked

79
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,720
out." And and did you um un you know,

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,040
unfortunately I was with uh business

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,159
managers at the time. Um and they um

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,360
they as business managers do you you pay

83
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,599
them 5% of every single dime that you

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,959
make and they go you do nothing. You

85
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,560
don't even know where your bank accounts

86
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,840
are. you know, for the most part, they I

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,640
mean, they literally take over your

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
life. And so, their job is to pay your

89
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,480
health insurance, to pay your mortgages

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,680
on time, to pay your Verizon bill, to

91
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,599
make sure your AT&T bill is paid. Um, to

92
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,640
make sure your taxes are paid. Like, I

93
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,239
mean, that's their job. Um, and for 5%

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,879
you really hope that they're doing that

95
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,280
job because that's a lot of money. Um,

96
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,920
and I found out that they had not in

97
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,159
fact paid my health

98
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,280
insurance. Um, yeah. And you know,

99
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,919
timing wise, it was past being eligible

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,560
for other sorts of insurance. So I I I

101
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,840
didn't I didn't go to the doctor when

102
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,080
when I needed to.

103
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,160
So you delayed seeing the doctor? Yes.

104
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,759
Knowing there's a lump in there. Yes.

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,440
That is something that women all over

106
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,199
the country are struggling with right

107
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,759
now. Yeah. What's that like? The

108
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,280
powerlessness of that. Um, I mean it's

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,320
pretty frightening and all I can say is,

110
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,199
you know, go go like because you have no

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,199
idea what that extra time might have

112
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
might have afforded you and and usually

113
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,400
what it is is that like mine for

114
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,720
instance spread to a lymph node and or

115
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,280
two

116
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,520
and you know it might not have spread.

117
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,280
There's a really strong possibility it

118
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,880
wouldn't have spread. So I think

119
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,199
obviously as you know as a doctor the

120
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,520
most important thing is catching it as

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,160
early as humanly possible. So when you

122
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,560
finally get to the doctor's office and

123
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,039
they start examining you treating you

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,639
horrible.

125
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,960
Horrible. What did they tell you? You

126
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,759
know I'm actually very shy like and

127
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,600
modest as my husband will attest. And so

128
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,840
to have all these people like touching

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,080
my breast is really uncomfortable. And

130
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,320
um I don't know if there's any breast

131
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,320
cancer survivors. Actually, this whole

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,560
audience is breast cancer. Oh, I love

133
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,560
you

134
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,360
guys. Oh, it's

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,759
amazing. You're all gorgeous, by the

136
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,360
way. You're beautiful and and I'm dying

137
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,400
to hear your story at some point as

138
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,919
well. But it's it's horrible. You know,

139
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,919
you're you're in there and then it's the

140
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,600
waiting for the results and you're like,

141
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,600
"Okay." And they do the mammogram and

142
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,080
they're like, "This doesn't look so

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,320
good." And we think that, you know, we

144
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,840
think that we should do a biopsy and in

145
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,800
your head you're like, "God, this is

146
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,560
this is turning all bad and how is this

147
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,319
happening to me?" To me, you know,

148
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,280
that's what you say to yourself, right?

149
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,479
And I always thought that I was I'm in

150
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,600
the middle of writing a book about my

151
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,720
experience and and and in it I say that,

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,280
you know, I was Superman. Like I thought

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,600
my body was so strong. I felt like and

154
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,520
nothing nothing could touch me. And now

155
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,360
I feel like like a lemon, like a car

156
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,720
that's a lemon. And you're like, how can

157
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,520
I return it back to the dealership and

158
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,039
get a new one? Um, and you do you just

159
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,479
kind of feel like how where did I go

160
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,280
wrong? And how am I how did I fail? You

161
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,960
went one step beyond at everything you

162
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,240
did in your whole life, but especially

163
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,759
now. Right. So when you got the

164
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,600
diagnosis, you started looking for other

165
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,919
approaches, different therapies. Yes.

166
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,240
walk us through what was good, what was

167
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,520
bad, what was ugly. Well, I mean, first

168
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,919
off, I think doctors are phenomenal and

169
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,080
um I love my doctors at Cedars. I think

170
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:13,199
they're great. Um but I think that often

171
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,039
times what we do as patients is we just

172
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,800
accept what they say and we go, "Oh god,

173
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
they know everything, so we're just

174
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,560
going to go along with this." So they're

175
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,639
like, "You need to take both off." Okay,

176
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,639
sure. or you need to do this or you need

177
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,440
to do this kind of chemo. And I think

178
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,840
that it's it's very important to

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,280
question it. Yeah. To constantly sort of

180
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,039
look at them and question and say, well,

181
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,280
but why? And is there an alternative?

182
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,960
And and if I stay on medicine a little

183
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,880
bit longer, is that going to change

184
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,599
maybe the kind of surgery that I have to

185
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,599
have? And um you know, why do I have to

186
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,759
have radiation because it's so damaging

187
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,479
to your body? Or you know, what are the

188
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,360
different forms of chemo? and have we

189
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,280
tested me to see which chemo will work

190
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,759
for me? And then there's the alternative

191
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,319
medicine. There's vitamin C injections.

192
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,879
I don't know if you guys did any of

193
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:06,400
those, but um you you you did that.

194
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,800
Yeah. Vitamin C IVs um which are

195
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,520
phenomenal for you. I don't think they

196
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,440
cure cancer, but they're phenomenal. I

197
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,639
mean, it's vitamins being injected into

198
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,800
your body. And um and you research a lot

199
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,720
of stuff. If you research these clinics

200
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,560
in Mexico that claim to cure you. Yeah,

201
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
you guys know those. Huh? Um, did you go

202
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,960
there, too? No. God, no. No, no, no. I

203
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,840
didn't know. Uh, I drew the line at

204
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,640
going to Mexico. Um, but you're already

205
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,839
so overwhelmed with the decisions you're

206
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,240
having to make and with your own

207
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,760
research. And this sort of comes at you

208
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,320
and it's even more overwhelming. you

209
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,200
kind of what I did is I buried my head

210
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,480
in the sand and just sort of tuned

211
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,839
everybody out and kind of figured out

212
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,160
what felt right for me and obviously

213
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,000
with a lot of prayer as well. So what

214
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,080
did you do? Is the mass still in your

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,600
breast? Yes. So I have not had surgery

216
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,839
yet. um my oncologist felt that we

217
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
should give this sort of an opportunity

218
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,200
this medicine protocol to see if it

219
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,959
would shrink uh the tumor and it's also

220
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,360
known to it sort of cuts off all your

221
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,519
estrogen. So my particular tumor is is

222
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,279
estrogen. It's all fed by estrogen. So

223
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,360
the minute that they they cut it off,

224
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,519
it's sort of like okay, you know, pretty

225
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,360
sure it won't spread at this point. Um,

226
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,560
and then you hope that that the protocol

227
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,800
you're on actually shrinks the tumor so

228
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,000
that again you have more

229
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,440
options, you know, down the road for

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
surgery. Do you think your doctors

231
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,279
wanted to wait as long as you've waited?

232
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,880
No. Does it make does it make you

233
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,760
nervous that the the tumor is still in

234
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:50,880
there? No. Um because I feel like I

235
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,160
needed to be ready and I needed first,

236
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,320
second, third opinions and I I didn't

237
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,279
want to look back after surgery and say,

238
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,440
"Wow, I wish I had done this instead."

239
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,720
When we come back, I love you. Why

240
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,920
Shannon waited to have her cancer

241
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600
removed? The other thing she's tried.

242
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,440
Stay with us. What do you remember about

243
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
shooting that episode from That was

244
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,480
Beverly Hills 90210 by the way. was the

245
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,079
first time in a teen show aimed show

246
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,160
that breast cancer was part of the

247
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,320
story. Yeah. I felt um I felt a profound

248
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,560
sense of responsibility.

249
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
Are you struck now by how life is in a

250
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,959
patriarch? I mean that's too close.

251
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,440
Yeah. Yeah. I mean I wish I had Brenda's

252
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:33,120
outcome as opposed to mine. But, you

253
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,839
know, I think that at this point, I just

254
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,360
hope that I can help any woman who's

255
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,360
going through it and make her realize

256
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,640
that like I'm right there with you, you

257
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,399
know, and we can all go through it

258
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,480
together.

259
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,839
So, my medical unit called Shannon's

260
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
oncologist who told us Shannon's

261
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,920
specific cancer is an estrogen positive

262
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,560
invasive ductal, which is a very, very

263
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,959
common yes, form and it feeds off

264
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,480
estrogen. So, in order to help, you try

265
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,959
to turn off estrogen because it makes

266
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,200
tumor lip get larger. I know that your

267
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,720
doctors are very nervous about you

268
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,560
stalling the surgery. I'm going to use

269
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,800
the word stall because you've gotten a

270
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,079
lot of opinions now. What have you been

271
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,760
doing in the meantime? And just walk us

272
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,680
through in some detail the therapies

273
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,200
that they're giving you. So, I get a

274
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,880
Lupron shot once a month and uh which is

275
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,959
just not pleasant because you

276
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,440
emotionally for the first couple hours,

277
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,920
days, week, uh you're a little, you

278
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,399
know, off I would say. Um, or shut your

279
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,480
ovaries down. Yes. So, I mean, I guess

280
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,959
that was sort of the hardest part for me

281
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,680
of going on this protocol is because I'm

282
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,920
44 and my husband and I wanted children.

283
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,519
So, you go on Lupron and you instantly

284
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,279
go into menopause. Well, 2 months later,

285
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,720
you're in menopause. Um, and but you

286
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,680
know, you have to make choices in life

287
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,440
sometimes. And, uh, you know, maybe that

288
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,920
just means that we adopt and we're

289
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,279
supposed to be those people that, you

290
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,640
know, provide a home for a child who

291
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,040
doesn't have one. Um,

292
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,519
you very good at that. Yeah, thank you.

293
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,600
I think so too. And then I take another

294
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,360
pill which I cannot pronounce. It's

295
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,959
okay. So, the big question. Mhm. This is

296
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,360
our last conversation ended without an

297
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,279
answer to this. Have you decided to have

298
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,760
a surgery? Yes. You have? Yes. Oh, God.

299
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,519
Yeah.

300
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,600
And what type of surgery are you going

301
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,079
to have? Have you decided that yet? Um,

302
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,519
I haven't. It's between two of them and

303
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,440
at the end of the day it'll be up to my

304
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,160
doctor and it could, you know, change

305
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,880
the last minute. Uh I'm I'm actually

306
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,160
going to a center

307
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,320
um that you know of very well and uh

308
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,000
just to sort of get their general

309
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,480
opinion. Good. Good. And then I head

310
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,639
back to LA and instantly sort of go in

311
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,160
with my doctors and they, you know, I'm

312
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,760
like, you guys make the final decision.

313
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,360
What what would you do if it was your

314
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,959
wife? What would you do if it was your

315
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,279
daughter? And ultimately that's I I you

316
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,600
know I whatever they're just breasts

317
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:03,200
right um I mean I love them mine mine

318
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,760
but you know and everybody's really

319
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,680
they're beautiful and but you know in

320
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,760
the grand scheme of things they're just

321
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,840
not I would rather be alive and I would

322
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,680
rather grow old with my

323
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,160
[Applause]

324
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,519
husband. I I get the fear uh it's

325
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,800
different for women I think when they

326
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,720
sense their breasts which are part of

327
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,880
who they defined by. I mentioned that

328
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,720
the audience is filled with women who've

329
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,880
already been through this because I

330
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,360
thought as much as you're helping them,

331
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,200
they might be able to help you. So, if

332
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,880
it's okay, I'm going to have them just

333
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,480
say a few words from their heart. I

334
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
haven't scripted this, but we'll hear

335
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,000
from them. And I I don't know who wants

336
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,200
to go first. Uh, everyone who has had

337
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,200
breast catch, please stand up in the

338
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,519
audience. And maybe you want to go

339
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,720
first. Words of wisdom. Something that

340
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,079
might help Shannon, something that

341
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,079
helped you. Hi. Hi.

342
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,560
Your tears, I think, have brought all of

343
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:02,440
us to tears because we've been in your

344
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:07,730
shoes recently. Um, and we all came for

345
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:10,960
you. Literally came here for you today.

346
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,960
[Music]

347
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,000
You guys are amazing.

348
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:24,160
You're killing me today. We knew about

349
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,040
you coming and we came here for you.

350
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,720
There will be women watching. Yeah. Who

351
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,360
will hear you and listen to your words

352
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,800
and be their own best advocate. And you

353
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,740
I promise you will have saved lives

354
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,799
today during this. Oh my god. Thank you.

355
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,799
[Music]

356
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,480
How are you? I'm good. How are you

357

doing? I'm doing well. You got Thank

358
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,720
you.

359
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,839
I wanted to talk to you today about a

360
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,199
mistctomy because the biggest

361
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,199
misconception about a mistctomy is that

362
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,279
you're no longer beautiful anymore and

363
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,279
you're no longer a real woman. But I'm

364
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,440
here to tell you, these women are here

365
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,240
to tell you that you are a real woman.

366
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,720
That you are beautiful after your mctomy

367
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,240
if that's what you choose to do. Well, I

368
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
can tell you that you're gorgeous, so I

369
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,920
believe every word of love. Thank you so

370
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,399
much. You all are. Thank you. And

371
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,839
there's life after a mistctomy. There's

372
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,839
a living life after a mistctomy.

373
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,880
You can tell why you guys are survivors.

374
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,320
God bless you for all being here today.

375
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,600
All right. Coming up, how breast cancer

376
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,519
affects Shannon's family. We're going to

377
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
meet her husband Kurt. Stay with us.

378
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,560
We're back with Shannon Dy and her

379
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,199
husband Kurt, who's now joining us in

380
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,040
the audience. Shannon just announced

381
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,880
that she's battling breast cancer. Kurt,

382
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,519
when someone you love is going through

383
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,440
something like cancer, it affects the

384
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,240
whole family. How's it been with for

385
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,920
you, how you been handling this? Um, you

386
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,440
know, it's that when when this kind of

387
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,040
thing happens that, you know, the thing

388
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,519
that you can't help is that it changes

389
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,839
you. That um you have you have no choice

390
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,000
in that, but the it's how it changes you

391
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,639
that you can kind of deal with. So, I

392
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,959
think with us, it's um brought us much

393
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,560
closer together. Um, it's one of those

394
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,199
times where you you you get to test your

395
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,279
metal as a as a married couple. He loves

396
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,639
you a lot.

397
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,639
Yeah. He's trying very hard not to cry.

398
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,320
So, when you go public about any health

399
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,320
issue, but especially in cancer, it can

400
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,040
affect the way people perceive you. Yes.

401
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,600
How's it affected your career?

402
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,600
um it's affected it because you do you

403
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,680
do change a little bit while you're on

404
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,000
the medicine and everything else and you

405
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,600
do get you know you gain weight and

406
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,480
there's nothing that you can do about it

407
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,800
and you do get puffy and I think I think

408
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,880
that that all affects a career like mine

409
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,959
that's not only based on talent but it's

410
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,800
so much based on sort of the superficial

411
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,120
shell that that is right here and so it

412
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,279
it it has affected it and you know I've

413
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,440
been lucky I like a director that adores

414
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,839
me and hires me for a lot of stuff and

415
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,839
another director like Kevin Smith, but

416
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
you know th those are few and far

417
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,600
between. I think that most people are

418
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,120
usually like, "Oh god, is she okay?" You

419
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,199
know, what's the stress like dealing

420
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,120
with not just the career issues, but the

421
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,400
cancer, the family? Stress is stress is

422
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,360
rough. Uh the stress is very hard. Um,

423
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,400
and and I think that stress is, you

424
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,919
know, one of the worst things to to to

425
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,120
be going through when you have cancer.

426
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,959
It it aggravates it all. Um, also, I

427
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,480
don't know if you guys felt this, but

428
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:34,080
anytime I wake up with like a weird

429
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,559
crick right here, I freak. I'm like, "Oh

430
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,559
my god." Like, it's spread. Like, now I

431
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,840
have like some weird neck cancer. Now I

432
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,400
have throat. Like you just imagine that

433
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,120
you're breaking down all over and your

434
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,360
your entire body is breaking down in you

435
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,799
and that's incredibly stressful. And

436
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,320
really all it means is you should treat

437
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:57,360
yourself and go get a massage, right?

438
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,120
You're a courageous woman. I admire your

439
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,160
determination, but the one word I put

440
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,440
next to your name is grace. Oh, God

441
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,880
bless you. And I wish you the best as

442
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,320
you go through this. Please keep us

443
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,600
posted on the surgery. I'll be

444
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,559
supporting you and praying for you. to

445
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,280
everybody else here.

446
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,280
Thank you for watching.
