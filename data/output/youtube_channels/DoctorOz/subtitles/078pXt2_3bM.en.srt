[Applause]

2
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,040
Could knowing your personality type be

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,279
the key to unlocking your hidden

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,160
potential? A groundbreaking new quiz

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,040
says yes. Understanding the truth about

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,040
character traits like compassion,

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,279
enthusiasm, openness can help everybody

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,680
better cope with the unrelenting chaos

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,080
of the day and set yourselves up for

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,080
success. Today, clinical psychologist

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
Dr. Jordan Peterson is here with a

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
personality type quiz you need to take.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,599
It'll reveal new things you didn't know

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,239
about yourself and the people around

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,239
you. Read some books. Learn to talk.

16
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,079
Learn to think. Make yourself into

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,640
something. Get the hell out there and

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,280
make the world that put you here happy

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,640
that you were put there. Jordan

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Peterson, professor, author, disruptor,

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,520
and controversial figure. The often

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,920
called provocator, is a Canadian

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,239
psychologist whose YouTube lectures and

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,520
podcasts have taken the internet by

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,239
storm. With more than 68 million views,

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,840
he often explores and ignites fiery

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,920
discussions on faith, personality,

28
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,560
self-empowerment, and identity politics.

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,040
Jordan's book, 12 Rules for Life, has

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,119
sold millions of copies. It challenges

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,760
readers to stand up straight with their

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,479
shoulders back and accept the terrible

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,680
responsibility of life with eyes wide

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,759
open. An unconventional hero to some,

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,840
he's become an outspoken critic to

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,400
others. Jordan is someone who's not

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,960
afraid to ruffle feathers and go against

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,360
politically correct culture. Yet,

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,759
despite backlash, Peterson fills

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,680
auditoriums with followers who say he's

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,200
brought order to the chaos of their

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,920
lives. Dr. Peterson has renewed my faith

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,159
in the fact that there really is and can

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,119
be and should be more than one

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,040
perspective in a situation. Jordan is so

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,360
passionate about his work and the

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,240
positive effect it has on others, he is

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,920
sometimes moved to tears. Some kid jumps

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,520
out of his car and comes rushing over

50
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,399
and tells you how much better his life

51
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,000
is because he's been working hard on the

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,080
basis of your recommendation to fix his

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,319
relationship with his father. They had

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,959
their arms around each other and they're

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,360
just smiling away. Today, Jordan

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,400
Peterson is here to tell you how to

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,200
reach your full

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,959
potential. Welcome to Dr.

59
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,239
Peterson. For many viewers, it's going

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,840
to be the first time they've heard about

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,760
you, so I'm glad they got to see that

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
little piece. Uh, and you become a rock

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,200
star for a lot of folks. I'm just

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
curious, what is your hope of how you

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
can get people to change their lives for

66
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,920
the better?

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,319
I'm hoping that I can help people

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,480
understand that they can find deep

69
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,560
meaning in their life. That that's

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,720
better and more nourishing, let's say,

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,879
than the pursuit of happiness. And that

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,720
they can find that meaning mostly as a

73
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,599
consequence of voluntarily adopting

74
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,200
responsibility. And so that seems to be

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,959
going quite well at the moment, that

76
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,879
idea. The idea is resonating with a lot

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,400
of folks. But there are critics who who

78
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,720
don't like your philosophies of

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
psychology. they find them provocative

80
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,760
and and controversial is probably the

81
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,159
word that's most associated with you.

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,680
Explain that to us. Well, some of what's

83
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,680
controversial in relationship to the

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,280
personality quiz, for example, is that

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,040
credible social scientists,

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,879
psychologists know that there are

87
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,040
differences in personality between men

88
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,120
and women and that those can't only be

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,120
attributed to socialization. And so

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
that's apparently become a controversial

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,040
issue. The idea that there are

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,640
fundamentally five personality types,

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,959
let's say, or traits, that's somewhat

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,239
controversial as well. Um, the idea that

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,360
these have biological roots, that's also

96
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,760
controversial, but the science is

97
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,440
wellounded and so and and people need to

98
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,120
know the truth as far as I'm concerned.

99
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,640
So, I'd like the audience to hear this

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
out and try to incorporate into their

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,000
lives and take what works for as always

102
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,760
is the case. So, let's talk about

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,120
specifically our audience. What are the

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,680
biggest mistakes people watching right

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,120
now are making as individuals when they

106
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,720
try to live the life of chaos that so so

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,799
often engulfves us? Well, I think

108
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,799
there's two two fundamental problems.

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,040
One is it's really hard to see yourself

110
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,799
as other people see you, you know. So it

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
it's it's not easy to get an objective

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,840
view of your personality and it's

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,360
helpful can help you understand your

114
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
strengths and weaknesses better and

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,439
rectif capitalize on your strengths and

116
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,000
rectify your weaknesses. I think also

117
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,759
that people don't do as much conscious

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,199
planning for their life as they might to

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,000
think out into the future and decide

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,400
what they need and want and then to work

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,639
strategically towards that. Uh those are

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,800
both and the other thing people lack too

123
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,720
they lack a really good vocabulary for

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,520
personality you know and to think things

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,680
through clearly you have to understand

126
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,040
the proper terminology and it's not

127
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
surprising that people don't have that

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
because it hasn't been that long since

129
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,080
personality psychologists have converged

130
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,759
on a stable a stable vocabulary. So this

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
is the goal today to give folks some

132
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,040
words that we can all use to describe

133
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
ourselves to understand what's really

134
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,000
happening in your life and hopefully

135
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,000
react to it. So, we got a quiz. It's

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
going to reveal your new personality

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,199
type, right? It's going to help you

138
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,199
achieve your goals. Audience, you all

139
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,199
have clipboards. Are you all interested

140
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,880
in participating? All right. So, all you

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,600
got to do is pay attention to these six

142
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,960
questions. They're they're the ABCDE.

143
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,120
Circle the ones. Everyone at home, you

144
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,440
can follow on dot.com. It's pretty

145
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,199
straightforward. These six questions uh

146
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,199
are all going to help us figure out at

147
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,639
the end what type of personality you

148
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,000
appear to have. And Marissa's going to

149
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,080
start us off. How are you? Good. How are

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
you? What are your goals that seem to be

151
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,880
just out of your reach right now? Well,

152
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,400
just like everybody else else my age,

153
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm trying to find the perfect career

154
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,639
that really suits my personality. That

155
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,199
it job that I just love. So, how how can

156
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,479
your quiz help her reach her goals? Ma's

157
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,880
not alone with that goal. Well,

158
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,120
generally speaking, it's better to find

159
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,120
a job that matches your personality than

160
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
it is to match yourself to the job. Now,

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,440
you have to do a little bit of both,

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,759
obviously, because life is about

163
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,840
negotiation. So, if you know who you are

164
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,840
and what your personality is, then you

165
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,840
can find a career that not only will you

166
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,520
find more meaningful and engaging, but

167
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,840
you're likely to do better at, which is

168
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,199
also obviously of crucial importance,

169
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
assuming you want to do better. You

170
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,360
ready? I'm ready. Take it away. The

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,600
first question, Dr. Peterson, is choose

172
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:14,880
a word from this list that describes you

173
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:17,840
best. A talkative, B kind, C anxious, D

174
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,720
efficient, or E imaginative. Right,

175
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,720
Marissa, your best answer. I would

176
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,000
definitely have to say a talkative. I'm

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,759
a social butterfly in every situation. I

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,680
can sort of see that. All right,

179
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,440
audience, keep track when keep moving.

180
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
Go ahead and label yourself. Again,

181
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,560
you're doing it. Don't cheat on it

182
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,919
because it's going to be your wisdom

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,360
that you're going to share with yourself

184
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,080
later on. Dr. Peterson, the next

185
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,560
question. Think about your best friend.

186
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,600
What single word from this list would he

187
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,280
or she use to describe you? A.

188
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:54,880
Enthusiastic. B cooperative, C

189
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,720
worrisome, D organized, or E creative.

190
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,120
Right, everyone has your letter. Pick it

191
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,800
whatever suits you that you as you feel

192
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,039
you describe it. Marissa, what would you

193
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,039
pick? I would definitely say that I'm e

194
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,280
creative. I'm always coming up with new

195
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,080
ideas in different situations that are

196
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
thrown at me. Right now, actually, your

197
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,440
best friend is in the front row of the

198
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,960
audience. May I audit your answer?

199
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,960
Absolutely. You okay with that? All

200
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,720
right, Kayla, it's up to you now. Be

201
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,319
tell me the truth now. No one's gonna

202
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
know if you don't. Go ahead. No, I

203
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,599
definitely agree with Marissa's answer.

204
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,479
She's the most creative friend in our

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,880
group. I love to bounce ideas off of her

206
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,800
all the time. Oh my goodness. I think

207
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,080
she likes you, too. We're best friends.

208
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,240
All right. Thank you for being honest

209
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,919
about those. Next quiz question is

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,800
actually one that I wrote up. Take a

211
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,599
listen. Here's the next question on the

212
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,759
new personality type quiz. Pick the

213
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,360
activity that sounds most like something

214
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,560
you would do. A, plan a party. B, donate

215
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,360
to a charity. C, share a problem with a

216
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,680
close friend. D, make a schedule for

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,639
your week. Or E, create a piece of art.

218
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
All right, everyone, circle your

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,960
answers. Dr. Peterson, what answer did

220
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,319
you circle? Let me ask the doctor. Make

221
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,919
a schedule for the week. D. Yep. All

222
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,280
right. It was a bit of a tossup because

223
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,879
I could have answered E because I do

224
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,160
engage in creative activities. It's

225
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,680
probably common that you could pick more

226
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,440
than one. So, you're looking for

227
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,879
proponence. You know what you leaning

228
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,479
towards most of the time. Exactly. All

229
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,479
right. Coming up, the final three

230
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,400
questions you don't want to miss. You'll

231
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,120
find out what personality type you are.

232
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,360
So, stick around. Hi, it's Lisa Oz and

233
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm here with the next question on Dr.

234
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,240
Peterson's personality type quiz. Are

235
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,479
you ready? Okay. Here are some addages

236
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,919
to live by. If you could only choose

237
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,360
one, would it be A? Spend as much time

238
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:46,800
as you can with friends, B. Take care of

239
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:50,320
those in need, C, safety first, D, do

240
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,720
your duty, or E, beauty will save the

241
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,200
world. Remember, circle the answer that

242
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,800
best relates to you.

243
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,399
All right, once you guys all circle,

244
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,680
right, I hope you circle one of home as

245
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,279
well. That was my wife Lisa with one of

246
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,120
the questions of the new personality

247
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,640
quiz that can help you unlock your

248
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,160
hidden potential. Now remember, pay

249
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000
attention to the letters of circling. We

250
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,040
got all the stuff on dr.com. Got two

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,080
more key questions you don't want to

252
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,360
miss. Dr. Peterson, take it away. If you

253
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,320
had to admit to a single fault, what

254
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,000
would it be? A. I dominate

255
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,800
conversations. B. I let people take

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,120
advantage of me. C. I worry too much. D.

257
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,480
I can be a

258
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,320
perfectionist. E. I can be

259
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,360
scatterbrained. Audience, how many bees

260
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,720
were there? Out of curiosity, bees.

261
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,760
Yell out your answers. What was it? Just

262
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,519
yell them out.

263
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,959
Perfect. Everybody's different. I mean,

264
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,160
that's part of the the beauty of this.

265
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
We're supposed to be different. And just

266
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,760
to be clear, it's not about tolerating

267
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,920
each other. We want differences. It

268
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,880
makes this the bulla base taste better.

269
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,360
All right. Actually, you know what? Come

270
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,080
back here. Jill, how is that your name?

271
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,920
I'm Jill. Yes. What' you pick? I uh can

272
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,080
tend to be a perfectionist. You're a

273
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,360
perfectionist. I contend to be. Yes. Oh

274
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,440
my goodness. Some people give you a hard

275
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,920
time for that. Um not so much anymore.

276
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,120
I've been working on it over the years.

277
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,120
We'll see. But why is it important to

278
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
focus on your faults? Because if you do

279
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,160
things badly, then you're going to run

280
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,920
into trouble in life. And so you have to

281
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,399
understand that with every gift that you

282
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,800
have, there comes a an equivalent risk.

283
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,560
And you want to manage the risk and and

284
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,640
amplify the benefit of the of the

285
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,640
positive. And so it's very useful to

286
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,320
know when you can go too far. If you're

287
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,680
conscientious, you make you're a good

288
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,519
manager, you're a good administrative

289
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,839
type, you can organize things, but you

290
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,839
might manage people to the point where

291
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,920
they can't work with you. And so that's

292
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
that's when you've gone too far. Every

293
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,040
good thing can go too far. So my wife

294
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,399
calls me the medddler. I'm a D2, by the

295
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
way, on that. You know, I'm a

296
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
perfectionist. And so I get into things

297
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,079
I shouldn't be getting into, like what

298
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,360
time the kids are getting picked up,

299
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,519
right? And then she'll put me say, "Put

300
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,800
your cape on, Mr. the medddler, right?

301
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,160
The superhero that you don't want to be

302
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,360
one. And I think that's important

303
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,720
though, you know. So, these aren't all

304
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,760
good or bad. They're what you make out

305
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,279
of them. They're the cards you were

306
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,720
dealt. Well, if you're conscientious

307
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,720
like that, sometimes you have a hard

308
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,160
time seeing the forest for the trees,

309
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,519
right? And that's a problem if you need

310
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,040
to concentrate on the forest. You're not

311
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,360
speaking to me personally, are you?

312
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,920
Well, maybe. All right. The last

313
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,880
question. Dr. Peterson.

314
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,760
When faced with a problem, I tend to

315
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,160
approach it A

316
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,240
energetically, B

317
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:28,200
cooperatively, C nervously, D

318
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,120
dependably, or E

319
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,800
curiously. Why is that important? Well,

320
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,000
there's lots of ways to solve problems,

321
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,480
which is why there's lots of different

322
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,399
personality traits and types. And so if

323
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
you're an extroverted type, then you're

324
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
going to be able to rely on your ability

325
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
to use your social skills to bring in

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
information and solve problems. If

327
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,800
you're more on the nervous end of

328
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,000
things, you're going to be you're going

329
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,519
to be concerned with security and

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,279
safety. And that can be very useful in

331
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,959
lots of occupations. If you're

332
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,560
agreeable, then the fact that people

333
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,240
like you and you like them is one of

334
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,839
your skills. If you're organized and

335
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
conscientious, then you can use that

336
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,560
that scheduling ability and to move

337
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
yourself ahead. And if you're open, then

338
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,000
you can think laterally and creatively.

339
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,000
And you need to know which of those is

340
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,519
your forte and and and to understand

341
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,360
that those are all valid means of

342
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,600
solving problems. You ready for the

343
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,639
answers? Coming over here. Okay. We're

344
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399
going to give you the truth about your

345
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,079
person personality type. But first,

346
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,519
let's reveal how to interpret your

347
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,160
answers. Tell up which letter you

348
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,160
circled first. If you did mostly A's,

349
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,440
then you're a personality type that's

350
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,720
called extroverted. That's the most

351
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,399
dominant one. That's what Dr. Peterson

352
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,399
was just speaking about. If you answered

353
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,839
mostly B's, then you're mainly an

354
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,600
agreeable person. Mostly C's means you

355
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,560
are

356
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,360
neurotic. But let me be clear about

357
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,880
this. This is not a bad thing. You need

358
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,839
some neurosis. We all need a little bit

359
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,920
of it. That's one of the things that's

360
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,800
most interesting. We don't have the

361
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,839
vocabulary. As Dr. Peterson was

362
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,279
mentioning, we need to have the words.

363
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
If you're a neurotic person and you know

364
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,560
how to use it, right, it's a wonderful

365
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,600
asset to have. You have to be sensitive

366
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,959
to risk. Yeah. Exactly. And we all and

367
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
we need one member of the tribe to be

368
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,160
sensitive to risk or else we all get

369
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,920
eaten by the saber-tooth tiger. Most

370
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,720
ED's you're conscientious and most E

371
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,839
your dominant type is

372
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,079
openness. Now what do these personality

373
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,600
types mean? And how do you use your

374
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,480
dominant trait to harness your hidden

375
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,639
potential? That my friends is next. Dr.

376
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,360
Jordan Peterson says there are five

377
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,920
major personality types and uncovering

378
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,639
your truth about who you really are can

379
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,800
unlock your hidden potential. Did you

380
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,800
find out you're an extroverted type? If

381
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,760
so, that means you're often assertive,

382
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,440
enthusiastic, and

383
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,600
social. Extroverts are energized by

384
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
contact with others in a big group.

385
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,920
However, highly extroverted people can

386
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,959
also be highly impulsive and not

387
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,360
consider future risk. What about the

388
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,440
openness type? If this is you, that

389
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,160
means you often think outside the box

390
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,399
and are highly creative.

391
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,480
But people who are high in openness can

392
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,560
sometimes find it hard to find a sense

393
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,720
of self because of their diverse

394
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,240
interests. So try to zero in on what

395
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,000
really makes you

396
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,760
happy. Those are two of the personality

397
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,120
types from our new quiz that everyone

398
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,480
should take to unlock their hidden

399
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,560
potential. Now it's time to break down

400
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,160
the three others. Clinical psychologist

401
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,519
Dr. Jordan Peterson is back. Some of

402
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,600
these personality types may have

403
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,160
negative connotations. So I'm going to

404
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,760
start with one which is neuroticism. And

405
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,839
Monnique, you tell us that that's what

406
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,800
you uncovered. Yeah. How do you react to

407
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,839
that? How do you deal with that

408
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,000
possibility? Is that how you would

409
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,480
describe yourself? Not at all. I

410
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,720
definitely always look ahead for things

411
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,240
and I'm, you know, always planning for

412
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,040
the future, but I never would have

413
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,199
called myself neurotic, but I'm neurotic

414
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,800
apparently. So, so that's not a bad

415
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,160
thing. Dr. Peterson, help Monnique and

416
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,399
others who are It also sounds like

417
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,040
you're conscientious. Yes. And so,

418
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,720
everybody scores on all five traits. So

419
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,040
the thing about neuroticism, it's the

420
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,360
negative emotion dimension. And people

421
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,440
who are higher in neuroticism feel more

422
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,040
anxiety and emotional pain than average.

423
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
And but the advantage to that is they

424
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,199
can make you very risk sensitive and

425
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
watching for where things of danger

426
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,240
might lie. And so if you're planning

427
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,839
your future for example, you can see

428
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
pitfalls and then you can avoid them

429
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,519
which is a big deal. Yes. Who ever would

430
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,279
thought we would celebrate neuroticism

431
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,880
is a good thing. Thank you Monique.

432
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,360
Thank you. Okay. Come on over. Now, the

433
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,120
next personality

434
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,560
type, well, it's mine because when I did

435
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,480
the survey, I end up being the

436
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,639
conscientious personality type, which

437
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,160
is, you know, seemingly good, but not

438
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,760
good in all the different ways. So,

439
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,040
please explain the goods and the bads.

440
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
And I know that all these have a little

441
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,160
bit of each. Well, you can rely on

442
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,920
conscientious people to do what they say

443
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,560
they're going to do. We have duty and

444
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,399
responsibility. Yep. Duty and

445
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,279
responsibility. Um, they're reliable and

446
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,800
organized, but they also have a Hey, how

447
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,240
do you like that? Yeah. Well, it's a

448
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,560
very organized show, so you can see

449
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
that. But the downside is that people

450
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,079
who are high in conscientiousness have a

451
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,839
tendency to micromanage. If you have to

452
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,759
know what's going on all the time, then

453
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,440
no one else gets to step in and do that.

454
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,360
But I hear that voice all the time that

455
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,880
I have to cuz I'm not sure anybody else

456
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,800
will. So, how does someone like me deal

457
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,240
with that? Well, partly what you do is

458
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,399
do what you can to surround yourself

459
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,240
with people who are reliable. It it

460
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,199
involves a little bit of a risk, but you

461
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,720
got to pull back if you're

462
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,360
micromanaging. I started writing down

463
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,959
things that I had to do, not things that

464
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,160
because I wanted to, not all the things

465
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,600
that I needed to do. And that's one way

466
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,959
I began to triage my life cuz I would

467
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,360
have just gone down the rabbit hole.

468
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,360
Okay, we got Holla here. Her dominant

469
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,680
personality is it being agreeable. Okay.

470
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,800
So, that seems like a good thing to be

471
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,639
agreeable, but as I read more and more

472
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,199
of your work, I begin to think that's

473
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,279
not always a plus. So, you describe

474
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,800
yourself as being agreeable. I do. I

475
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,639
like to keep things like light and

476
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,000
positive and when it comes to like going

477
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,160
out with my friends, I'm always the one

478
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,199
that's like down for whatever, you know.

479
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,800
Are you a warm person? Um, I am. I am.

480
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,079
I'm the one that people confine it in.

481
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,920
Right. There you go. That's part of

482
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,959
agreeableness. Yeah. So well the so the

483
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,880
downside of that that's the

484
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,800
self-sacrificing element is that it's

485
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,720
harder for agreeable people to argue on

486
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,560
their own behalf and it's easy for them

487
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,240
to get resentful you know because you're

488
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,519
kind of caring for the world and maybe

489
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,920
you assume that that's going to be

490
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,279
reciprocated or maybe you care for other

491
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,120
people more than you even care for

492
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,360
yourself that's harder for agreeable

493
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,199
people

494
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,880
there you go I tell you now this is a

495
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,559
call to action this is really important

496
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,319
clearly so for people who are agreeable

497
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,600
thank you for being agreeable but make

498
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,600
sure we're doing the right thing by you

499
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,520
as well so agreeable abled people often

500
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,959
don't make as much money and part of the

501
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,559
reason for that is it's harder for them

502
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,319
to negotiate on their own behalf.

503
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,160
They're not as demanding in situations

504
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,559
where they need to be and it can be a

505
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,319
bad medium to long-term strategy. Oh, I

506
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,200
love these insights. Go ask for a raise

507
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,559
right after the show. Right. Yeah. Well,

508
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
thank you very much. I hope that's

509
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,480
helpful. Dr. Peterson been

510
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,240
extraordinarily valuable. Thank you very

511
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,559

chaos. And he has joined me on a series

517
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,600
helpful for a lot of folks watching in
