00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,000
An Oz food investigation. Frozen fish.

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,240
One of our favorite heat and eat foods.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
But what's really in those fish sticks?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,920
The price is too cheap versus all the

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,160
others. There's probably some filler in

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,400
it. Are you being conned in your freezer

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,560
section? Plus, breaking news on a

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,560
dangerous outbreak. You're spreading

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,640
billions and billions of droplets and

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,119
many people can be exposed to that. How

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,230
to protect your family from the measles.

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,920
Coming up next.

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:36,520
[Music]

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,520
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,320
[Music]

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,460
I love you back.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,460
[Music]

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,429
[Applause]

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:00,399
From this swimming around to this. And

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,399
then finally to this, right? Frozen fish

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,040
sticks and breaded fish fillets are

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,119
hugely popular heat and eat foods for

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,280
your families, right? We all eat them,

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,240
but they've also been called the hot dog

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,400
of the sea. Is there an undercurrent of

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,280
deception? Today, we're investigating to

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,119
find out if it's cod or a con in the

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,799
freezer section of your grocery store.

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,880
And to help me out, I invited the man

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,360
known as a supermarket guru who tracks

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,000
industry food and consumer changes, Phil

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,080
Lumper. Thank you very much. Thank you.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, Phil says there's a lot of ways that

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,159
the history of frozen food, the industry

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
itself, tells us the story of the fish

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,520
stick. So, how do those histories match

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,119
up? It does. Uh, first of all, I love

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
frozen foods. When you really think

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,000
about it, they're convenient, they

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,640
reduce cost, and they give access to us.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,240
So, think about the landlock um in the

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,040
middle of the country that didn't have

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,119
fish. So, by having frozen fish, what

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,520
we've basically been able to do is give

45
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,840
good nutrition throughout the entire

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,000
country. And that's so important. Now,

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
when we look at fish sticks, nobody woke

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
up in the morning and said, "Hey, I want

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320
a fish stick." you know, whether it was

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,959
a kid or or a mom, what it really was is

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,200
the food companies going out there and

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,720
being able to get all this fish from the

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,200
ocean, bring it back, and make it into a

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,040
very convenient, very convenient product

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,120
because most people are really afraid of

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,520
fish. They don't know how to cook it.

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,160
Um, and if you look at consumption, fish

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,520
consumption is only about 14.7 pounds

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,480
per person per year versus poultry or

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,400
red meat, 222

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,959
pounds of meat. So that's why we need

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,840
frozen fish to be able to come into

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,440
every home. That's less than 10% of what

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,280
we eat in chicken and meat. Do you guys

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,000
have any idea about that? No. How many

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
people are afraid of fish here? Afraid

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,040
to cook it. Afraid to cook it. Yeah. Not

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,640
afraid of bent attack. Yeah. There are

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,760
some folks you would do. We do it the

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
right way. If we don't do it enough,

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,319
might get sick. If we do too much, it

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,400
tastes like wood. All right, let's take

73
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,599
a look at why fish stickicks became so

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,440
popular because I love when we get to

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,400
the roots of how this even happened.

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,680
Because you're right, no one came up

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,519
with the idea of a fish stickick. There

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,599
was a reason for it. So, Americans upped

79
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,519
their fish consumption during the war

80
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,519
when meat was scarce, right? You had

81
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,920
couponing, it was hard to get it, right?

82
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,920
But when sales dropped off, peace of

83
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,760
course broke out, the sales dropped off

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,200
and beef went back on the table. You

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,360
didn't have to do this. So the fish

86
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,599
industry had to up the ante and find

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
better ways to cut costs with freezing

88
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,360
and preserving the fish to sell to the

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,519
masses. So they got these trollers

90
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,599
ships, right? They became factories at

91
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,480
sea. They would catch and even processed

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,040
fish, right, before coming on shore. But

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,360
people still weren't convinced because

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,360
early frozen fish didn't do so well,

95
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,360
right? It had freezer burn, right? It

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,440
was sort of bland. It wasn't winning

97
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,360
over the customers. So, economists from

98
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,200
Harvard and scientists from MIT,

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,239
partially funded by our government, set

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,280
out to find a winning sales idea. And

101
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,280
Phil, that idea was,

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,360
you're going to laugh. It's breading it

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,840
and frying it. We love it. It's

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,040
delicious. All these big heads got

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,519
together with government funding and

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,959
figured that out. Exactly. Um, so it's

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,439
it's really important when we look at

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,920
fish sticks uh to really understand how

109
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,000
they're made, why they're made, and and

110
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,680
really the popularity of it. and all

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,639
these marketing dollars that have been

112
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,560
put against it to really convince people

113
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,160
that they should be eating fish. Let's

114
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,840
look at some of the the fish cons that

115
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919
many of you out there have. Things that

116
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,240
people worry about. Fishcon number one

117
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,360
is that the fish sticks are not made of

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,800
real fish. Not true. Not true at all. In

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,639
fact, look at the ingredients. That's

120
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,440
always the key to this. So, it could be

121
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,520
made from tilapia, cod, or pollic or

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,280
some combination of it. What then

123
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,759
happens just as you described on the

124
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,759
boat, it is then put and frozen into

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,919
blocks. Usually the blocks are about

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
five times this size. This is fish. This

127
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,240
is fish. And the reason that they freeze

128
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,759
it into blocks and it's just solid fish.

129
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,759
There's no filler. Mash this up and put

130
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
like make into a box. Exactly. And then

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,160
it goes through basically saw blades to

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,479
make it into different shapes like

133
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,080
frozen fish sticks or it could be like a

134
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,759
little cookie cutters. So you have

135
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,919
frozen fish nuggets. It's like a lumber

136
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,639
yard. You're just cutting them. It's but

137
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,320
better. But again, it's all real fish,

138
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,479
so you don't have to worry about

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,560
anything like that. But again, always

140
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,759
read the ingredients. So, is there

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880
filler in the fish? I mean, if I'm

142
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,240
literally just taking this and making

143
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,400
into a block and chopping it, is there

144
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,039
filler when I get the box in this box

145
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,960
today? No. Going back a few years, sure,

146
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,120
there were fillers in it. But frankly,

147
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
we as consumers are smarter. So, you see

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,400
right on the front of a lot of these

149
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,800
packages where it says no fillers

150
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
because that's the siren to a mom that

151
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,720
says, "This is what I want. We want

152
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,720
products that have less ingredients, not

153
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,320
more ingredients. If it doesn't say no

154
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,639
filler, that probably means there is

155
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,960
filler. Well, turn it around. There's

156
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,120
very few very few fish stickicks out

157
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,919
there now that have fillers, but it it's

158
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,240
possible. If the price is too cheap, you

159
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,840
know, versus all the others, uh, then

160
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,360
there's probably some filler in it. So,

161
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,720
once they have the right shape, right,

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,720
whatever shape you desire, then you take

163
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,160
it to the factory, you fry them, right?

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
Bride them, and they fry them, right?

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
Okay. So, what kind of oils they use in

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,960
order to accomplish that goal? And I ask

167
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,960
it because one of the main reasons I

168
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,800
talk about fish is because I want you to

169
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,240
get the healthy oils in there. Exactly.

170
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
And you're bringing up the biggest

171
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,039
problem because we want omega-3s. Um

172
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,039
that's the real benefit. So if they're

173
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,280
frying it in certain oils like

174
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,280
cottonseed oil or other vegetable oils

175
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
that are very high in saturated fats,

176
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,039
you're defeating the purpose. So again,

177
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
look at that nutritional information

178
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,360
panel. On it, it'll say how much

179
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,639
saturated fat is in that product. And if

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,479
it looks really high,

181
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,880
out the door. Out the door. Next frozen

182
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,800
fish con. Uh, and this is an important

183
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,080
one, was that these are just junk foods.

184
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,440
They're filled with preservatives

185
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,120
because they come in boxes. You know, it

186
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,440
doesn't come looking like a fish. So,

187
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
explain what what risks may really exist

188
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,919
here. Sure. Well, the first one is not a

189
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,720
risk. It's called STP. And basically

190
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,639
what this is is a polyphosphate. It's a

191
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,639
sodium bath. And the reason is if you

192
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,680
look at a piece of white fish like this,

193
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,479
it's made up of 80% water. If you look

194
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,400
at salmon, it's 70% water. So what

195
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,479
happens is in the freezing process, if

196
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,720
it's not done properly, and again,

197
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,199
properly meaning freeze it really quick,

198
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,240
really cold temperatures, what happens

199
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,240
is it gets a little little tough uh for

200
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,919
us. So that's why they're doing this. Um

201
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,919
very few companies are doing this

202
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,319
anymore because of the freezing process.

203
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,599
It is totally safe. Not a concern at

204
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,960
all. Just make the reason they did it

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,720
was it would hold on the water in the

206
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,680
fish the right way. Exactly. For the

207
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,960
protein. Not harmful, but we don't

208
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
really need it anymore. Correct. All

209
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,120
right. So, that's fine. How about this

210
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,800
stuff? The Well, TBHQ, that's a

211
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,240
different story. Now, this is used

212
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,919
basically to extend the shelf life of

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,639
products, not only fish, it could be

214
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,199
meats and so on. Now, the FDA says that

215
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,759
it can only be 0.02%

216
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,440
of the total amount of fat in a product.

217
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,599
There have been some animal studies out

218
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,560
there. We don't think it's dangerous.

219
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,280
We're not sure, but if my suggestion, if

220
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,960
you have an ingredient TBHQ on a

221
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,280
product, whether it's meat or fish,

222
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,879
avoid it. That's stated, it's very small

223
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,080
amount in each product. And I think the

224
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,240
bigger reason not to eat too many of

225
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
these is they're fried. So, as much as

226
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,479
you eat fried food, you could probably

227
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,520
get away with a little bit of this.

228
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,960
Exactly. All right. So, we reached out

229
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,440
to the American Frozen Food Institute

230
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,199
and they said that TBHQ isn't commonly

231
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,960
used anymore. Echoing what you said.

232
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,840
They also said read the label. Next fish

233
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,840
to con we investigated is the bread to

234
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,440
fish ratio. But who better to help with

235
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,280
these things, right, than Renatha?

236
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,599
You don't want a fried carb, you want a

237
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,080
healthy fish. So, I had Renatha cut open

238
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,560
some popular fish sticks and wanted to

239
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,560
see if these breaded products are just

240
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,640
bread or just a little crusting of bread

241
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,120
with real fish. What'd you find? So, I

242
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,200
mean, as you can see here, it's not all

243
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,839
that bad. We have some good news here,

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,480
right? So, the major brands, there's

245
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,480
pretty decent bread to fish ratio. And

246
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,800
it actually looks like fish up in there.

247
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
Okay. If you check it out on the on the

248
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
side right there. Right. Mostly fish.

249
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,880
Yeah, exactly. It's nice. Pretty decent

250
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,120
uh bread to fish ratio. But this one

251
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,760
over here. Okay. So, now this one is

252
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,160
called a fish patty. And when we cut

253
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,080
into it, um I don't know what's going on

254
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,680
in here. This fish look a little fishy.

255
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,519
Okay.

256
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,959
This fish look a little fishy. And it's

257
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,320
um circular like a bun. So Phil, I mean,

258
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,680
can you help me out? What's going on

259
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,680
with this one over here? Well, it's

260
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,279
chopped and formed. Um typically when

261
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,920
you see products like that, it could

262
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,519
have a list of 20, 30 ingredients, a lot

263
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
of chemicals, a lot of preservatives,

264
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,760
things that we've never heard of, lots

265
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,120
of spices. So, you know, you're the Dr.

266
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,320
Oz official taste tester. Take a bite. I

267
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,000
don't want to. Okay, fine. I don't blame

268
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
you.

269
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,560
But it's, you know, it looks more like a

270
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,240
hamburger patty. Same concept where

271
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,160
you're chopping up fish. It could be

272
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
varieties of fish. Oh, you're brave.

273
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
Okay. And then, and then it's tastes

274
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,200
pretty good, actually. Tastes good.

275
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,560
That's what all the spices and the

276
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,360
preservatives and the artificial

277
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,440
additives. That's what they all do.

278
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,800
I want fish. I know. But I wouldn't I

279
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,000
wouldn't pay for the good taste. I'm

280
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,360
paying for the fish. I want that to

281
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,080
taste good. Correct. All right. So, you

282
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,600
want you want to buy the fililelets, not

283
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,880
these pre-formed patties. Correct.

284
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,320
That's the big message.

285
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,720
Thank you as always. Want you want the

286
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,959
other half? No, you can have it.

287
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,880
Supermarket guru here says that the

288
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,920
frozen food aisle is changing when it

289
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,760
comes to fish. Come over here. Give

290
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
everyone a pep talk. This is a big deal.

291
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,760
These companies realize that you're

292
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,680
listening. They know that you want the

293
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,120
right food. So, they're making it for

294
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,880
you. What do we need to know? Well,

295
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,399
first of all, if we look in the past 3

296
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,399
years of all the innovation that's

297
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,320
happened in the frozen food case, it's

298
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,720
enormous. We're seeing products that

299
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,720
have three or four ingredients. They've

300
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
really shortened that list of chemicals

301
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,399
and preservatives as we talked about a

302
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,800
moment ago. We're seeing lots of

303
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,360
innovation. For example, baked fish that

304
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,120
comes with sauces to it. And also, what

305
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
I love is we're now starting to see

306
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,519
companies right on the back and the

307
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,760
front of the package list where the fish

308
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,920
comes from, what the species is.

309
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,320
Sometimes the name of the fisherman, the

310
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,240
plant manager, so we can get all the

311
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,720
information we want. What farmers,

312
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,000
ranchers, and fishermen all want is to

313
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,800
give us transparency. And now because of

314
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,279
technology called blockchain, we're able

315
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,160
we're actually able to trace a product,

316
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,320
a fish from the boat to the distributor

317
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,079
to the supermarket to the manager that

318
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,079
puts it out there and all that

319
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,760
information is wide open for everybody

320
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,920
to see. So great news in the

321
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,200
supermarket. Fish is a lot less fishy.

322
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,200
It is fantastic news. Oh yeah, you can

323
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,800
catch Phil and his new podcast, Farm

327
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,920
Salmon lies. There are salmon lies out

328
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,040
there in the grocery store. And the

329
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,480
grocery store doesn't want you even know

330
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,340
about it. Stay with us.

331
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,340
[Applause]

332
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,800
He could be the deadliest serial killer

333
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,519
in US history. Confessing to 90 unsolved

334
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,079
murders, sketching his victims. Every

335
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,480
single victim had the same deadlike

336
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,120
eyes. Could these drawings finally

337
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,920
identify who they are? This man said,

338
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,079
"That looks like my mother." Plus, how a

339
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,000
photographic memory solved this man's

340
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,360
murder. When I get into a crime scene, I

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,320
get into some sort of a zone. All new.

342
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,320
That's coming up tomorrow.

343
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:19,360
[Music]

344
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,200
Is there something fishy with your

345
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,120
supermarket salmon? Some experts are

346
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,959
saying that this healthy fish has turned

347
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,800
into one of the biggest grocery fraud.

348
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,880
So today, Carrie Hefernan from the

349
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,680
Mterrey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch

350
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,000
Council of Chefs is here to investigate.

351
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,680
No one knows fish like this guy. So

352
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,200
listen, the first issue is is that the

353
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,639
salmon secret that supermarkets don't

354
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
want you to know has to do with

355
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,240
mislabeling. And studies are shown that

356
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,720
when we buy fresh salmon, we could be

357
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,480
getting duped almost half the time. Is

358
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,800
that real? Yeah, it's amazing. Uh

359
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,120
Oceanana, an ocean seafood conservancy

360
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,760
group, has found out that as much as 43%

361
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
of salmon is mislabeled. Oh, and this is

362
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,839
something fish fish loving people need

363
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,560
to know. Did you imagine that? I don't I

364
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,399
can say 5% mistake, but 43%. Let's look

365
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,880
at how this is happening because a lot

366
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,639
of it has to do with one problem, right?

367
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,600
And this is a big salmon secret. And

368
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,160
that problem is that 69% of mislabeled

369
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,320
fish is because they identify it as

370
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,959
being wild when it's actually farm

371
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,880
salmon. Now, how can this happen? Why

372
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,240
would people get this wrong? Well,

373
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,560
basically because they'll get more money

374
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,480
for wild salmon. So, one of the things

375
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,160
that you want to think about is actually

376
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,920
buying at some of the larger grocery

377
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,839
stores because they have better labeling

378
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,360
practices uh generally than some of the

379
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,760
smaller operations. Plus, they don't

380
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,279
want to have a big penalty if they're

381
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,720
caught doing it. Whereas the small guys

382
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,079
may not have the resources to figure it

383
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,440
out even. That's right. Much more at

384
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,800
risk. The other thing you need to think

385
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,399
about is that salmon has a season. Do we

386
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,120
have an opportunity? So, shop in the

387
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,839
season. Much like peaches and tomatoes,

388
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,760
it's late spring to early fall. So this

389
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,200
is when fish are at their physical peak.

390
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,279
They're in the ocean getting ready to go

391
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,519
back to their natal rivers and spawn.

392
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,600
And this is when less fraud tends to

393
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,040
occur because there's more wild salmon

394
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,160
naturally in the marketplace. All right.

395
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,480
So if I'm buying fish from now, I

396
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,000
basically go to salmon anyway. I want it

397
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,680
to be wild. I'll buy in the summer or

398
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,160
maybe give me a month or two around the

399
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,000
summer. True. Now the thing is it could

400
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,600
be frozen and then resold as and that's

401
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,279
not a bad thing necessarily. So you can

402
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,279
look for flash frozen salmon or

403
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,839
individually quick frozen salmon. Now

404
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,720
these animals are caught at sea, put

405
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,720
into a hole that's - 10° F in less than

406
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,680
15 minutes. So they actually go through

407
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,440
rigamortis in the defrosting process. So

408
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,279
well handled these fish can be amazing.

409
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,040
Well, why would I just buy my salmon

410
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,320
frozen then? In fact, it's a in the

411
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,040
winter months. Why don't just get it out

412
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
of the freezer, pay less, and have it go

413
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,399
through rigger mortise on my kitchen

414
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,079
table? Absolutely. No problem with that

415
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
at all. I like that. We'll save money,

416
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
too. Absolutely. All right. So, we

417
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,480
reached out to the National Fisheries

418
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,920
Institute for a statement. They agreed

419
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,959
completely that fish fraud is illegal

420
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,560
and ought to be stopped. And they

421
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,320
encourage cousin Ubers to ask

422
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,079
restaurants and retailers if they source

423
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,240
their fish from members of the Better

424
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,839
Seafood Board. The answer has to be yes,

425
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,199
guys. If we don't ask, it's going to

426
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,800
have get worse and worse. If half the

427
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,720
stuff's not what it's supposed to be, we

428
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,399
got to ask. Okay. Next salmon secret is

429
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,320
that your supermarket salmon maybe died

430
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,560
to be the pink color. Think about that

431
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,959
possibility. It's shocking to me they

432
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,079
would actually color your fish. Well,

433
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,839
it's not the worst thing in the world.

434
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,000
So, if you look at this is a wild

435
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,560
salmon. So, it gets that color naturally

436
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,800
from eating a bait that's high in

437
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,440
keratenoids, which could come from algae

438
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,600
or small crustaceans. So, what they do

439
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,680
is they actually introduce keratenoids

440
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,120
into the diet of the farm-raised fish.

441
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
And this is not this is farm raised,

442
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,600
right? Correct. Okay. And this is not a

443
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,199
terrible thing. This is FDA approved and

444
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,600
it's actually basically following a

445
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,079
natural pattern. However, just to show

446
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,680
you, if I gave you the fish without the

447
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,160
dye, it would look like this.

448
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,959
Exactly. Yeah. Exactly. Ow. So, how many

449
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,440
of you would buy this fish over this

450
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,360
fish over this fish? That's the real

451
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,560
question, right? Is that the point? That

452
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
that is exactly the point. This this

453
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,440
this fish is devoid of carnoids. It has

454
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,199
none of it in it. It hasn't been

455
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,639
introduced to the diet. So, it looks

456
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,399
white and it's a little less appealing

457
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,240
and it's going to get less money. All

458
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,680
right. So just looking at it in a bigger

459
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,920
the the color and the price is more of a

460
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,920
scale here. So the the pinker I make it,

461
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,519
the more money I'll get paid. Exactly.

462
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,560
This So how do they I'm sorry I missed

463
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,920
this. In in the wild they algae to make

464
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,120
this happen. They give it pieces of

465
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,480
shrimp. Is that what they That's right.

466
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,399
They give it algae and ground up

467
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,240
crustaceian shells which is totally what

468
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,920
it would be found in the wild diet. Oh.

469
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,519
So they're not giving it paint or dyes

470
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,800
to eat. No, they're reintroducing many

471
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,639
of the things that the fish naturally

472
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,160
would get. Perfect. I feel much better

473
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,199
about this stuff. And by the way, if

474
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,120
you're in New York City, his restaurant

475
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,079
is called Grand Banks. is actually on a

476
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,160
boat. We tackled the pink, but how about

477
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,839
the white? What is that white stuff that

478
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,920
oozes out of your salmon as you cook?

479
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,680
You ever wonder that? I actually like

480
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,660
the taste of it. The answer as we go to

481
00:16:47,680 --> 00:17:09,319
break.

measles outbreak. What top health

488
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,720
officials are saying about why this

489
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,560
contagious disease is making an ugly

490
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,810
comeback.

493
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,480
A breaking news alert. An infectious

494
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,280
disease that has been declared

495
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,280
eliminated almost 20 years ago is making

496
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,600
an ugly comeback and threatening health

497
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,280
emergencies all over the country. Today,

498
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,360
what you need to know about one of the

499
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,559
most contagious infectious disease known

500
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,000
to man. More contagious than smallox,

501
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,160
influenza, even ebola. We investigate

502
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,320
the measles outbreak. What's really

503
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,720
behind the resurgence of this deadly

504
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,679
disease?

505
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,160
It has plagued humanity for centuries. A

506
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,360
dreaded and highly contagious virus few

507
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:22,000
could escape, the measles. It starts

508
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,640
with a fever, cough, and runny nose.

509
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,960
Then comes a rash consisting of small

510
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,440
red spots as the body's temperature

511
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,600
climbs dangerously higher and higher.

512
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,280
Complications can be devastating with

513
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,679
ear infections, pneumonia and

514
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,720
encphilitis and inflammation of the

515
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,039
brain. Historically millions of children

516
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,039
were infected every year and hundreds

517
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,880
died from this highly contagious

518
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,440
disease. But in 1963 all that changed

519
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,320
with the advent of the measles vaccine.

520
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,000
By 1980, it was required for all

521
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,240
children attending public schools

522
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,799
nationwide, although some states do

523
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,080
allow for exemptions. Infection rates

524
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,799
plummeted. And finally, in 2000, measles

525
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,880
was considered to be eliminated. That

526
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:11,200
was 18 years ago. Today, shockingly, the

527
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,440
measles is back. Outbreaks springing up

528
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,600
across the country. Health officials

529
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,640
have likened the resurgence to throwing

530
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,039
a match into a can of gasoline. At

531
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,120
highest risk, infants younger than 12

532
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,200
months, pregnant women with no evidence

533
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,919
of measles immunity, and those with

534
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,080
severely compromised immune systems.

535
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,640
Outrage at the new measles threat is

536
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,480
building. How could this happen? And how

537
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,400
can you protect yourself and your

538
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,240
family?

539
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,039
Let me show you why measles is a

540
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,600
national concern. The outbreak across

541
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,200
the country started last year with more

542
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,559
than 360 cases in 28 states. I mean,

543
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,640
find your state. It's all over the

544
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,080
country. In just in the first two months

545
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,760
of 2019, more than a 100 cases have been

546
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,280
reported. Dr. Nancy Messier, the CDC's

547
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,120
director of the National Center for

548
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,160
Immunization and Respiratory Diseases,

549
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,160
joins us now. Dr. Messier, why has there

550
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,160
been such a huge resurgence of measles

551
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,320
after being eliminated in the US nearly

552
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,320
two decades ago?

553
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,480
Measles has been eliminated in the

554
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,039
United States, but it's continued to

555
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,840
circulate globally, which means we have

556
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,240
continued to have outbreaks in the US.

557
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,480
So, unvaccinated Americans traveling

558
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,080
abroad get exposed to measles and they

559
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,000
bring it back home with them,

560
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,240
contaminating their families and their

561
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
communities. You expect this measles

562
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,000
outbreak to spread to more states at

563
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,159
least this year?

564
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,480
Measles is really difficult to predict,

565
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,440
but it's early in the year and I would

566
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,159
expect to see more cases and more states

567
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,480
impacted. Most Americans are vaccinated

568
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,880
against measles, which limits the spread

569
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,440
of the outbreak, but unvaccinated

570
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,600
Americans put themselves and everyone

571
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,679
around them at risk. This includes

572
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,240
people who can't be vaccinated, for

573
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,640
example, young infants who really count

574
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,720
on the cushion of protection provided by

575
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,159
their communities. So, if there's no

576
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,919
treatment or cure for measles once

577
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,360
you've gotten it, what can people do

578
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,919
right now? What should they know about

579
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,480
preventing measles? There is no

580
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,880
treatment or cure for measles. We also

581
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,600
can't predict how serious each case of

582
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,679
measles is going to be. Eating well,

583
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,760
getting enough exercise, getting good

584
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,400
sleep. Those are all parts of a healthy

585
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,840
lifestyle. But the only way to prevent

586
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,600
measles is to get vaccinated. Before you

587
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,840
travel abroad, you should make sure that

588
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,159
you're protected against measles. And

589
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,520
parents should talk to their doctors to

590
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,000
make sure they're protected against

591
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,919
measles and other vaccinereventable

592
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,880
diseases. Dr. Matson, thank you for what

593
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,880
you're doing at the CDC. So, so many of

594
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,039
us, including doctors, have never seen

595
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,120
or remember what measles looks like. So,

596
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,799
let me show you exactly what goes down,

597
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,240
right? So, measles viruses are spread by

598
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,000
little droplets from an infected person.

599
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
you sneeze it out or you touch something

600
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,559
and the symptoms start about 10 days

601
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
after the infection. You get coldlike

602
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,200
symptoms, runny nose, you get watery red

603
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,200
eyes, high fever. The classic symptoms

604
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,200
that only measles can give you are these

605
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,559
little white spots inside of your mouth.

606
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,559
They're on the cheeks, right? They're

607
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,480
like little grains of white sand. About

608
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,559
2 to four days later, a rash will start

609
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,080
behind the ears before spreading

610
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,159
outwards to the head, the neck, the rest

611
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,360
of the body over the next few days. And

612
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,559
these will coales the spots will

613
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,400
initially be small but they'll get

614
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,760
they'll join together get bigger as and

615
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,360
then as that happens you'll get this

616
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,760
very typical sign of measles. Let's

617
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,320
explain just how contagious the disease

618
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,760
is. Virus hunter Dr. Ian Lipkin is

619
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,159
joining us now. He's an infectious

620
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,760
disease expert from Maya University

621
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,840
Colombia.

622
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,520
I've always respected your expertise on

623
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,640
these issues. You break it down but you

624
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,159
you know you are the person our nation

625
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,280
turns to when we've got viruses we got

626
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,440
to figure out. How contagious is measles

627
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,200
and compare it to Ebola which we all

628
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,000
fear? Compare it to SARS which we hear

629
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,679
about all the time. So this is one of

630
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,400
the most contagious diseases that we

631
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,679
know. When you talk about Ebola which is

632
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,240
something that everyone is concerned

633
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:06,000
about one person may infect two people.

634
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,080
SARS one person may infect four. So so

635
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,400
even SARS which we talk about being

636
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,520
pretty infectious is one person gets it

637
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,039
four others are at risk on average. Yes

638
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,559
that's an average. Right. So if one

639
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,400
person has measles, how many people on

640
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,480
average will they pass it on to? 12 to

641
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,400
18. 18. As many as 18 people. It's a lot

642
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,080
of folks. Assuming those people are not,

643
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,520
of course, vaccinated. And the reason

644
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,039
for that is because it lies dormant in

645
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,480
your body for a couple days or just the

646
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,640
virus itself tends to infect more

647
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,039
people. It just infects more people.

648
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
When you have this this uh period even

649
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,400
before you get the rash, when you're

650
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
coughing and so forth, you're spreading

651
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,559
billions and billions of droplets. And

652
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,760
many people can be exposed to that.

653
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,240
Billions and billions of droplets. You

654
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,000
sound like Carl Sean.

655
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,679
So, how quickly can an infection occur?

656
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,799
And I know the unvaccinated are at

657
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,360
greatest risk. They should be paying

658
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,640
attention that yes, the unvaccinated are

659
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,880
the ones who at risk. If you're

660
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,200
vaccinated, um, you know, you have

661
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,559
excellent protection. But how fast do

662
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,799
you get infected if you haven't been

663
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,640
vaccinated? If you get infected, you

664
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,360
have this period of sort of an eclipse

665
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,600
phase when the virus is dormant and you

666
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,000
don't really see anything very much. But

667
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,039
within 4 days to two weeks, you begin to

668
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,799
see the signs that you showed. The spots

669
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,440
inside the mouth, the swelling of the

670
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,919
glands behind the ears, the rash which

671
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,400
covers your body, and that many people

672
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,400
have pneumonia. So, odds are you may not

673
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,080
even know who infected you. That's

674
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,159
correct. Which makes it even scarier for

675
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,120
me. So, up next, we investigate just how

676
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,720
effective and safe is the vaccine? Could

677
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,159
you get the measles even if you've been

678
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,559
vaccinated? Lots of questions like that,

679
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,559
so stick around.

680

[Music]

Press a few buttons and pop an instant

682
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,279
healthy snack. Or is it more additives,

683
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,919
more chemicals, more stuff? Is there a

684
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,559
microwave popcorn cover up? And the

685
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,799
extremely candid Phillips gets her very

686
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,960
own house call. I'm going to have my Dr.

687
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,799
Oz and I'm going to ask you questions

688
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,600
all the time. Plus, it's the dish on Oz.

689
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:08,080
This week, the best leftover makeovers.

690
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,960
All new Oz.

691
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,200
That's coming up on Wednesday.

692
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,360
So, when I came in contact with the

693
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,400
measles, I started having runny nose, a

694
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,840
fever, um a very severe cough that would

695
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,799
not go away. Um I woke up at night and

696
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,520
um I was struggling to breathe. So, I

697
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,120
went into a coma for 9 months, came out

698
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,799
of the coma. They told my parents,

699
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,240
"Look,

700
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:37,120
she is probably not going to be able to

701
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,840
move. able. He's not going to be a be

702
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:45,600
able to speak. I lost hearing. I lost my

703
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:49,120
vision. My speech I had to go through

704
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,679
many many years through uh to to take

705
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,559
speech therapy. But here I am 30 years

706
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,640
later. I am here to tell my story. You

707
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,919
know that the measles is deadly.

708
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,520
We're back investigating the recent

709
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,440
resurgence of one of the most contagious

710
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,919
diseases out there, measles. Now, that

711
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,279
woman we're just hearing from, we don't

712
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,880
we don't know this for sure, but you're

713
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,559
saying that that loss of hearing is a

714
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,720
pretty common complication. It's a very

715
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,000
common complication of measles. So,

716
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,679
obviously, if you can't hear, you can't

717
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,919
speak. And so, it you know, it takes a

718
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,760
while to do them both together. So, it's

719
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,039
back from the brink of extinction and

720
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,720
causing outbreaks all around the

721
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,400
country. Dr. Lipkin is here to answer

722
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,000
your urgent questions about measles

723
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,279
vaccinations. I'm going to start with a

724
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,120
question I've been getting asked a lot.

725
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,960
If you have been vaccinated already as a

726
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,880
child, you have to get vaccinated again.

727
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,000
Can you still get the measles despite

728
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,480
the fact that you were vaccinated all

729
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,440
those years ago? If you receive both

730
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,320
vaccines, the starter and the booster,

731
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,840
you're not you have 97% protection. So

732
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,760
that's still possible that you could get

733
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,960
measles, but it's very very unlikely

734
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,120
throughout your whole life, even when

735
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,720
you're older. It's lifelong immunity.

736
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,720
All right. So since the outbreak of

737
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,320
these of the measles and the vaccines of

738
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,240
course have been increasing

739
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,159
dramatically, 500% in some affected

740
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,760
areas, but there are still some people

741
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,760
who have not gotten it. So let's talk to

742
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,919
our audience. Krista has been vaccinated

743
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,840
by the with the measles vaccine, but you

744
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,840
still got a question for us. Yes. So, do

745
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,679
I need to get the booster dose again as

746
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,880
an adult since I've already had it as a

747
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,440
child? Well, if you've had both doses of

748
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,840
the vaccine, then you're as protected as

749
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,320
you're going to be. If you only had one

750
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,279
dose, then it's advisable to have a

751
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,400
second dose. But I can see that you're

752
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,080
expecting. Yes, I am. So, I'm concerned.

753
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,559
And if you're pregnant, you should not

754
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,080
have this vaccine. Okay. What? You

755
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,240
should wait until after you have the

756
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,679
child and then you should have the

757
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,960
vaccine. Well, what what if you're not

758
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,840
sure if you've been vaccinated, then you

759
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,919
get it. That's correct. If you if you

760
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,640
can't find any record to indicate that

761
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,039
you've been vaccinated twice, you've

762
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,600
received the first dose and the booster,

763
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,159
then you should take the vaccine. Okay.

764
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,880
Okay. Maria's got a question for us. If

765
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,880
my kid is too young for the second dose,

766
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,720
should I be worried? So they got the

767
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,880
first dose already when they were at 15

768
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,159
months old or so, right? Then now you're

769
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,360
in between that and school age, which is

770
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,240
when you get second dose normally. What

771
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,080
do you do? You can have the second dose

772
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,159
of the vaccine as soon as four weeks

773
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,240
after the first dose. So this is if this

774
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,600
really is a major concern for you,

775
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,159
you're going abroad. You're concerned

776
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,720
that the child may be exposed, you can

777
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,039
get that second dose of vaccine. Okay.

778
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,640
Some worry about the safety of vaccines.

779
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,640
What are the risks?

780
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,640
There's risk with anything we do,

781
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,520
whether you take aspirin or an

782
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,640
antibiotic. But the risk, as you've

783
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,880
seen, with measles, is so extreme that

784
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,000
the risk benefit ratio makes sense. We

785
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,880
have saved 20 million lives since we've

786
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,440
started using the measles vaccine. Some

787
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,279
people are concerned that this vaccine,

788
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,640
the MMR vaccine, may cause autism. We

789
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,279
and others have looked into this in

790
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,440
detail and we found no evidence that

791
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,960
that's the case.

792
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,399
Thank you for answering our questions

793
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,320
and for all of you for being earnest

794
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,080
about this. If if the measles could come

795
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,679
back from the brink of extinction, what

796
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,440
other diseases do we need to watch out

797
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,760
for? The virus hunter's health threat

798
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,880
forecast is next. What you need to do to

799
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,880
protect yourself. Stay with us.

Press a few buttons and pop an instant

healthy snack. Or is it more additives,

803
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,520
more chemicals, more stuff? Is there a

microwave popcorn cover up? All new Oz.

805
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,870
That's coming up on Wednesday.

[Applause]

808
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,039
We are back investigating highly

809
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,200
contagious infectious diseases that are

810
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,960
making a troubling comeback. If cases of

811
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,039
measles are spreading, well, then what's

812
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,279
next? the virus hunter, Dr. Ian Lipkin

813
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,880
is back with the health threat forecast

814
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,159
that you need to know about right now.

815
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,760
How can you protect yourself against

816
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,520
some of the most highly contagious

817
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,200
diseases, right, that have caused

818
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,960
sickness and they have caused death each

819
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,000
year. The first health threat to watch

820
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,080
out for is shingles. Now, this is an

821
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,760
infection that's caused by the same

822
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,960
pathogen, same virus that causes

823
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,159
chickenpox. What do we need to know

824
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,919
about it? Uh, so if you're infected with

825
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,880
chickenpox

826
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,039
uh as a child, the virus lies dormant.

827
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,039
It goes into the nervous system. It

828
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,360
lives there. It waits. And at various

829
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,840
points, it can resurface and cause

830
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,399
disease. A third of people who've had

831
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,559
chickenpox will have an episode of

832
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,640
what's called shingles at some point

833
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,880
during their lifetime. It's most common.

834
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,760
A third a third. It's most common at the

835
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,640
age of 60. And it's a it can be a severe

836
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,640
problem. So many people with shingles,

837
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,200
up to a third, will have this syndrome

838
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,279
called post-erpetic neuralgia, which

839
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,240
means that they have an enormous amount

840
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,039
of pain. It's typically in a band around

841
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,480
their chest or around their abdomen in

842
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,559
the same place where they had the

843
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,480
original rash. And this can be prevented

844
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,399
largely by taking a vaccine. And so

845
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,600
there's a very good, very effective

846
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:00,240
vaccine now that will give you 90%

847
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,960
protection against having shingles. So

848
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,960
we strongly recommend this for everybody

849
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,960
over the age of 60. Now why is it

850
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,120
concerning now?

851
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,039
It's just becoming we're becoming more

852
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,760
aware of it. We also for the very first

853
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,159
time have a way in which we can actually

854
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,840
prevent people from having this disease.

855
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,320
Now there are some people who are more

856
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,080
at risk for shingles than others. people

857
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,000
who are imunosuppressed because they

858
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,120
have cancer or they have an autoimmune

859
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,200
disease. But in our view, everybody over

860
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,640
the age of 60 should have this vaccine.

861
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,159
Yeah, that ugly rash we showed you

862
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,320
earlier is not the real issue. It's the

863
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,720
pain. It's the pain that follows the

864
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,279
rash because what it does is it causes

865
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,360
damage to the nerves. It actually tracks

866
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,240
along the path of the nerves and makes

867
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,320
them hyper sensitive and the pain is

868
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,519
really excruciating for many people. The

869
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
next health threat that's been popping

870
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,440
up all over the and it's in the

871
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,880
headlines right now is whooping cough.

872
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,559
There are health officials saying that

873
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,919
this infectious disease is reemerging

874
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,080
right this second. Why do they believe

875
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,679
that? Well, one of the things about

876
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,679
hooping cough is that we know that we

877
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,240
had a we have a very good vaccine to

878
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,760
prevent this disorder. But unlike the

879
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,080
measles vaccine that we were talking

880
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,399
about earlier, you don't get lifelong

881
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,279
immunity. So, you really should have

882
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,440
boosters for hooping cough every 10

883
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,679
years. And if you do that, then you have

884
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,440
good protection against whooping cough.

885
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,559
So adults can get whooping cough as Dr.

886
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,360
Lipin was saying. So listen careful.

887
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,360
This is what it sounds like

888
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,600
a whooping crane, right? You cough so

889
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,120
much you're having trouble getting air

890
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,080
back into your lungs which could cause

891
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,440
other flu-l like symptoms. Pneumonia is

892
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,200
an example of a complication that comes

893
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,720
from it as well. So who's most at risk

894
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,760
and what can you do to protect yourself?

895
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,760
People again who are imunosuppressed

896
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,480
as I said because of cancer, autoimmune

897
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,799
disease, HIV, AIDS, there are whole

898
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,519
series of things that can make you more

899
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,279
vulnerable to hooping cough. Again, the

900
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,519
best way to protect yourself is to have

901
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,159
this vaccine and you should do that on a

902
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,240
regular basis because again, you do not

903
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,760
get lifelong protection. Dr. Liman,

904
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,760
thank you for all you do. We'll be right

905
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,760
back.

906
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,840
You plan all year for that time away,

907
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,679
but what if your next trip turned

908
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,720
deadly? Tourists are extremely

909
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,600
vulnerable. She was found with rope

910
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,159
slashed. Vacation nightmares. Plus, the

911
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,799
dark underground world of child labor.

912
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,799
All new Oz. That's coming up on

913
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,799
Thursday.

914
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,559
Today I want to focus on one of the most

915
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,880
neglected areas of your skin. I'm

916
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,320
talking about your scalp. Now while you

917
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,120
may not notice right some of the

918
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,960
symptoms of dandruff like the itchiness,

919
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,440
the flakes, the dryness and redness of

920
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,279
the moment, could your future proofing

921
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,080
of your scalp actually help you prevent

922
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,159
problems before they return? My next

923
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,919
guest scientist Dr. Rolanda Wilkerson

924
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,840
says yes. She's here on behalf of my

925
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,159
trusted sponsorship partner, Head and

926
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,000
Shoulders. So why do people forget to

927
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,440
treat their scalp? Well, Dr. Guys, as

928
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,440
you know, our scalp is a part of our

929
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,760
skin. However, most people don't even

930
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,359
think about it unless a problem arises.

931
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,440
For many of us, it's an area covered

932
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,280
with a lot of hair. So, we have this out

933
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,040
of sight, out of mind mentality when it

934
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,280
comes to dealing with it. But taking

935
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,879
care of your scalp is so very important

936
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,399
because you want to have that right

937
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,399
environment, a healthy environment in

938
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,240
order for the healthiest hair to emerge.

939
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,679
Now, just doing damage control on your

940
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,000
scalp and your hair is not the best

941
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,359
approach, but future proofing it,

942
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,119
preventing issues from happening down

943
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,040
the road actually is. look very

944
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,879
trustworthy. Be honest now. Any problems

945
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,000
here? It looks amazing. Because my kids

946
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,240
criticize me all the time. That looks

947
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,839
okay. They're telling the truth. Okay,

948
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,599
you're telling the truth. Thank you.

949
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,119
Backhanded praise. Let me show you why

950
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,639
scientists believe it is so important to

951
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,760
futureproof your hair. So, if you

952
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,720
haven't paid attention to your scalp,

953
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,320
come on over here. Let's get this

954
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,079
together. That is what it may look like.

955
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,560
You see a little the flakiness over

956
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,079
here. They get a little crunchy almost,

957
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,280
right? Flaky and dry. Yeah. It may not

958
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,639
look as healthy as it needs to be, which

959
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,079
means everything else is going to be a

960
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,520
little bit awkward as well, including

961
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,960
the itchiness that you may sense.

962
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,640
Exactly. Dr. Wilkers, show us what

963
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,320
happens if you use a scalp moisturizing

964
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,400
shampoo. Something that actually treats

965
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,480
the layers of the scalp correctly. Sure.

966
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,760
You're able to effectively moisturize

967
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,800
the scalp and this eliminates the

968
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,079
dryness and itchiness and oiliness

969
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,839
essentially enabling you to grow healthy

970
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,760
hair. Now, look at this. This is the

971
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,520
kind of hair you want. That's what you

972
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,520
want. Mhm. And you want them coming out

973
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,520
of a nice bed, right? Of skin that's

974
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,440
healthy and plump and looks like it's

975
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,720
happy. It's happy. It's happy and it's

976
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,839
healthy. This is not itchy and there's

977
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,280
not going to be any flaking landing on

978
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,560
your on your shoulders. Exactly. All

979
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,480
right. So, what do you recommend to help

980
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,400
future proof your hair? Simple, easy

981
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,000
plan that everyone can do. Simple, easy

982
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,079
plan. I'd recommend the Head and

983
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,520
Shoulders deep moisture collection. Now,

984
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,520
many people think Head and Shoulders is

985
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,440
only for dandruff, but that is not the

986
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,359
case. Head and Shoulders enables you to

987
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,520
have a healthy scalp. It gives you that

988
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,359
healthy environment in order for your

989
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,520
hair hair to grow healthy and emerge

990
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,000
from the scalp healthy. Now, our deep

991
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,320
moisture conditioner actually

992
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,960
moisturizes the scalp and cares for the

993
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,880
scalp 10 layers deep. And that's what

994
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,359
regular use. And you have 10 layers of

995
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,160
scalp. Yes. Did you guys know that? 10

996
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,720
surface layers. We focus on the out the

997
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,880
outer one that sheds on us. Exactly. But

998
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,320
we should have a regular scalp care so

999
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,000
that we're moisturizing it and care for

1000
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,040
it just like we would our skinincare.

1001
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,240
Now, our shampoo cares for the scalp and

1002
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,640
moisturizes the scalp 75% better than a

1003
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,560
leading moisturizing shampoo, and that's

1004
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,800
after 16 weeks of regular use in the

1005
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,240
study that we conducted. So, a nurse

1006
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,680
scalp plus gorgeous hair. I mean, who

1007
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,000
doesn't want that? Everyone wants that,

1008
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,160
including my next guest is Jesse James

1009
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,400
Decker's here on behalf of Head and

1010
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,920
Shoulders, and she's joining us via Zoom

1011
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,000
from her living room where she has

1012
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,160
already started to futureproof her hair.

1013
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,079
Jesse, you look wonderful.

1014
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,359
Thank you. How are you all doing? Doing

1015
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,960
well. Listen, I'm always curious if you

1016
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,240
can do it. I'm sure everyone will be

1017
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,079
impressed cuz you've got three kids

1018
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,000
running around. I know they're quiet at

1019
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,920
the moment, but what was your hair like?

1020
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,280
Quiet. What was your hair like before

1021
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,079
this all started? You know, I have

1022
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,880
naturally dry skin. I always have. Um,

1023
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,520
everyone knows it. And I too never knew

1024
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,040
that I needed to take care of my scalp

1025
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,720
the way that I should have. But as soon

1026
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,640
as I started using Head and Shoulders,

1027
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,720
my scalp feels so much more moisturized.

1028
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,800
And I do feel like I don't know, I just

1029
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,480
took care of business.

1030
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
How long did it take for you to notice a

1031
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,720
difference? You know, once I started

1032
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,040
using Head and Shoulder shampoo and

1033
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,440
conditioner, I saw immediately a

1034
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,839
difference. And I did realize how

1035
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,000
important like my scalp health was to

1036
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,760
have beautiful hair. And you know, I'm a

1037
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,440
performer so I want to showcase pretty

1038
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,760
hair. But, you know, now that my scalp

1039
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,520
is healthy and moisturized, I just keep

1040
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,359
using Head and Shoulders a few times a

1041
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,160
week just to futureproof my scalp

1042
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,520
against any damage. Well, I look at that

1043
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,640
their beautiful home behind you and I

1044
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,920
know that you don't have a lot of time

1045
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,599
to yourself. So, I'm assuming this is a

1046
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,000
plan that every woman could use because

1047
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,839
you can squeeze it into your busy day.

1048
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,520
Oh, yeah. You can you can give yourself

1049
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,760
a little massage and take care of your

1050
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,119
scalp in 15 seconds. Trust me. All

1051
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,640
right. Well, God bless you. Look forward

1052
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,280
to seeing you here in the set soon. Take

1053
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,920
care. Yes. Good to see y'all.

1054
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,079
So, Dr. Wilkerson,

1055
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,839
how typical are the results that Jesse

1056
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,359
James Decker is reporting to us? Her

1057
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,200
results are very typical. Head and

1058
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,359
Shoulders protects both the scalp and

1059
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,160
the hair even before it emerges from the

1060
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,240
scalp. That's why we are the only hair

1061
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,240
care brand to win a skin award. In fact,

1062
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,280
we've won four. The most recent one is

1063
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,280
an anti-aging award. And that is because

1064
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,040
of the futurep proofing that our

1065
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,400
products do for the scalp. So, where do

1066
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,920
you find the Head and Shoulders deep

1067
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,079
moisture line? You can find it at

1068
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,040
Walmart and Walmart.com. Now, here's the

1069
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,240
thing. You don't have to look for it if

1070
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,000
you're in our audience because thanks to

1071
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,000
our partner, Head and Shoulders, my

1072
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,079
entire studio audience is going home

1073
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,880
with Head and Shoulders deep moisture

1074
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,440
shampoo and a conditioner.

1075
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,680
But there's more. There's more. You also

1077
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,880
it. We'll be right back.

1078
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,960
I love getting to talk with you on my

1079
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,119
show every single day. But when the

1080
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,440
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

1081
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,520
is not over. I still have a lot that I

1082
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,320
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

1083
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,020
Oz podcast on Apple Podcast or wherever

1084
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,839
you get your podcast.

1085
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,839
[Applause]

1086
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,079
Today, an easy hack that you can do to

1087
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,240
improve your memory. New research says

1088
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,839
your nose your nose can help you

1089
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,960
remember. In fact, breathing through

1090
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,880
your nose, it won't do it together.

1091
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,720
Breath through your nose rather than

1092
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,200
through your mouth may help you recall

1093
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,960
things easier. Scent can actually help

1094
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,640
trigger the brain into remembering. For

1095
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,480
example, remember the smell of fresh

1096
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,800
baked cookies takes you back to your

1097
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,280
childhood, right? Or smell of a flower

1098
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,800
or your grandparents house, right? It

1099
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,880
seems to stimulate this deep

1100
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,560
understanding, this memory. And here's

1101
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,160
why researchers say the nose knows. The

1102
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,079
nose knows because the part of your

1103
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,480
brain that's involved in smell, right,

1104
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,880
the olfactory cortex, olactory gland,

1105
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,880
it's directly next to the area of the

1106
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,079
brain, this area right here, that's

1107
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,040
responsible for memory. It's known as

1108
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,480
the hippocampus, right? And this is

1109
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,079
really critical because when the brain

1110
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,440
has two parts that are next to each

1111
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,760
other that are doing things, they sort

1112
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,680
of reinforce each other. So, we like to

1113
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,680
test things out on the show. I conducted

1114
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,440
a social experiment to determine if

1115
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,839
using your sense of smell can actually

1116
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,079
help your memory. We asked five staff

1117
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,000
members to try and memorize two

1118
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,599
different grocery shop store lists.

1119
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,599
Right? These are shopping lists. One

1120
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,760
before smelling peppermint essential oil

1121
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,720
and a different list afterwards. And we

1122
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,960
found 60% scored better on the test

1123
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,720
after spelling the essential oil. We

1124
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,960
also tried this with a member of our

1125
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,720
audience today. Avery is joining us.

1126
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,480
Thanks for being here. So baseline

1127
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,680
before you got the lavender spell, we

1128
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,359
gave you a shopping list with eight

1129
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,560
items. And how'd you do? Uh, I didn't do

1130
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,079
so hot. Um, I think initially I was

1131
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,880
like, "Okay, I got it." And then I think

1132
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,319
I only got like maybe four or five of

1133
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,839
the items. Well, these are the act the

1134
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,359
checks are the four you actually got.

1135
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,400
Okay. Four. Okay. This list is not

1136
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,680
important because we're going to test

1137
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,160
you again. We just gave you some

1138
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,119
peppermint oil backstage. Yes. Right.

1139
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,720
You remember what to do now. I'm going

1140
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,680
to give you another list. Going to show

1141
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,920
it to you. You got to remember, right?

1142
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,200
You saw the second list. Yeah. Okay.

1143
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,280
Audience, here's the second list. You

1144
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,880
can see it, but she can't. Go ahead. See

1145
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,119
how you can do. Okay.

1146
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,599
Um, okay. So, is it lavender on your Is

1147
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,280
it on your fingers? We put uh peppermint

1148
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,640
on my wrist. Peppermint? Oh, good. Cuz

1149
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,119
lavender will put you to sleep. Okay.

1150
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:36,400
Peppermint on your wrist. So, smell. All

1151
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:40,359
right. I think it um Okay. Eggs, kale,

1152
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,359
um walnuts,

1153
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,720
yogurt. You tied yourself. Okay. Uh

1154
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,720
blueberries. Ooh.

1155
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,480
Oh, avocados

1156
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,079
and uh olive oil. Oh, that's seven out

1157
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,599
of eight.

1158
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,359
Let me see. That's okay. Let's put it up

1159
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,200
here. How close are those? Put the

1160
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,000
shopping list up here. It's You see it

1161
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,040
all? You got seven out of eight. That's

1162
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,880
really good. I think that helped. You

1163
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,720
think the peppermint helped you? I think

1164
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,079
it's actually It's so weird cuz I think

1165
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,920
it's actually kind of really soothing.

1166
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,440
So it makes me like not so anxious about

1167
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,520
trying to remember something. Maybe

1168
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,599
whether the scent helps your mood or

1169
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,440
your comfort level or actually your

1170
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,520
memory if it's working. It's working. It

1171
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,040
is weird. Think things you actually have

1172
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,079
at your fingertips. We don't use all the

1173
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,480
time. I'm very proud of you for doing

1174
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,640
it. And if you got a great memory now

1175
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,319
keep me close to you. Remember the nose

1176
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,280
those and try to use your sense of smell

1177
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,480
next time you need to remember

1178
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,680
something. The other change is

1179
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,640
happening. Our journey is just

1180
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,640
beginning. See you next time.

1181
