1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,960
This man was a wellrespected university

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,759
professor who bought a used car

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,480
dealership in a SD area of town. He was

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,280
also a dedicated father of six until he

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,839
was found murdered in his office. Why

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,800
was he killed? Was it a random robbery

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,600
or something more sinister? Today, when

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,080
science meets crime, how a photographic

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,760
memory helped find his killer. Take a

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
look at the investigation into the

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,039
murder of Dr. Gul Telawir. Dr. can tell

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
where's his daughter Lisa is here. I'm

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,960
sorry for the loss of your dad.

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,559
>> Thank you.

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,760
>> What was your relationship with your

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,440
like?

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,760
>> My father and I were very close. Um, you

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,520
know, he was a good family man, Dr. Oz.

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
My dad wasn't the kind of guy that went

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
away on the weekend to go fishing with

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,120
his buddies or went down to the local

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,960
bar to watch the game. If he had free

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,559
time, it was spent with his children.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,480
So, we were very close.

25
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,360
>> He's a university professor. Yes. A

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,120
doctor.

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,359
>> Taught economics, right? Had a

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,199
doctorate. Did you find it odd that he

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,440
would buy a used car lot? That doesn't

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,080
seem to jive with that profession.

31
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,760
>> My father saw 24 hours in a day and he

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,479
was going to use them to his advantage.

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,560
So coming from a third world country, he

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,320
was such a patriot. He loved America.

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,320
Used to tell us children, I've done my

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,799
job. You're all US citizens. You can

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,720
have, do, be, whatever you want. So it

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,640
was a purely economic decision. You

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,720
know, he would teach until about 3:00 in

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,240
the afternoon and then go to the car lot

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,240
until the early evening and on

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,320
Saturdays. So the used car business can

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,439
have it can be seedy, right? He was in

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,360
Sidi part of town, but the business

45
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,200
itself has sort of a dark underworld

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,119
flavor to it. Did you do you think your

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,799
dad understood the true risks of being

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,119
in that business?

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,640
>> I don't I don't think so, Dr. Oz. I

50
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,880
don't think he saw it that way. You

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,640
know, my father,

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,320
having grown up in Afghanistan, it's it

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,079
was a very violent country. He had a lot

54
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,240
of difficulties there.

55
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,000
>> He saw especially Nashville, Tennessee

56
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
as the promised land. He never felt

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,600
afraid. He never felt threatened.

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,840
>> Yep. He saw America as a place that

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,840
would always be safe. So while that

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,360
business does have that aspect to it, I

61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,920
don't think my father ever saw it that

62
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,560
way.

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
>> Take me back to the day you learned he

64
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,879
had been killed.

65
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,800
>> What happened?

66
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,640
>> So it was March 17th. It was a beautiful

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,480
day. It was the first warm day we had.

68
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,879
So I had all the windows open in my

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,640
house. I was outside and I was um

70
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,160
actually seating my lawn. I had a bow

71
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,920
rake. I had grass seed. And the phone

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,160
kept ringing and I could hear it ringing

73
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,360
and you know, but I was working and so

74
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,040
finally I got tired of hearing it

75
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,760
ringing. I went inside and I answered

76
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,200
the phone and it was my brother and I

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,680
could tell immediately by the tone of

78
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,200
his voice that something was very wrong.

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,519
So he said to me, he said, "Listen,

80
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,680
something really bad happened today." He

81
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,360
said, "Daddy was at his car lot and

82
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
someone came to the lot and they shot

83
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
him."

84
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,800
>> Oh. And I remember asking him, "Shot him

85
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,480
with what?" Like it the information just

86
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,680
wouldn't go in. So my poor brother had

87
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,440
to tell me the story again. He said,

88
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
"Lisa,

89
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,000
daddy was shot today." And then he said

90
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,400
to me, you know, daddy's dead.

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,560
>> Oh. Oh.

92
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,040
>> And I don't know where I went. Excuse

93
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,440
me. So I don't know where I went, but I

94
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,440
went somewhere else because when I came

95
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,120
back, I was on my knees in my bedroom

96
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,840
and I was craling the phone and I was

97
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
just crying. I mean, I was just wailing.

98
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,599
And I heard this voice in my head that

99
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,879
said, "You have to get up. You have to

100
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,200
get up and you have to get up right

101
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,959
now." So I remember standing up and

102
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,159
asking because I knew what I needed in

103
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,000
that moment. and I needed to be in the

104
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,680
same place where my brother was. So, I

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,599
asked him where he was. He told me and

106
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,440
then I just got up, walked out of the

107
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,879
house and and drove to where he was.

108
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,560
>> What did you think had happened to your

109
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,920
father? Why would anyone shoot him?

110
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
>> You know, that that was the part that

111
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,599
was so disconcerting. We had no idea. We

112
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,760
couldn't imagine anyone that held daddy

113
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,000
with such animosity that they would

114
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,799
murder him. You know, we thought maybe

115
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,799
maybe it was a robbery, but he had money

116
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,840
on him. His watch was still on him. It

117
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,400
it just it defied logic to us because he

118
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,480
wasn't that type of man that would have,

119
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,920
you know, that kind of hate directed at

120
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,959
him, that kind of violence, that kind of

121
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,879
brutality.

122
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,200
>> So, up next, what happened the morning

123
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,560
Dr. Telworth died? The detective solves

124
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,879
the case using his exceptional memory.

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,640
That's detective Pat Posigleion. He's

126
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,120
investigated the death of Dr. Gil

127
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,120
Telawir, who owned a used car dealership

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,799
until he was found brutally murdered in

129
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
his office. Now, there were several

130
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,639
clues that pointed in different

131
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,360
directions, but Detective Postigleion

132
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,560
used what some call his photographic

133
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,320
memory to solve the case. Detective Pat

134
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
Postle is here today, as well as Dr.

135
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,479
Telware's daughter, Lisa. When you first

136
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,759
met Detective Pigleon, what was your

137
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,360
impression of him?

138
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
>> You know, it was such a difficult moment

139
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,600
for our family and we were so broken. We

140
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,680
were griefstricken. And the thing that

141
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,880
struck me about Detective Postigleon is

142
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,280
his otherworldly calm. He was absolutely

143
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,120
calm. And then he started to ask us

144
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,720
questions and his questions were so

145
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,320
thoughtful.

146
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
My sense of it was he wanted to

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,080
understand who my father was, not just

148
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,840
the forensic

149
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,199
information. He was genuinely interested

150
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,639
in who my father was.

151
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,880
>> Detective, can you describe what you

152
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,360
remember about a crime scene? Take this

153
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,639
one specifically when you arrived.

154
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
>> Well, I recall I got called out. It

155
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,400
happened to be my daughter's birthday.

156
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,560
Uh I got called out there and uh the

157
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,039
victim was lying, her dad was lying on

158
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,560
his right shoulder. His arm was

159
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,720
extended. His eyeglasses were in his

160
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,520
hand. His finger was pointed toward the

161
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,360
window. Um, there was a blood pattern

162
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,880
there that told me where the victim was

163
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,000
shot and where the victim ended up. It

164
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,000
looked like he had actually been in a

165
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,960
running position when he had fallen to

166
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,240
the ground. I clearly recall that.

167
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,919
>> So, a fair amount of detail. Now,

168
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,400
detective particular says he remembers

169
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,560
practically everything about a homicide

170
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,280
case, including the crime scene itself,

171
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,880
people, interviews, weapons, you know,

172
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,199
everything. doesn't even take written

173
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
notes because he retains it all right

174
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,680
here. It's the main tool he says he has

175
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,280
used to solve hundreds of cases. I'm

176
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,039
curious because I think all of us might

177
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,919
be able to harvest that power that you

178
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,600
seem to have

179
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,120
>> in just dealing with everyday issues. If

180
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,639
you can solve crimes, we should we

181
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,039
should be able to find our keys.

182
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,280
>> So, can you describe how your memory

183
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,800
works in a crime scene? When you first

184
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,919
encounter it, how do you begin to

185
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
process it?

186
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,880
>> Well, when I when I go into a crime

187
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
scene, first of all, I got to get the

188
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,600
permission and blessing from the crime

189
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
scene investigators. And once I'm

190
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
allowed to get inside the crime scene, I

191
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,440
make it my business to spend many hours

192
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,880
inside the scene. The longer I stay

193
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,800
inside the scene, the more sense the

194
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,080
scene begins to make to me. And I make

195
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,280
it a point because we don't know what's

196
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,360
relevant. We don't know what's

197
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,199
irrelevant. So, we look at everything as

198
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,720
potential evidence. And then what we do

199
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
is when we're finished with all that and

200
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,240
I leave, I understand everything that

201
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,600
I've looked at and I recall everything

202
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
that I looked at. And if it turns out to

203
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,120
be irrelevant, we didn't lose a thing.

204
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,520
So I recall every single thing because

205
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,360
down the road something that may be

206
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,919
initially irrelevant may end up being

207
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,000
relevant.

208
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
>> So do you think your memor is actually

209
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,880
better than an actual photograph of the

210
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,600
scene?

211
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,360
>> I would say that my me I could recall a

212
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,759
scene and then I could compare it to a

213
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
photograph of that same scene with my

214
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,720
memory and typically it's exactly the

215
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,319
same.

216
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
>> So in Dr. Telawar's case, Detective

217
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,720
Posigleion zeroed in on two suspects who

218
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,520
were at the scene of the crime. Ronnie

219
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,599
Aller and Terry Blandford, right? Dr.

220
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,759
Telawir had hired both of these men to

221
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,599
work at his car dealership. Lisa, did

222
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
you know either of these two men had did

223
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,280
you see them around the dealership?

224
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,039
>> One of the things I would do is I would

225
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,800
go and visit my father for lunch either

226
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,800
at his offices at the university or at

227
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
the car dealership. And I do remember

228
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
seeing them there, you know, daddy

229
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,319
giving them instructions, go do this

230
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,319
with this vehicle or that vehicle, but

231
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,080
just only in passing. I never had any

232
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,680
face tof face or one-on-one interaction

233
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
with them. So what frustrated

234
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,880
authorities, as both of you know, but

235
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,599
you should all know in the audience, is

236
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,199
that these two suspects, they were

237
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,720
pointing the finger at each other,

238
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,440
saying the other guy was the actual

239
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,599
shooter.

240
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,919
>> So I want Detective Pat to show us how

241
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,000
his memory come on up. Determined who

242
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,560
actually pulled the trigger, who was the

243
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,680
actual perpetrator. Remember both guys,

244
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,759
potential culprits. This is the crime

245
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
scene, the outside of the office and

246
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,199
inside of which Dr. Teller was shot and

247
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
killed. So, detective, as I look at this

248
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,000
picture and audience, let's just do this

249
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,759
all together. When you look at this

250
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,560
picture, can you tell which of these two

251
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,680
men killed Dr. Telwir?

252
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,440
>> Because I'm looking at this and I'm not

253
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,800
quite sure what to focus on.

254
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,120
>> So, you know, help us. Is it using your

255
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
your photographic memory and your

256
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,520
detective skills? What do you see here?

257
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,960
>> Well, when I look at the backside here,

258
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
the first thing I notice is the size of

259
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,879
the windows.

260
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,199
>> The size of the windows,

261
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,400
>> right?

262
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,000
>> All right. Let's zoom in on them. How

263
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,960
what are the sizes? The size of the

264
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
window is 24 in by 26 in this way.

265
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,199
>> You memorized that. You

266
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,640
>> I did. Yes.

267
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,959
>> All right. So, what about that size?

268
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,719
Where is

269
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,320
>> Well, the size of the window. We knew

270
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,000
there was a break in the window and we

271
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,519
knew that the person that entered, we

272
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120
knew there was no forced entry. We knew

273
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,279
that the suspect came in through the

274
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,680
window and killed Goelwa. We knew this.

275
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,600
>> All right.

276
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,160
>> Based on the evidence. So, because the

277
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,959
window was 26 in high, 24 in wide, we

278
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,959
knew that

279
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,800
>> not anyone could fit in that window. So,

280
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,399
we had to make the deduction as to the

281
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,040
size of the person that went into that

282
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,279
window. And how big were these two men?

283
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,880
>> Well, Ronnie Allah, for example, was was

284
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,320
350 pounds.

285
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,680
>> That's him, Ronnie.

286
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,760
>> So, I'm here to tell you that Ronnie

287
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,880
Allah didn't fit in that window. Um,

288
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,480
Terry Blandford is 146 pounds. And as

289
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
soon as I saw Terry Blandford and I

290
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
looked at him face to face, I knew right

291
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
then that he was a shooter of Mr.

292
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,760
Telwire.

293
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,560
>> So, this is the killer.

294
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,360
>> That's the killer.

295
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,720
>> Pulled the trigger. Anyway,

296
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,000
>> he's a shooter. Yes, sir.

297
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,680
>> You got that all from the memory of

298
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,160
having walked around the crime site,

299
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,440
>> right? I did. I I I mean I spend a lot

300
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,279
of time inside the scene with the

301
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,880
victim. That's typically what I do.

302
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,320
That's what most homicide detectives do.

303
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,160
You spend a lot of time inside the crime

304
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,920
scene. The longer you spend in time this

305
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,440
inside the scene, the more sense the

306
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,680
scene makes to you.

307
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
>> And what happened to these person? Did

308
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,399
they both went to jail? One of them went

309
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,040
to jail. What happened?

310
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,800
>> Uh one pled and got life plus 20 years.

311
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,480
One went to trial and got convicted and

312
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,440
he also got life. So they're both in

313
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,800
prison right now.

314
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,920
>> Oh, so they were working together but

315
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,279
only one guy killed him,

316
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,519
>> right? One guy went in, the other one

317
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,560
was driving around. waiting for him to

318
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
come out.

319
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,200
>> And what what were they trying to do?

320
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,600
What were they trying to get?

321
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,600
>> It was a a robbery situation. Um but

322
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,120
apparently they were determined to kill

323
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,320
the victim and that's precisely what

324
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
they did. So

325
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
>> Oh my goodness. Yeah.

326
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
>> I'm so sorry you had to hear that here

327
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,080
again, but I'm sure you've witnessed it

328
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,399
at the court.

329
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,399
>> No, no. We're so grateful that we were

330
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,720
that we had a successful investigation

331
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,079
and a successful prosecution. So it's

332
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,399
it's not a problem to hear about it

333
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,160
again.

334
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,480
>> It brought some closure to your family.

335
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,480
>> It gave us our father back. Dr. Oz,

336
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,920
because for us, you know, if we hadn't

337
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
had that, and I don't know how families

338
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,600
deal with it that don't get that kind of

339
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,040
closure because all I would have ever

340
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,720
thought about when I thought about my

341
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
father was how he died. That's what I

342
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,480
would have been left with.

343
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,560
>> So, we were very, very fortunate to have

344
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,399
Detective Pigleó and his team do what

345
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,480
they did for us because the last 29

346
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,560
years, I've been able to enjoy the

347
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,880
memories of my father without that hurt,

348
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,959
without that pain of not having a

349
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,200
successful investigation. And detective

350
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,880
put let me pry a little into your

351
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,880
photographic memory. A lot of the crime

352
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,200
scenes that you must be investigating,

353
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,279
hundreds of them, they're brutal, right?

354
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,720
You get so much into them, you

355
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,320
essentially are reliving them because

356
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,399
they're in your mind like pictures.

357
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,920
>> Is that a heavy burden at times? I

358
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,160
>> I mean it it's kind of like a blessing

359
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,320
and a curse scenario where the blessing

360
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,640
part of it is because of my memory, it's

361
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,959
helped me solve uh some homicides over

362
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,200
the years. Uh and and that's a good

363
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,200
thing. Uh the other side is the curse

364
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,120
part is the fact that these cases bubble

365
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200
up from time to time and and I actually

366
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
it's almost like I'm right there again.

367
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,640
But that's okay. I mean I accept that. I

368
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,399
understand that and and I'll take the

369
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,000
blessings over the curse and I think the

370
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,519
blessings do outweigh the curse.

371
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,640
>> Well, thank you for both being here and

372
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,079
