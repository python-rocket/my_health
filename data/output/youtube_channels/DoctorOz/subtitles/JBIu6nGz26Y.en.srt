1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,720
What would you do if you were face to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,240
face with an intruder? Now this is a

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,160
weapon that you can use. When you walk

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,960
into your house, this is how you walk in

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,679
just in case. And Lisa Lampanelli shines

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,320
a powerful light on fat shaming. No one

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,640
ever made permanent good change by being

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,279
yelled at or yelling at themselves.

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,920
Plus, helpful home tips from Leila Ali.

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,540
To have organization in your home does

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,690
wonders. Coming up next.

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,200
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,709
I love you, Da.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,360
Welcome to the show.

20
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,720
I may have just made a big mistake. I

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,640
bet many of you would have made the same

22
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,400
mistake. Putting myself at risk.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
According to my guest, security expert

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,720
and author of the new book, Prepared,

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,720
Not Scared, Bill Sten. He's here in

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,119
person. What did I do wrong? Well, Doc,

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,080
the first and potential last mistake you

28
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,479
made was coming outside that door. You

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,840
came out and unless you specifically

30
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,520
know who's on the other side of that

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,600
door, I don't care if it's the butcher,

32
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,960
the baker, the candlestick maker, you

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,960
know there are bad people out there.

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
Now, my initials are BS. There are too

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,159
many bad guys out there looking to throw

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
it your way. So, today show everyone

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,079
it's about being safe in what sometimes

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,520
seems like an unsafe world. But you

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,280
don't have to run scared as long as

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,799
you're prepared. So being prepared not

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,479
only keeps us safe but it also gives us

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,640
a sense of control of our lives. Gives

43
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,159
us calmness in the face of disaster as

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
well as reducing your fear and anxiety

45
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,240
because you know what guys we fear most

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,320
or we don't understand. So you here to

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,079
prepare us with some common scenario

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,680
defenses things that happen all the

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,560
time. Why did you pick the ones you

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,640
picked? Well doc what happens is we

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
don't rise to the occasion in times of

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,120
stress. Studies have shown we default to

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,840
our training and that's what this book

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,319
goes to. It gives you actionable tips

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,720
how to be situationally aware and how to

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,319
be prepared, not scared, if tragedy

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,680
strikes. These are all common scenarios.

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,680
So, Ashley's going to start us off.

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
She's a single mom, wants to be better

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,760
prepared to protect her family and

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,440
herself. How much anxiety do you have

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,840
about a stranger entering your home? And

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,519
we see these reports daily now. Well, as

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
you said, I'm a single mother of two

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,000
girls, and every time I hear a noise in

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,680
the house, I become startled and alert.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,480
So, I just want to be prepared just in

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,080
case. Okay, Bill. bad guy enters the

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,840
home, what's she supposed to do? Okay,

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,599
it's about having the proper mindset.

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,440
Now, Ashley and I have rehearsed this a

72
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,200
little bit. So, don't be startled

73
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,720
because she is now prepared. She's not

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,319
going to be scared. So, most attacks

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
come from behind. So, if someone's going

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
to come back, they're not going to go

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
nice. You know what? Do it from over

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,720
here cuz I want everyone at home to see.

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,920
This is really cool stuff. If someone's

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,440
going to come up, it's going to be it's

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,400
going to be really hard. And she's going

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,800
to do what?

83
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,319
And what's going to happen is she Wait,

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
hold on. Hold on. All right. What she's

85
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,640
going to do, what she did was she found

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,720
transitional space. If she found a way

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,640
to get me away and she did that groin

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,720
strike, thank you, doc, for that. She

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,000
does that groin strike. She knows how to

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,599
get out of dodge. She's going to do

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,360
that. Now, if you're walking to the

92
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,800
door, you have keys. Good habits are

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,560
hard to break, just like bad ones.

94
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,519
You're going to go like this, and if you

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,680
don't have the keys, you're going to

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,640
strike and then rake the face with your

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,280
nails. Why? Because you've now just

98
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,519
identified that person with their DNA.

99
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,440
So, they run, they take off. We know who

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,480
they are. They go to jail. It's like a

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,640
horror film. But if you don't mind, I I

102
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,640
That happened so fast for me. I want to

103
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,239
do that again one more time. Really

104
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,480
strike hard this time. No, seriously.

105
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
Thank you, Doc.

106
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,200
Now, I actually want you to go slowmo

107
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,640
cuz I want to show people what you did.

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,840
So, first of all, so you be Bill, you be

109
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,120
the intruder. She comes up. So, she's

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
going to make herself big, right? So,

111
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,720
you do that means you put your arms

112
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,840
apart and take a deep breath there.

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,040
That's right. Now, she's going to drop a

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,280
little bit. She's going to come with her

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,840
fist and as hard as she can. Boom. Oh,

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,400
jeez.

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,120
All right. It works. It works. All

118
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,880
right. We went over that, right? She

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,720
said, "You trained her too well." All

120
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,120
right. Yes. That was very good. Okay.

121
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,440
So, now if Now I'm going to give her the

122
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,919
keys. If she's walking to the door and I

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,080
come up from from from up front. Let's

124
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,240
not make a mistake this time. So, you're

125
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,680
going to strike right to the face. Boom.

126
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,040
Right. Right. Now, where the keys? No,

127
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
the keys got to be down. Keys are in the

128
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,600
fingers interlaced. Right. And she's

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,600
going to strike straight to my face.

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,840
Right. And now I'm I'm gonna show that

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
for a second. What I'm hearing, see this

132
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,960
is not quite what I'm It has to be in

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,320
Right. Because what you're saying is

134
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,520
when we walk into our house, when you

135
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,880
walk into your house, you're going to

136
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,720
take your keys and you're going to do

137
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,440
what he's doing now. Inter. So one key

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,520
in in between. No. Yes. You can go into

139
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,120
as many keys as you have. Right now,

140
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,199
this is a weapon, right, that you can

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,800
use. Can everyone see that? From now on,

142
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,639
when you walk into your house, this is

143
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
how you walk in. Just in case you have

144
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,360
the keys in your hand anyway, instead of

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,720
holding it inside your hand where it

146
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,880
can't help you, do what Bill's doing.

147
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,000
You channel your inner wolverine and you

148
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,000
come right to the face, eyes, nose,

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,240
clavicle, right? And then if you have

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,199
the time, you rake their face. You have

151
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,160
that I you have that DNA identifier and

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,680
you just run. Don't stay to engage. You

153
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,960
run. You get out of dodge. All right.

154
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,400
So, how does that make you feel just

155
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,840
hearing this? And I I bring this up

156
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,600
because years ago, I I remember uh going

157
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,360
to a school and they were having big

158
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,639
problems with assault, right? And my

159
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,479
wife was the one who said, you know, you

160
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,759
can teach to women how to run away, but

161
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,840
maybe better teach them how to defend

162
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
themselves so it's not just a one-sided

163
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,360
threat. Does this make you feel more

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,440
comfortable? I feel more prepared, a lot

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,240
more comfortable, more confident. And

166
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,759
from now on, I want everyone at home,

167
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,120
you get those keys out, do what Bill

168
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,320
just did. You don't have to meticulously

169
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,400
do it every single time. We've all got

170
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,919
keys. Put them the right way and and

171
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,600
have them there just to protect any form

172
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,600
like that. Good habits are hard to

173
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,080
break, just like bad ones. And your

174
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,840
mindset coupled with the knowledge will

175
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,280
make you prepared, not scared. Right,

176
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,960
Ashley? Thank you very much. Thank you.

177
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,199
All right, our next be prepared scenario

178
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,120
also involves the front door and some

179
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
conmen in uniform. You're not going to

180
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,880
believe this.

181
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,520
Police want you to be on the lookout for

182
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,360
this guy. Police say he is posing as a

183
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,000
utility worker and he's trying to get

184
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,080
inside people's homes. Police report

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,080
last month two men in a dark collared

186
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,240
vehicle tried to get inside homes,

187
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,759
claiming they worked with the utility.

188
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,160
Police say two men posed as PGW workers

189
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,720
before attacking and robbing a man who

190
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,280
let them in his home. This is home

191
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,680
surveillance video showing conmen who

192
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,319
gained entry posing as water company

193
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,800
employees. Watch as one distracts the

194
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,280
homeowner while the other sneaks into

195
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,600
another room looking for valuables.

196
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,479
These two men came to the door of an

197
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,720
unsuspecting teen home alone. When he

198
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,160
answered, they forced their way in. He

199
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,120
was uh beaten and tied with zip ties and

200
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,280
clothing. A third suspect was shown on

201
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,160
security cameras leaving with plastic

202
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,880
bags. According to police, the suspects

203
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,199
got away with more than $200,000 worth

204
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
of cash, jewelry, and personal

205
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
valuables.

206
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
That's some scary stuff. So, here's the

207
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,440
question. How do you look past the

208
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,360
uniform and find that if someone on our

209
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
doorstep is legitimate? What what's

210
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,520
what's what am I supposed to do when

211
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,440
someone walks up there and says they're

212
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,319
here to check the gas? Well, the famous

213
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,960
saying, trust but verify. Same thing

214
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,440
applies here. Use your mindset. You see

215
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,599
someone at the door. What you do is you

216
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
want to say, "Let me see your ID." You

217
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,280
want to have your phone ready to call

218
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,000
and you may want to come to con man. You

219
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,919
may want to say, "Hold your ID up cuz we

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,680
have a camera." You may not have a

221
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,759
camera, but they don't know that. And

222
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
you monitor how they react. Yeah. No

223
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,919
one's going to stick around if they

224
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
think you're calling their boss and they

225
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,039
don't have one. Exactly. All right.

226
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,039
Let's go outside for our last scenario.

227
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,479
Bobbing a car. Not. You never know.

228
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,960
Never know. You might need to be

229
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,800
prepared just in case the worst happens.

230
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,199
This past winter, a man in Oregon was

231
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,120
trapped in his car during a snowstorm

232
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,800
for 5 days surviving on guess what? Taco

233
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,400
Bell hot sauce. That's all he ape. Now,

234
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
it tastes good. I get it. But that's not

235
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
what you want to do voluntarily. So, our

236
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,039
next scenario is going to teach you what

237
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,520
you should do if you find yourself

238
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,720
trapped in a car after an accident. Bill

239
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,240
says, "Your car can actually be your

240
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,160
best friend when it comes to being

241
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,639
prepared for life. You should outfit it

242
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,919
for survival." So, this is your car.

243
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,160
That's right. I like the license plate,

244
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,840
by the way. I I love it. Vanity. So,

245
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,000
what we have on our person, we should

246
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,800
have what's called an everyday carry. I

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,719
say do this to the car. This every car

248
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,719
should be different where you live, but

249
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,360
this should have the staples. Every car

250
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,800
should have protein bars. They should

251
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,720
have a flashlight, a first aid kit, you

252
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,640
have duct tape. Now, this is very

253
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,399
important. This is a seat belt cutter.

254
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,560
You have it in the front of the car. And

255
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,399
a jug of water. These things should be

256
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
in every car and where you live.

257
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
Depending if you live in a desert, in a

258
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
cold area, you may want to have a

259
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,279
blanket or water purifier, things like

260
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,640
that. Right? So, all the essentials, put

261
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,800
them in a little bucket, easy to cart

262
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,560
around. Now, Bill wants to use his cell

263
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,640
phone to show us his next demonstration.

264
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
How to escape from the trunk of a car if

265
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,680
you have been kidnapped. Now, if you

266
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,000
think it'll never happen to you, well,

267
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,160
think again because this Alabama woman

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,279
was making her brave escape. Happily

269
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,720
caught caught on video, but

270
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,720
unbelievably, she was in the in the back

271
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
of the trunk. All right, Bill, you ready

272
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,519
with this? Let's do it. Get in the

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,760
trunk. Explain what we're going to do.

274
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,120
Okay, so in case you're ever put in this

275
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,600
trunk for whatever reason, you're going

276
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,519
to go in and if it closes, if you're

277
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,600
taken, if you're here by mistake or on

278
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
purpose, you're going to find that Well,

279
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,040
hold a second. Do Do I You want You sure

280
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,560
I'm going to close this? Let's give it a

281
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,880
shot. Okay. I'm sure that Ready? 3 2

282
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,959
Deep breath in. All right. So, I'm in

283
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,680
the trunk and I'm quickly looking. I

284
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,839
need to find that exit. There it is.

285
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,480
Pull it. Kick it open.

286
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,959
And I'm out to freedom. You survived.

287
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,640
Who would have thought? Oh my goodness.

288
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,640
I was counting on you coming back. All

289
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,000
right. He made it. You can, too. It's

290
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,760
super simple. I never knew that little

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,200
catch was there, but they're there.

292
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,560
They're simple. They're put there for a

293
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,240
reason. Not like the old movies when you

294
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,920
get stuck and they get cart your way

295
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,360
everywhere. Anyway, up next, Bill is

296
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,040
sticking around to show you how to

297
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,520
survive a dog attack because they

298
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,940
happen.

299
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,350
[Applause]

300
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,840
[Music]

301
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,840
[Applause]

302
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,160
Over 100 young men mysteriously drowned.

303
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,079
All death ruled accidental. There's GHB

304
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,160
in in the system. The date rape drug,

305
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,160
but some say it's the work of the smiley

306
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,079
face killers. This is a big idea. The

307
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,880
theory there's a gang of serial killers.

308
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,920
An Oz true crime investigation. Plus,

309
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,000
love after lockup when your soulmate is

310
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,000
an inmate. What is it about men who are

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,959
incarcerated that attracts you next? Oz,

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,880
that's coming up tomorrow.

313
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,279
We've got good news and bad news. Well,

314
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,440
first, welcome to your home. And here's

315
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,000
the thing. I walked around. I did a

316
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,839
security check and the lower windows,

317
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,920
everything seems up locked nice and

318
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,920
tight. But then I noticed a ladder on

319
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,839
the side of your house. So, what I'm

320
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,480
going to do is I'm going to use your

321
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,720
everyday item tool as a weapon against

322
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,560
you. Don't worry. The doc and the good

323
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,720
people at the Dr. Oz show said they got

324
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,720
this covered. So, here we go.

325
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,320
Oh, so the window's open. It's just a

326
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,760
screen. That's This is a screen.

327
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,839
What? Is that right? You left the window

328
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,839
open. Yes. Not just unlocked. You left

329
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,800
it open. It's like an invitation.

330
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,320
Oh my. He's inside the house. So, I'm

331
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,600
inside.

332
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,120
You see how easy that was? Yes.

333
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,880
All right. So, we're back with police

334
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,240
officer Bill Stanton who's here making

335
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
sure we're prepared to stay safe. That

336
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,040
was Bill breaking into one of our

337
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,440
audience members' home. Now, he's about

338
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,200
to recreate a real life dog attack so

339
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,640
you can survive if it happens to you.

340
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,320
Now, I want to say this. We're all big

341
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,399
dog lovers here. I've got my little

342
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,480
Khesi doesn't attack anybody. But most

343
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,959
of our furry pals are friendly, right?

344
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,959
We all know that. But there are some off

345
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,040
chance dog attacks. They happen. We want

346
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,040
you to be prepared for your safety and

347
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,399
for the safety of the animal involved.

348
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,920
So, we're at a park. We're going to

349
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,920
recreate it here. We have, you know,

350
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,519
let's say we got the kid with us and we

351
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,440
see a dog and this this is and we think

352
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,120
it's getting ready to attack us. What do

353
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,880
we do? Well, it's called situational

354
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
awareness. You want to see the trouble

355
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,560
before it's coming. So, you want to put

356
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,800
your body in front of your child and

357
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,440
make yourself big. You want to yell and

358
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,279
try scare the dog away and let that dog

359
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,639
know who's in charge. And why do you

360
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,399
turn sideways like that? Well, you want

361
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,720
to cover your vital organs. You want to

362
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,800
give you want to present just the thing

363
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,120
that is, you know, you want to give that

364
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
arm so you protect everything else. and

365
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
your child. All right. And if it doesn't

366
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,000
happen, what what do you do then? Well,

367
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,519
then doc, you got to take the hit. Take

368
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
the hit. You got to take the hit from

369
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,839
the dog. Let the dog attack you. You're

370
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,560
gonna let that dog attack you because

371
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,480
you know what you have is priceless.

372
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,680
Your child, you know, I love the way you

373
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,920
explain that, but I don't know.

374
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,360
Audience, you want to just see this,

375
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
right? I mean, you want to show and tell

376
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,040
it, not just tell it. Why am I not

377
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
surprised, Doc? Did you take the hit for

378
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,480
us? I'll take the hit for you. All

379
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,959
right. Go ahead. Let's do the show and

380
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,959
tell. So, so now now the the mindset is

381
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:16,920
there's is an adore coming and we see

382
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,920
that dog. No, back back

383
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:25,519
go.

384
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:28,519
[Applause]

385
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,519
Okay.

386
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,519
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Hold

387
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:38,399
that dog. She is not happy with you at

388
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,360
all. So, you're hoping Well, big hand

389
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,680
for Quella by the way. Quella,

390
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,079
I just say Quella is not really an

391
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,160
attack dog. She's beautiful and she

392
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,760
actually from our friends from Kines's

393
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,839
for Cops. Kines's for Cops has donated

394
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,399
police dogs over 200 communities and

395
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,920
removed $300 million worth of contraband

396
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,560
off the street. So, thank you for being

397
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,240
here for keeping us safe. But be all

398
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,160
that said and done, Quao was pretty

399
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,320
effective in ripping your arm off. Yes.

400
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,440
And what we have to hope for is that

401
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
someone's going to see this, whether

402
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,199
it's an owner or a bystander, and

403
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,279
they're going to safeguard your child,

404
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,880
and then eventually that dog will leave

405
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,199
you alone. Right, Bill, thank you very

406
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,279
much for helping us always. His book,

407
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,880
Prepare, Not Scare. It's available now.

408
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,640
Check it out. We'll be right back. Thank

409
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,120
you, sir.

410
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,120
[Applause]

411
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,880
Funny lady, Lisa Lampanelli is now a

412
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,040
life coach. Stay tuned as she helps twin

413
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,519
sisters stuck in a fat shaming loop.

414
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,980
Willie, we're going to fix it up. I

415
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:39,760
trust her. Yep.

416
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,839
[Applause]

417
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,480
There's a lot of anger in the world

418
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,959
these days. Bullying and fat shaming,

419
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,120
insults, and this all too familiar

420
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,440
language is genuinely unhealthy.

421
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,440
Something funny lady Lisa Lampanelli

422
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,639
knows all too well. She's been on both

423
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,560
sides of it until now. Lisa says she's

424
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,279
had enough and wants to help others

425
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,240
cope. She's been coined America's queen

426
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,800
of mean. Lisa Lampanelli was the funny

427
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,680
plus-sized gal of comedy. She rose from

428
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,000
stand-up comic to stardom with her bold,

429
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,720
shocking, and brutally honest humor.

430
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,760
That came out wrong. And Lampinelli

431
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,480
scares no one, including herself. In 6

432
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,240
months of dieting, I have lost three

433
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,399
lbs.

434
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,880
writing candidly about her struggles

435
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,199
with food and weight in her best-selling

436
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,519
book, Chocolate, Please, about her

437
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,160
battle with the bulge.

438
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,560
At nearly 50, Lisa went under the knife

439
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,360
to have a drastic weight loss procedure,

440
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,160
a gastric sleeve that she hoped would

441
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,560
help her finally shed the weight.

442
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,519
Since the surgery, Lisa Lampanelli has

443
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,160
lost over 100 lbs, and made a few other

444
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,839
changes. She changed up her classic

445
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,839
blonde look, got divorced, and shocked

446
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,279
the comedy community with her decision

447
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,759
to retire from the mic for good. Today,

448
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,839
Lisa Lampanelli shares her remarkable

449
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,720
journey, stepping out of the comedy

450
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,040
spotlight and into her new role as a

451
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,680
life coach.

452
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,120
So, let me show you all what Lisa looked

453
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,880
like before. There's a before picture.

454
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,600
She was a beautiful soul, right? But she

455
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,130
wasn't happy in her body. Here is the

456
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,300
new Lisa. Come on out.

457
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:28,440
[Applause]

458
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,440
[Music]

459
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,839
Oh my goodness. So happy.

460
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,639
Look at you. Look at you. Oh, thank you.

461
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,199
I'm so happy to be here.

462
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,199
Please say happy family.

463
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,639
I like the energy of movement. It's you

464
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,320
can see it in your eyes. Oh, I love it.

465
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,680
There's so much more joy in life when

466
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,519
you actually like what you're doing and

467
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,600
you feel better about yourself. And you

468
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,000
know, obviously you shed the hair. Yes.

469
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,240
You shed the weight. She shed a husband.

470
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,680
You should know, right?

471
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,160
Walk us through how this transformed

472
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,240
you. You know what was wild was I

473
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,400
started working on the weight and I came

474
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,240
on the fir first time I was on here. We

475
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,760
talked about no more emotional eating.

476
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,839
Working on that. That's the hardest part

477
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,720
of this whole thing. And as I stopped

478
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,079
stuffing my emotions with food, I

479
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
started figuring out, oh my god, I'm not

480
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,000
that happy in my marriage and we broke

481
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,679
up amicably. Then I was like, well,

482
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,880
comedy really isn't giving me that joy

483
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,120
it used to. And helping people, I'm

484
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,280
telling you, there is nothing like it. I

485
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,640
get on a I'm doing Oh my god, it's so

486
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,120
much fun.

487
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,559
Oh, I just feel like every coaching

488
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,480
session with someone gives me that joy

489
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,039
it used to as when I first started the

490
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,880
standup, but better because it actually

491
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,880
hopefully is making a change in people's

492
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,840
lives. So, by the way, she her 10year

493
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,000
challenge. Take a look at this picture

494
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,160
if you don't mind. This is your #10ear

495
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
challenge which you just posted. You're

496
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,559
fantastic.

497
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,240
And you have always been uh willing to

498
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,320
talk about food and the relationship

499
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,160
issues. That must have changed

500
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,720
dramatically now. Oh my god. so much

501
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,799
because when you get beriatric surgery,

502
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,400
if you work on the emotional eating, you

503
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,799
really figure out, wow, it was never

504
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,880
about food. It wasn't that I loved food

505
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,000
and that I was always hungry. No, the

506
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,919
fact was I was using food to medicate,

507
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,919
just like people use alcohol or drugs or

508
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,320
shopping or anything else. And what was

509
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,440
so cool is now that I'm not doing that,

510
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,360
I go, "Boy, this is kind of still hard,

511
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
but every day it gets a little better."

512
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,120
And every day you still have to work on

513
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,400
it. It never ends. I may be 80 and still

514
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,960
working on it, but at least I'm working

515
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,640
on it. Well, you say the word work, but

516
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,919
for most people when I I think of work,

517
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,720
work is a whole different kind of

518
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,760
escape. And and you use comedy. Yeah.

519
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,000
Not just as a as a profession, but you

520
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,000
also could use your comedic talent to as

521
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,160
a solve. Oh, absolutely. To deal with a

522
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,400
lot of this and you decide to give it

523
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,960
up. That's pretty risky. Well, the risk

524
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
was only if I stayed in because I didn't

525
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,559
want to do something that didn't have

526
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,039
that happiness and joy for me. This is

527
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,960
how I deal with life. People, I say,

528
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,200
"What's the worst that can happen?" But

529
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,280
then I do it anyway. A lot of people let

530
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,799
that talk them out of doing something.

531
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,520
Me, I said, "What's the worst that can

532
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,520
happen? I never make another penny. I

533
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,520
sell my house. I move in with my mother.

534
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,679
God bless her. Hopefully, I'll be in the

535
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,120
will and I'll get the house." And then

536
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,480
you go, "You know what? That's the worst

537
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,640
that could happen. You're with your mom.

538
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,039
It's always Yeah. If if if you have to

539
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,640
go down to a certain little tiny

540
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,160
apartment, who cares if what you do

541
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,799
every day brings you a little bit of

542
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,600
love, you know? So, when you have the

543
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,880
usual ups and downs in life, Yeah.

544
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
What's your hack? How do you Normally,

545
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,440
you just throw a joke out there,

546
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,280
everyone would sort of decant it and

547
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,120
you'd be okay. Well, not only that,

548
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,640
usually I'd eat or throw out a joke. So,

549
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,960
those were my two ways of sort of like

550
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,000
distancing myself from my emotions. Get

551
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,280
this. Now, when I have a uncomfortable

552
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,559
feeling, I have to feel it. There is

553
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,039
nothing worse than having to cry, having

554
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,360
to be really truly frustrated, angry,

555
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,840
lonely, and then guess what though? They

556
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,440
say you have to feel it to heal it. It

557
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,840
ends up it's not that bad. You live

558
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,080
anyway. And do I succeed all the time?

559
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,559
Hell no. I'm always going, you know

560
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,400
what? 20% of the day I probably don't do

561
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,320
the right thing with food or anything

562
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,480
else, but at least that's why I wore

563
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,600
that shirt that said work in progress

564
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,039
because I'm always going to be doing

565
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,880
that. Well, let me your your approach to

566
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,400
feeling it because a lot of the crazy

567
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,880
things people do is because they want to

568
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,240
feel life. A lot of you sitting around

569
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,480
right now watching this program are

570
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,280
thinking I I just I feel dead. I feel

571
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
dull. Feeling it actually does reawaken

572
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,080
you because we're supposed to have that

573
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,600
there. So, we're talking about body

574
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,840
image issues a lot these days in

575
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,600
America. And you went through a period

576
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,440
when you weren't in the body you wanted

577
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,600
to be in, which is your business, not

578
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,600
anyone else's. Were you ever fat shamed?

579
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,520
Oh god. The minute I discovered this

580
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,039
Twitter and this Facebook, I had to do

581
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,120
it professionally. I don't do it

582
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,120
personally. I had to do it for Oh, my

583
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,120
own. Every time you say some joke they

584
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,120
don't like, they call you names. They

585
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,840
get on you. I was very thin skinned at

586
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,760
the time. Now, now, thank goodness I've

587
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,960
worked on liking myself more. So, you

588
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,880
could throw at me whatever you want

589
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,720
because I kind of laugh about it because

590
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,679
I'm like super pretty and it doesn't

591
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,159
really matter. So, but that's the weird

592
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,159
thing. No.

593
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,799
But it's weird like once you start

594
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,320
working on the internals, you start

595
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,240
liking the externals better and you go,

596
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,480
"Oh, you just said I was ugly and old on

597
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,000
Facebook." That's okay. I I throw

598
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,240
compassion at them to be honest with

599
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,240
you. I ignore it and they say, "Whatever

600
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,120
happens is fine. Your words are

601
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,799
powerful, your spirit undaunted. You're

602
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,640
the kind of person who changes the

603
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,240
world. We all have the power, but you're

604
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,559
actually doing it." A thank you. Would

605
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,600
you be willing because you've been there

606
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,360
to help me with a couple guests? Mhm. I

607
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,760
want to do a little intervention. Sure.

608
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,600
And this is an intervention between two

609
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:52,240
sisters. And they're fat shaming. Oh

610
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,880
wow. That's rough. Each other. Oh boy.

611
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
Which is not what I would have expected.

612
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,159
But if even sisters can do it, we all

613
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,320
might be doing it without realizing it.

614
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,200
So this is Lexi and her twin sister

615
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,120
Mandy. They are both 40. They still do

616
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,520
almost everything together. They even

617
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,039
live across the street from each other.

618
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,320
But there's something emotional going on

619
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,559
between them that's starting to tear

620
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,320
these sisters apart. And it is the fat

621
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,039
shaming that we started the segment off

622
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,640
with. Lisa's fat shaming. And you going

623
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,240
to do the sister's intervention? Oh,

624
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,720
yeah. Absolutely. You'll see it live

625
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,720
when we come back.

626
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,039
[Music]

627
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,200
[Applause]

628
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,799
We're investigating foods you think are

629
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
healthy. This one happens to have a lot

630
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,200
of artificial sweetener. Oh. But are

631
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,159
there hidden sugar substitutes causing

632
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,159
you to gain weight?

633
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,880
That's coming up Wednesday on Dr. Oz.

634
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,360
So, Mandy called me again tonight and

635
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,440
asked me to come over to exercise with

636
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,080
her.

637
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,799
And my body just cringed. I'm at this

638
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,320
point. I'm just like, "Leave me alone.

639
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,919
Please, just leave me alone." Um, and

640
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,880
she's like, "What did you do today?" I'm

641
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,039
like, "I slept." And she's like, "You're

642
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,559
not gonna lose weight by sleeping." And

643
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,760
that just made me just cringe even more.

644
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,520
She feels great. She's confident. Like I

645
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,240
said, she can walk around, prance

646
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,039
around. Everybody compliments her, can

647
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,640
say things to her all the time. And I

648
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,240
just feel like

649
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,720
and

650
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:34,240
I do feel like all the time, but I just

651
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,280
don't have the energy or the strength to

652
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,360
really do anything about it.

653
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,159
And

654
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,799
I just I I know she wants to help, but

655
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,120
she just doesn't get it.

656
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,440
That's Lexi. She says her sister, her

657
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,880
twin sister Mandy, constantly fat shames

658
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,039
her about her weight. Now, they've been

659
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,039
inseparable since birth and bond over

660
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,039
their shared love of dogs. But fat

661
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,640
shaming, well, it's pulling them apart.

662
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,320
Life coach Lisa Lampanelli is here to

663
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,000
help out. So, Manny, I I look at

664
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,320
pictures of you guys when you're young,

665
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,840
and you seem inseparable. We totally

666
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,919
were. Look at this image. It's

667
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,840
fantastic. When did this riff start

668
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,559
happening between you guys? Probably

669
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,559
about five years ago. Um, some

670
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,720
differences started to come into the

671
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,000
picture. I think when our bodies started

672
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,799
to change and kind of put a little

673
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,400
distance between us. Lexi, you've been

674
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,080
very open and I applaud you for this

675
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,120
about the fact that you have a diagnosis

676
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,320
of being bipolar. Yes, I do. How does

677
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,919
that affect the way you deal with food?

678
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,679
Um, it has a big effect actually because

679
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,960
because of the fact um of the fact that

680
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,640
I do have a bipolar diagnosis. I am on a

681
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,640
lot of medication. And unfortunately,

682
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,080
these medications

683
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,840
um have a side effect of weight gain.

684
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Everything is weight gain, weight gain,

685
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,400
weight gain. And it's not only just

686
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,960
weight gain. Um it causes a lot of binge

687
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,760
eating. So Mandy, you sent us a little

688
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,600
video clip about how you you truly feel

689
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,960
about the situation in Lexi's weight

690
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,159
gain. Can may I play this for everybody?

691
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,320
Yes, you can. Okay.

692
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:17,679
Every day I am trying to help her. Help

693
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,400
her. That's all I'm trying to do. And I

694
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,320
feel like I am getting nowhere. I

695
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,919
understand she's got her daily struggles

696
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,400
because of her illness, because of her

697
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,159
depression, because of her medication,

698
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,039
but honestly, like lately, I feel like

699
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,799
she's using it as a crutch. I've offered

700
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,720
gym memberships. I've offered personal

701
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,960
trainers. I've offered you to come to my

702
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,640
house and use my workout equipment. I've

703
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,279
done it. And honestly, I can't enjoy

704
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,440
what I've achieved right now because

705
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,720
every time somebody compliments me in

706
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,000
front of her, I'm like, "No, no, no, no,

707
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,200
no, no, no. Don't don't don't say

708
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,720
anything in front of her because it's

709
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,400
going to just set her off and make her

710
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,080
upset." And that's the last thing I want

711
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,159
to do is make her upset. And that's why

712
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,679
I'm trying so hard, but she just does

713
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,760
not listen to me. I mean, my family has

714
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,400
said things to me. It's like, what do we

715
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,159
do? Like, we want to help her. So, she's

716
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,360
got to cut and get on this with me. All

717
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,760
right. So, I have a question for each of

718
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:16,159
you. Lexi, how does it make you feel

719
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:21,360
when you hear that? Oh,

720
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:25,440
frustrated. Um, I almost uh want to keep

721
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,960
building that wall up around me and just

722
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,679
pull the covers over and just turn away.

723
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,679
Run away. Manny, what does it say about

724
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,880
you? What are you doing to actually

725
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,799
allow Lexi to to live in the body she

726
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,559
wants to live in? You can give her

727
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,559
something that no one else Lisa can't

728
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,440
give her. I can't give her that only you

729
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,760
can give her cuz she loves you and she

730
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,640
trusts you. She cares about what you

731
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,640
think. Maybe too much. Yeah.

732
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,679
you. It's like you with all your good

733
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,159
intentions and love for her, you need to

734
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,279
be a partner along the journey. And you

735
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,120
know what? No one ever and I I've seen

736
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,159
across the board, no one ever made

737
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,720
permanent good change by being yelled at

738
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,400
or yelling at themselves. So just to sit

739
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,960
and listen and hold her hands

740
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,640
metaphorically and also physically be

741
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,120
like, you know what, be her soft place

742
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,120
to fall. you know, be that person who

743
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,200
helps her dissolve those unworthy

744
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,120
thoughts in her head. So, let's work on

745
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,120
the thoughts. And if you guys I'd love

746
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,279

747
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,679

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,320
champion, Leila Ali, and today we are

765
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,080

766
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,840
punch. That's right. We are bringing you

you'll want to try today. You won't want

769
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,849
to miss it.

770
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,849
[Applause]

771
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,399
My next guest is an undefeated boxing

772
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,360
world champion who learned the power of

773
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,520
giving back from the champ himself. Now,

774
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,120
Leila Ali is using what her dad taught

775
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,120
her to help improve the lives of

776
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,880
families in need of a fix with simple

777
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,840
home and food makeover hacks that you're

778
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,080
going to want to try. We are going to

779
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,520
the kid family. They've got this living

780
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,840
room that needs a little help. It's

781
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,760
beige on top of beige on top of beige.

782
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,279
Cue the transformation team. Tell me

783
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,440
what you don't like about it. We picked

784
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,279
up the furniture at a garage sale. It

785
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,039
was a curb sale. It wasn't even in the

786
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,200
garage. Now this makeover. How you

787
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,440
feeling about this? It looks dangerous.

788
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,240
Will take major skills. It's time to get

789
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,559
the last pieces in place to pull off the

790
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,480
ultimate surprise. It's beautiful.

791
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,760
Please welcome back to the show, Lea

792
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:19,660
Ali.

793
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:19,660
[Applause]

794
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,080
Oh my goodness. How you doing? Nice to

795
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,120
see you. Are we working out today? We

796
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,480
are working out. We'll do everything

797
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,399
with you. You usually make me work out

798
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,039
when I go. Well, I adore having you. The

799
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,480
walk from the from the workout. Exactly.

800
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,840
I'm so proud that you're here and I'm so

801
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,880
proud of your new project. Thank you.

802
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,399
And I love to understand how it carries

803
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,240
on the legacy of your dad because he

804
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,200
really instilled in you this powerful

805
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,440
love, this need to help people who are

806
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,960
in need. Yes. This show, Homemade

807
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,640
Simple, gives me the perfect opportunity

808
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,080
to do the things that I love. We're

809
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,039
working with families that are so

810
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,200
deserving. We might have someone that is

811
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,760
um you know, battling terminal illness

812
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,240
or someone who has um their own kids as

813
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,000
a single mom and took in foster kids.

814
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,159
So, you definitely want to give back to

815
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,840
them and I get to, you know, give them

816
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,360
spaces that are just as beautiful and

817
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,799
inspiring as they are and get in the

818
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,559
kitchen and cook with them. Well, you've

819
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,399
helped a lot of folks. You rearrange

820
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,159
their homes if you work in their

821
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,840
kitchens, which is a in itself a pretty

822
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,440
brave thing to do. And you've been able

823
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,600
to make some big-time changes with with

824
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,200
with simple moves. That's the part

825
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,640
that's coolest about it. You know, it's

826
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,240
when people are going through a lot and

827
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,840
they're stressed, they the last thing

828
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,559
they think about is, you know, a

829
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,240
relaxing master bedroom or a spa retreat

830
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,520
for themsel in their homes. And then we

831
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,200
just expanded into a plantbased line of

832
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,279
cleaning products. Oh, I'm proud of you

833
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,640
for that. Got lemon, lavender, rosemary,

834
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,640
which is good for memory retention. So,

835
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,159
I know you love. So, just those small

836
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,360
changes, incorporating them into

837
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,039
people's lives and making them better

838
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,039
just makes me feel good. Of all the

839
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,240
people that you've helped, who what

840
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,000
problems have you knocked out that

841
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,200
you're proud of? A family that's most

842
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,960
rewarding. You know, one that really

843
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,520
stands out is a family that had a dad

844
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,279
that lost his arm to cancer about eight

845
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,360
years ago. Mom suffered from heart

846
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,679
problems. They have two children. Mom

847
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,679
homeschools and they have a small home,

848
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,279
one big space, but they do so much in

849
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,840
it. She wants a place to homeschool, a

850
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,600
place to read, do art, you know, living

851
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,120
area. I'm like, how are we going to get

852
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,880
all this in one space? We have such

853
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,480
amazing designers and carpenters and a

854
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,640
whole team that we work with and we

855
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,000
actually got it done and it of course

856
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,200
destressed their lives and they're so

857
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,640
much happier now. Well, it's something

858
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,000
to behold. In fact, here's an example of

859
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,640
the room. We just saw a glimpse of it

860
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,720
before. This is the pre- Leila Ali

861
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,799
version, right? And let me just show the

862
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,919
audience what the room what the first

863
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,360
part of this room anyway looked like

864
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,519
right after Leila and her team were

865
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,559
done. You see the the after there. Walk

866
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,120
us through what's what's different

867
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,120
there. So I notic you you you painted

868
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,559
the back wall different. Yeah. So

869
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,080
there's different angles of that room.

870
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,840
You're not seeing the whole room. That

871
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,120
was their entryway. But we definitely

872
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,360
had to create defined spaces. So they

873
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,679
when we left they had a living area.

874
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,039
They had their music area, their reading

875
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,720
area. So they were defined

876
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,440
compartmentalized. So to have

877
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,799
organization in your home does wonders

878
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,080
for for families. So there's a couple if

879
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,000
you're up for it that I would like you

880
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,679
to help us with. Of course. Similar to

881
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,519
what kinds of cases you've had. Maybe a

882
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,120
bit more severe. You'll see why. Come on

883
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,880
over here. Oh, severe. That's a scary

884
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,000
word. We got Belinda and Eric here.

885
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,960
Okay. They're wonderful people. Hi.

886
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,240
You guys look good. How you doing? Thank

887
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,880
you. Thank you. May I

888
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,399
promise? Exactly. She asked for this.

889
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,519
Right. So, here's the thing. They come

890
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,039
here and they say when it comes to

891
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,399
making decisions about the home, they

892
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,600
just can't seem to meet in the middle

893
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,640
and they're starting to cause problems

894
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,240
in the relationship. And if you know

895
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,080
them like I do, there's not a lot of

896
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,840
middle here. You got two very strong,

897
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,919
intelligent people with with we're

898
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,120
opinionated. All right. So, Eric, you

899
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,480
you've been trying to work on this for a

900
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,880
while, right? I have. I have.

901
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,279
Absolutely. I have. Um I'm a stylist as

902
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,039
as well. So, to me, life is all things

903
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,279
beautiful. You got a white palette. You

904
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,200
got to splash in color and make it bold.

905
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,799
You know, we live in an amazing space.

906
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,279
We're going to be buying a new home very

907
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,320
soon. And um as far as I'm concerned, if

908
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,919
you move into it, I don't care if you're

909
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,519
there for six months or a year. You want

910
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,039
to know that when you walk in, it's

911
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,720
exactly what you want. It's worth your

912
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,240
working for and everything. But my

913
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,440
precious angel here. So you actually

914
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,640
look at this room behind you. One

915
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,159
second. You see that? Now that's the

916
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,000
warm-up, right? Before they've actually

917
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,679
moved, he got a little trial running. Is

918
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,960
that right, Eric? I did. All right. So

919
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,840
Linda, your honest opinion, and you

920
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,000
always are honest. What do you think

921
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,640
about Eric's work here? Okay. I like it,

922
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,240
but I think it's a bit much for where we

923
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,120
are. Uh, and also

924
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,039
color then the little picture frames and

925
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,200
something inside of the picture frame.

926
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,279
It's a bit much for me. She being

927
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,120
polite. She you do you like it? Yes or

928
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,799
no? I don't like it for where we are.

929
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,559
No. Okay. So, this is the way it

930
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,080
currently is. Yes, that's the way it it

931
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,000
currently. Right. So, how common is it,

932
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,679
before we get into the specifics, for a

933
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,440
couple to have very strong opinions,

934
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,960
both know they're right, and there's no

935
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,159
place for at least it seems like there's

936
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,600
no place where you could actually design

937
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,600
together. Well, first of all, Eric, you

938
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,880
did a really nice job, and I can see,

939
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,360
you know, that you have you both have

940
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,880
styles. Okay, I see that you both have

941
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,720
styles.

942
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,399
Thank you, Eric. She's patronizing you.

943
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,159
Yes. Yes. I appreciate that. Thank you.

944
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,760
As we know in design, there's so many

945
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,359
different styles, right? So, it doesn't

946
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,879
mean just because you don't it's not

947
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,040
your style per se. Exactly. Doesn't mean

948
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,440
it's not nice. But you both live there.

949
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,119
So you mentioned white with splash

950
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,280
splashes of color. Like if we have a

951
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,639
white canvas, we need splashes of color.

952
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,879
But there is no white here. And I

953
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,800
actually think that the design aesthetic

954
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,720
really pops more when you have a neutral

955
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,399
tone. Cuz one thing I do see is like I'm

956
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,320
like, where am I looking? Because you

957
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,000
know the the the artwork is blending

958
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,440
with the wall and the furniture and then

959
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,560
the carpet. Where does it start? Where

960
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,159
does it end? You would have more

961
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,760
contrast and then you would get what you

962
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,119
want and you would still have your

963
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,720
design. I think it would actually pop

964
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,480
more and then it'll have like a fresh

965
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,320
look. And a coat of paint is one of the

966
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,000
first things we do on the show on

967
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,480
Homemade Simple because it's such an

968
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,399
easy, inexpensive transformation and

969
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,399
it's instant. I'm buying Eric a

970
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,159
paintbrush.

971
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,760
Happy life. Happy life. I hope that's

972
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,040
helpful for you. You're trying to figure

973
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,320
it out. You just need to look what I'm

974
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,920
saying. Working with me here. I hear

975
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,920
you. I hear you. Right. Right. When we

976
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,760
come back, switching from home makeovers

977
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,040
to food makeovers was something all of

978
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,599
you are going to want to try for

979
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,599
breakfast. Stick around.

980
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,320
I love getting to talk with you on my

981
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,480
show every single day. But when the

982
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,800
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

983
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,880
is not over. I still have a lot that I

984
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,680
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

[Applause]

988
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,440
We're back with Lea Ali. Now it's time

989
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,040
to make over breakfast. The cooking has

990
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,400
always been a big part of Leila's life.

991
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,560
She's been making delicious meals for

992
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,320
her family since she was a kid. You

993
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,480
know, you were not at that young age.

994
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,920
Not at that young age. About nine, 10.

995
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,040
I've been cooking. My mom didn't cook,

996
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,480
so I got in the kitchen early and

997
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,160
learned. I like to eat. She did it

998
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,680
right. Yeah. And today she has a

999
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,040
breakfast using leftovers. That's all

1000
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,480
you need. Leftovers that will keep you

1001
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,839
full all day long. It's a quick meal

1002
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,599
that will change the way you look at

1003
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,960
breakfast for good. Eric and Blinda are

1004
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,880
back. They stopped fighting over that

1005
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,720
little room. They're about to taste the

1006
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,000
breakfast. When it When it comes to

1007
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,800
breakfast, you guys get tired of the

1008
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,240
same old thing. Yes, absolutely. Yes, we

1009
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,760
do. Yeah, we eat the same thing every

1010
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,119
morning. Mix over the the meals, not the

1011
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,560
people. That's what I say. So, all

1012
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,720
right. So, what are you making today?

1013
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,320
So, we are making breakfast pasta. Now,

1014
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,520
my kids love pasta and they don't love

1015
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,880
breakfast food. That's how I came up

1016
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,480
with this idea. My daughter's like, I

1017
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,000
want I was like, okay, how can I make

1018
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,119
this healthy? Get some eggs in it. You

1019
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,640
going to help me do this? I'm going show

1020
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:29,280
you. So, crack these eggs for me. Dr. My

1021
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,040
sue chef today. Okay. So, we're going to

1022
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,960
go ahead and just How many do you need?

1023
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,560
Just go ahead and do like two or three.

1024
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,520
It don't matter. Um, depends on what you

1025
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,640
like. So, we're going to go and put some

1026
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,960
oil in the pan. We've got some precooked

1027
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,720
pasta here. Now, everyone likes their

1028
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,240
pasta a certain way, right? We've got

1029
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,400
whole wheat. We got regular pasta,

1030
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,599
quinoa pasta, all sorts of pasta. So, if

1031
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,880
you're gluten-free, you can still do

1032
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,000
pasta. Yeah. You can pick your choice,

1033
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,520
right? But you're making whole grain

1034
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,040
today. We're using whole wheat. Yep.

1035
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,400
Okay. All right. So, you can go ahead.

1036
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,680
Um Oh my goodness. That's a lot of

1037
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
garlic. It is. We're not going to put

1038
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,240
all that in. We We like to season to

1039
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,480
taste. Season to taste. Go ahead and mix

1040
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,079
those up. So, you know, you can

1041
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,680
obviously can boil this pasta, but I

1042
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,920
like to use I always have pasta on hand.

1043
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,800
Like I said, my kids love pasta. Okay.

1044
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,800
So, we're just going to go ahead and

1045
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,920
toss those in without without spices.

1046
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,839
I'm going to put the slices in next.

1047
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,160
Yeah. There's no wrong way to do this.

1048
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,560
It really ends up in the pan. So, I have

1049
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,760
some turmeric here

1050
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,880
cuz it's just good for you. I like to

1051
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,640
just get in. Tumeric's good for your

1052
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,240
brain. Yes. And then we have the pepper,

1053
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,359
right? Yep. And then I'm going to use

1054
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,960
depending on how much do you like

1055
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,079
garlic? How you I happen to love garlic

1056
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,119
cuz I go to work usually after

1057
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,240
breakfast. Oh, yeah. So, we'll just use

1058
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,440
a little bit cuz I don't want anybody

1059
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,560
talking about you. I don't want anybody.

1060
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,280
That's a little bit. Yeah, that's a

1061
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,000
little bit. Oh, jeez. Don't worry. I got

1062
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,680
this. I got this. You want to mix it?

1063
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,720
You like you're ready. Go on and mix it

1064
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,720
up. I tell I tell I love breakfast foods

1065
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,320
that have that have dinner components to

1066
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,760
them. I like to eat what I love. So,

1067
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,960
whenever it is, just eat the foods that

1068
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,720
you like and make them as healthy as

1069
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,640
possible. And that's I used to pretty

1070
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,079
competitive. Very. That's why I took

1071
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,440
this back over cuz I saw you were taking

1072
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,240
over my dish and I was like, "Hold on,

1073
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,400
Dr. Eyes. Hold on. Come on over here,

1074
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,359
Eric. Come. Are you guys competitive?

1075
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,720
Okay, we're going to play a little game

1076
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,680
I play at my house. Grab one little

1077
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,640
strand there. And you grab one, Eric.

1078
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,320

here's the deal. All you got to do is

1081
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,599
slurp it up a You got You're short. It's

1082
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,880
a lot shorter than mine. Yes. I'm All

1083
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,839
right, let me see yours. You're the one

1084
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,119
I care about. I'm going to beat you.

1085
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,079
Yeah. No, I'm going to beat you. Are you

1086
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,400
ready? Put your mouth, guys. Sh. Three,

1087
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,400
two, one.

1088
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,469
[Applause]

1089
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,160
You lost. I lost. How did you even do

1090
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,440
that? Let the ladies out the way. Yeah.

1091
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,800
How'd you do that? God, do you have that

1092
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,560
on slow-mo? Is it weird? Did you hide

1093
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,520
it?

1094
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,440
Slow. Come over here. Oh my goodness.

1095
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,119
Seriously, I just stir up that fast. I

1096
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,800
know. You practice at home. No, I

1097
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,079
didn't. I might have cheated a little

1098
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,440
bit. I think I just kind of used my

1099
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,119
fingers, but it's okay. I just couldn't

1100
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,680
let you win. I couldn't let you win.

1101
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,880
Well, you won. You won. All right. So

1102
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,560
this is basically making a scrambled

1103
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,480
eggs with some pasta in it. Yes. So

1104
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,599
basically this is done. Okay. And what I

1105
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,040
love about this is you could add

1106
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,720
vegetables. You can add whatever you

1107
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,960
want to it. You know, make it your way.

1108
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,040
Do like a pasta bar. But I have some

1109
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,680
turkey, some meatball um that I we

1110
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,680
pre-made here. But I love to do meatball

1111
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,560
turkeys. I'm sorry, I said meatball

1112
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,560
turkey. Turkey meatball. They comes in

1113
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,280
both forms. Yes, exactly. And you put a

1114
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,280
couple in there. And these could be from

1115
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,480
last night. Yeah. And we already have um

1116
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,440
some for us to taste. So, I'm just

1117
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,119
showing you how you put this. Put a

1118
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,200
taste that see what you guys think. Very

1119
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,560
good. And here's one for you and one for

1120
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,839
me. Are the kids usually happy eating

1121
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,440
this? That's the question. They are. I

1122
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,960
wouldn't put too too don't want to put

1123
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,160
the herbs on for my kids or they would

1124
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,400
eat it. Yeah. You don't want them to see

1125
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,560
that. No, definitely not. Blend the

1126
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,000
slurper. Miss the slurper champion of

1127
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,079
the world. What do you think? This is

1128
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
delicious. Very good. Go like it. Eric,

1129
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,000
you happy?

1130
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,520
I tell you what, in my home I, you know,

1131
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,880
this is a design question. I think

1132
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,400
everyone ought to focus their lives

1133
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,760
around their kitchen, eating the right

1134
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,079
foods, but it also is where community is

1135
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,839
always happen. Oh yeah. My my kitchen is

1136
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,359
my happy place and my in my family room

1137
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,320
is right off the kitchen because then my

1138
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,280
family knows I'm going to be in the

1139
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,400
kitchen so you better want to be you

1140
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,599
want to be close to me. Well, I'll make

1141
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,680
it the first room you make over when you

1142
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:06,240
come to my house. God bless you. You can

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,400
check out by dr.com or more importantly

1144
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,800
check out Lea Ali show homemade simple.

1145
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,000
It's not owned every Saturday. Thanks

1146
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,000
Angel. Thank you. We'll be right back.

1147
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,280
Over

1148
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,320
100 young men mysteriously drowned. All

1149
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,400
deaths ruled accidental. There's GHB in

1150
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,400
in the system. Gate rape drugs, but some

1151
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,400
say it's the work on the smiley face

1152
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,079
killers. This is a big idea. The theory

1153
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,079
of there's a gang of serial killers.

1154
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,830
Next, Oz.

1155
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:42,480
That's coming up tomorrow.

1156
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:44,240
[Music]

1157
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,320
He is being called one of the most

1158
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,400
influential thought leaders of our time

1159
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,119
with nearly 100 million views on

1160
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,119
YouTube. Dr. Jordan Peterson. He sat

1161
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,280
down in my studio for a very special

1162
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,839
series of Oz talks that I'm sharing

1163
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,520
exclusively with you. He's breaking down

1164
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,119
the biggest issues we face in our

1165
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,680
society from depression and

1166
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,599
disappointment to anxiety and lack of

1167
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,760
meaning. And he's given us the tools we

1168
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,000
need to fix them with a simple click of

1169
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,400
a button. Here's just a taste of what he

1170
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,240
had to say. happiness. You talk a lot

1171
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,520
about it. Should it be our life goal?

1172
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,640
And if not, what should we be seeking?

1173
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,880
Well, it shouldn't be our life goal.

1174
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,040
Um because there are times in your life

1175
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,599
when you're not going to be happy. And

1176
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,560
then what are you going to do? Your goal

1177
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,400
is demolished. And there are going to be

1178
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,920
plenty of times in your life when you're

1179
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,319
not happy. There might be years. And so

1180
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,000
it's a shallow boat in a very rough

1181
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,800
ocean.

1182
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,560
And h and it's it's it's based upon a

1183
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,560
misconceptualization.

1184
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,280
Happiness is something that descends

1185
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,960
upon you. Everyone knows that you know

1186
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,560
it it it it comes upon you suddenly and

1187
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,440
then you should be grateful for it

1188
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,040
because there's there's plenty of

1189
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,040
suffering. And if you happen to be

1190
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,599
happy, well, wonderful. Enjoy it. Be

1191
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,880
grateful for it. and maybe try to

1192
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,200
meditate on the reasons that it

1193
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,040
manifested itself, right? Because it it

1194
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,319
can come as a mystery. You know, you

1195
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,040
don't necessarily know when you're going

1196
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,520
to be happy. Something surprising

1197
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,920
happens and

1198
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,200
delights you and you can analyze that.

1199
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,720
You can think, well, I'm doing something

1200
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,480
right. I'm in the right place right now.

1201
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,079
I've done something right. Maybe I can

1202
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,920
hang on to that. Maybe I can learn from

1203
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,480
that. You can hear more of our

1204
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,480
conversation on dr.com as well as on my

1205
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,839
podcast starting this June. Together my

1206
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,560
friends, change is happening. Our

1207
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,560
journey is just beginning.
