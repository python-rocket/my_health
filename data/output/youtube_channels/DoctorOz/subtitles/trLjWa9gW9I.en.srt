2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,799
After being diagnosed with terminal

3
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,120
cancer nearly two years ago, Valerie

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,960
Harper continues to defy all odds,

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,280
maintaining a positive and inspiring

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,679
outlook on life. In January 2013,

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,680
Valerie Harper stunned the world with

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,680
news that she was terminally ill.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,000
Doctors telling her she had only 3

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,320
months left to live.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
The actress best known for playing Roda

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,880
on TV had been diagnosed with an

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,400
incurable form of lung cancer that

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,520
spread to her brain.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,000
>> I thought, okay, I have it. How bad is

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,719
it? What's the fight game plan to fight

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,640
this? We don't have to choose negative.

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,879
You can choose positive. And that's what

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,360
I did with cancer.

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,840
Now nearly 2 years later, Valerie is

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,239
still going strong, studying her doctors

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,640
and defying the odds by tapping into

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,879
what experts call the mindbody

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,890
connection. What is it and how does it

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,310
work? Valerie Harper knows.

26
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,559
[Music]

27
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,199
[Applause]

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,640
Her spirit is truly infectious. I'm glad

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,640
to welcome Valerie Harper.

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,790
[Music]

31
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,840
[Applause]

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
Darling, it's so good to see you. Oh,

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,920
God.

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
Thank you. And I'll be careful. And I'll

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,320
be careful.

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,159
>> No falling down.

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
>> I got to say, it's a dream for me to

38
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,200
have you come on. When I heard the news,

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,680
and by the way, the diagnosis Valerie

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,759
had would give her three months to live.

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
Three months. Now, it's almost two years

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,280
later. I never thought I'd see you

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
again.

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
>> I know. Why do you think it wasn't your

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,560
time?

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,960
>> I'm not sure. I do not know. And when

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,240
someone's time is up, I guess it is. I

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,840
mean, I could walk out of here and get

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,399
hit by a bus, but the hopefully not, but

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,399
but

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
>> mob by an audience.

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,640
>> A that's so sweet. They are. They're

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
wonderful. And I I've watched you so

54
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,240
constantly.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,119
>> They're such a part of the show, Doc. I

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,360
love that. Um, I think I have a crack

57
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,239
team, an unbelievable doctors,

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,720
oncologists. Also, I'm doing acupuncture

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,160
and I'm taking herbal tea. Then I have a

60
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,160
husband who gets me out there

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
exercising. So, I'm doing all the good

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
things you should do anyway and then

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,280
taking my pills diligently.

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,400
>> Where do you find the strength when when

65
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
someone faces a bad outcome? And we in

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,520
all our lives are going to face these

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,800
kinds of conversations.

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,440
>> Where do you go for strength?

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,560
>> Well, the truth is that we're all facing

70
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,560
death. It's there. I I hate to break it

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
to you, but that's

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,040
>> right.

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,519
>> Yeah. It really just key is don't go to

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,760
the funeral till the day of the funeral,

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,040
>> honestly, because it's so wise.

76
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,599
>> It really is.

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:53,120
>> Yeah. And I I I I just have kept a open

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,800
mind and and I also recently uh realized

79
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,239
with this cancer uh diagnosis that every

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,519
moment that you spend in fear and

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,280
sometimes you have to be because you're

82
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,239
terrified and you're in pain or whatever

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,959
it is, every moment that you sit there

84
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,000
in fear, letting stress and fear take

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,080
over, you have forfeited that moment

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,760
that could be filled with joy.

87
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,239
>> Yeah. So, so why

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,760
>> I I really think it's true. So, I I've

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,640
been kind of doing that. I've been

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
trying to

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
>> I was struck by some of the comments you

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,920
made on visualization that you see

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,440
yourself kicking cancer's butt. Kicking

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,080
cancer out of your body. Right.

95
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,200
>> Exactly.

96
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,959
>> Describe what that's like.

97
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,680
>> Well, that was the other part. I didn't

98
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,080
get to it. That I I was going to Yeah,

99
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,319
imagery is very important. And it's a

100
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
actor's stock and trade. I mean, that's

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,920
what we do. We make up stuff and pretend

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,720
we're someone else. So all you have to

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,400
do is imagine and I imagine myself as

104
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,120
Tinkerbell maybe in a golden gown and um

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,879
I just say are you going to stay or are

106
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,959
you going to leave and these little

107
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,760
cancer guys are there and I say if you

108
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,959
don't I'm ridding you. So I Tinkerbell

109
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,360
or Valerie touches the little guy and he

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,480
disappears into white light. That's one

111
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,879
of my big images.

112
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,799
>> You know when I sit here next to you I I

113
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,400
don't see cancer at all. I see life.

114
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,640
Real life. Life is meant to be. I do.

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,880
>> I would love if you could share some of

116
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,000
these insights, the practical elements

117
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,759
of them with our audience. And this is

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,440
true. You could have a very bad cancer

119
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,919
of the brain that spread from your lung.

120
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,759
>> Yes.

121
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,080
>> Or it could be high blood pressure or

122
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,080
something pretty minor. But these mind

123
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,360
over matter issues. You're living proof

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
of it are important.

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,240
>> Oh, they're it's crucial, I think,

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,840
because really there are are cells. I

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,479
know there are people that say it's not.

128
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,960
It's an invader. Um, but there are cells

129
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,759
going haywire. So maybe we have more

130
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,199
power over it than we really realize. So

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,120
>> So I brought you a little I brought you

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,639
a little homework right now. I we had

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,000
Valerie do this exercise for her, but I

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,440
want you all to do this at home as well.

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Straightforward. I want you to take a

136
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,639
piece of paper and split it down the

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,639
middle. And this is from somebody. This

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,160
is not from Valerie. On one side of it,

139
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,080
you're going to think of, in this case,

140
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,400
your cancer, right? Your current health

141
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,759
battle, whatever it might be, diabetes,

142
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
you know, headaches, whatever it might

143
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,320
be. uh how you are and what that enemy

144
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
is doing to you. Draw yourself against

145
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
the battle. So I look at these images

146
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,600
and I see someone who's got some

147
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,680
negative things going on, negative

148
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
mindset. They got the cancer is this big

149
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,919
scary monster and

150
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,840
>> look at the arms.

151
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,680
>> Yeah, the arms are big and strong and

152
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,680
you're just unhappy and a victim to it.

153
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,240
And can I show you all Valerie's?

154
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,759
>> Okay, go ahead and describe this.

155
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240
>> I think it's pretty good.

156
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,320
>> Well, he's a little fable guy and he's

157
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
weak and he's doing Yeah. and he's

158
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,360
sneaking around and they and and they go

159
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,759
on tour like in show business they do

160
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,120
they want to do encors they want to have

161
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,520
a return engagement and then they go on

162
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,160
tour to other parts of your body so I

163
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,199
see him as you know kind of a sad guy

164
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,170
that isn't wanted and I'm happy I am a

165
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,320
happy person

166
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,639
[Applause]

167
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,360
>> so I asked a leading researcher yeah

168
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,080
you're winning

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,520
>> so far

170
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,960
>> I'd love to invite a leading researcher

171
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,960
in the field of integrative oncology to

172
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,680
join us please welcome Dr. Kelly Turner.

173
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,199
She's interviewed so many people

174
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,560
>> who have kept the positive attitude in

175
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,120
the face of cancer.

176
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,000
>> Oh yes.

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
>> You know, you've got a lot of

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,960
experience, maybe more than anyone else

179
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,120
in this area. Do these images surprise

180
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,560
you? From someone who's fearful and

181
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,919
losing the battle potentially to someone

182
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,639
who's upbeat and maybe winning the

183
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,800
battle.

184
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,319
>> They don't surprise me at all. I've

185
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,479
studied thousands of people who've

186
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,319
beaten the odds against cancer. And one

187
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,199
of the things that they have in common

188
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
is taking control of their health. So

189
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,919
for example, many of them are told by

190
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,080
their doctors, there's a 99% chance you

191
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,080
won't be alive in 3 months.

192
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,880
>> But the people that I study, people like

193
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
Valerie, respond by saying, I'm going to

194
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,479
be that 1%.

195
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,440
>> Val, you've uh very kindly started

196
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,840
working with the American Lung

197
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,199
Association. This is a great program.

198
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,280
>> Yeah. It's a new women's group and we

199
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,120
have to do this called Lung Force. Uh

200
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,120
give advice to all the women out there

201
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,319
who don't know much about lung disease,

202
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,560
in particular lung cancer.

203
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,199
>> Oh, you must join us. The truth is

204
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,160
there's a huge gap between how women

205
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,759
most women feel about lung cancer. It's

206
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,000
not on the top of their radar or

207
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,840
something to be a risk or anything to

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,560
worry about. Breast cancer maybe or

209
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,880
other kinds of cancer. It is the number

210
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,520
one killer cancer killer of women

211
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,319
>> and 1% of the survey said they even

212
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:27,840
think about it. So that's really bad

213
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:30,479
statistics and women don't know how big

214
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,560
a threat lung cancer is to them and to

215
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,759
men. I think it kills

216
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,599
>> also number one for men.

217
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,120
>> Num number one for for both

218
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,199
>> and many of them are non-smokers.

219
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,520
>> I'm not a smoker. I never smoked a day

220
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,759
in my life and I got the disease. Here's

221
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,319
the thing. If you have lungs, you're in

222
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,919
line for lung cancer. That's just the

223
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,680
way it is. And I don't mean for you to

224
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,160
sit in fear and go uh it's just get to

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,120
get get some kind of screening uh and it

226
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,160
it gets it I I as a doctor well knows if

227
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,479
it gets to force stage because it's well

228
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,280
it's mushy right it's not like bone

229
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,319
>> it goes on tour as you mentioned I I've

230
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,599
