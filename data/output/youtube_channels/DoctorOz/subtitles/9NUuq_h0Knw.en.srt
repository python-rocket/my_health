15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:48,160
money comes a new world order. Where a

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,840
rub it on the areas that are, you know,

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,400

fast fixes for summer as you've never

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,960
seen them before. You may never look at

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,159
a banana the same way

33
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,640

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,720
like a small amount, but today I'm going

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,159
to reveal some big ways it can help you.

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,399
It's the $1 fast fixes for summer show.

38
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,079
Let's get right to it. First, the summer

39
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
sun. I love being out here getting all

40
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,840
this. But sometimes we got problems like

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,159
Debbie over here. You have a $1 solution

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,759
for a sunburn. And here's why. Because I

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
understand you actually got a sunburn.

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,960
Yes. What happened? How could this

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,240
happen to you? I went out for one hour

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,479
to take a walk. And who knew in one hour

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,600
that I could get burned that badly? It

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,319
was just this week. Here's the picture

49
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,120
of her. And the $1 solution for the pain

50
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,520
of sunburn

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,800
is aspirin. You used aspirin, but not

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,400
the traditional way. No, we used it

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,440
topically. Uh, my daughter, her friend,

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,760
we were all burned, so we decided to try

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,080
the aspirin. I know you're a big fan for

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,360
its

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,959
anti-inflammatory capabilities. So, we

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,640
decided to see what we could do

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,160
topically. And we smashed it up, simple

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,800
as that, into a fine powder and added a

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,720
little bit of water and made a paste.

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,840
And it was as simple as that. We just

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,160
put it right on the burn. And how long

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,280
did you leave it on for? Maybe 20

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,040
minutes. Okay. Are you ready for a

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,800
before and after picture? You saw the

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,920
before. There was an ugly red burn just

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,480
a few days ago. This is 24 hours later.

69
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,760
Isn't that amazing?

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,920
I love that. What is it? I got to say my

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,360
advice is to avoid the burn in the first

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,480
place. But I know I know you want to get

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,120
some color. So I had Dalia who watches

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,920
the show post a $1 fast fix to help you

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,360
get bronze without the burn. It's a

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,560
self-tanner. You want to know how she

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,040
did it? How do you bronze without the

78
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,879
burn? You use coffee grounds. Had you

79
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,159
ever heard of that before? No, never.

80
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,800
So, she made a little video so you

81
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,760
wouldn't make any mistakes. Take a look.

82
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,480
Hi, Dr. Oz. My name is Delisa and I want

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,080
to be bronze while staying healthy. So,

84
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,959
my $1 summer fix is for self-tanner. I

85
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,680
take one cup of coffee grinds and mix it

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,200
with three to four tablespoons of olive

87
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,280
oil to make a nice thick paste. I take

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,239
the paste and rub it all over my body

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,480
and wait 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,360
it off. I towel dry and voila. Look at

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,920
the difference.

92
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,560
That is a great result. You want to try

93
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,239
it? Sure. Okay. Grab my speech chair. I

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,439
It's all yours. Get working on cuz I

95
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,360
want no more burns for you or your

96
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,360
family. Set set the right example for

97
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,280
those kids. Enjoy yourself. You'll wipe

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,080
it off later. Try it. I'm saying it'll

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,239
work. Trust me. All right. Next, let's

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,600
get to the summer lumps and bumps. Hya

101
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,959
is here with a $1 fast fix for blisters.

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,240
You want to show show it to everybody?

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,680
Yes. It is deodorant. And this with this

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,440
deodorant, if you come over here, I'll

105
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,680
show you real quick. You pop your

106
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,120
sneaker off. You find your trouble

107
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,800
spot and you just put the deodorant in

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,479
your shoe. You do the shoe and the foot

109
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,759
or just the shoe? Just the shoe. And

110
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,560
that's going to prevent the friction

111
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,080
between the shoe and the foot. And that

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
will stop the blistering. And you can do

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,639
it on the toes, on the heel, wherever

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,840
your severe blistering spots are. And

115
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,520
why do I have to put it on the shoe and

116
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,720
not on the sock or my foot itself? It

117
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,400
needs to have the stability so it can

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,759
prevent the friction. Not on the sock.

119
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,440
On the sock. Do it right on the sock.

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,720
Yes. You got to put it on your foot. I

121
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,800
like your authoritative approach to

122
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,080
this. It's good. All right. And and you

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,080
you apply it every time you put the shoe

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,680
on. Um you only should have to do it

125
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,960
maybe once or twice. And even for people

126
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
who wear heels, you know, you're having

127
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,880
that hot night out and you suddenly Oh,

128
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,320
my foot. Just get a little bit of

129
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,560
deodorant, stick it on the back of your

130
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,840
heel, dance all night. I like that hot

131
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,440
night hot move you were giving me.

132
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,600
That's good. All right. Thank you very

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,080
much. Appreciate Dalia. Next story is

134
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,240
here. She's a $1 fast fix for vetting

135
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,280
bug bites. Yes. What do you get for bug

136
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,120
bites?

137
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,479
Dr. Oz, I'm a holistic health coach, so

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm always looking for ways to avoid

139
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,160
chemicals, right? Lucky for us, bugs do

140
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,000
not like the smell of lime and cloves.

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
Oo. So, this is much cheaper than buying

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
a citronanella candle. Obviously, much

143
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,080
safer. Your children and your pets won't

144
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,280
be injured if they um touch lime and

145
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,520
cloves, smell it, smells like Christmas

146
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,960
in July, right? That's really strong.

147
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
You can put that with that uh deodorant

148
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,759
over there. You know, people know you're

149
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
coming by. I know. So, you can place

150
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,960
these around your deck in the yard. You

151
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
can even have your children help you

152
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,320
create these. A fun little project. They

153
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,680
can be your centerpiece. Yeah. What ever

154
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,680
gave you the idea of trying this? I

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,800
actually learned this in school. In

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,000
school? Yeah. So smart. Congratulations.

157
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,880
Thank you very much. I love it. Kathy's

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,680
got a $1 fast fix for razor burn. Very

159
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,400
common this time of year. Yes. I have

160
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,240
spent probably most of my adult life

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,440
looking for a solution for those red

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,840
bumps that you get. So, um, my solution

163
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,840
is the cucumber and milk and I mix it

164
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,919
into a froth that I apply actually more

165
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,400
in almost like a shaving cream and I use

166
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,880
it as I shave and then I also apply it

167
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,759
topically afterward for about 10 minutes

168
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,080
and I have no bumps and no burn like I

169
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,680
used to in the past. It's just locked in

170
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,440
there. Yes, it smells good. It does. You

171
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,600
just put a thin little layer on. I do.

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,479
It actually it it applies really nicely

173
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,720
and it it softens your skin. So, it's

174
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,280
it's a great fix. And is this store in

175
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,880
this pretty well? It it stores well. I

176
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,080
like this. These are all wonderful tips.

177
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
I appreciate it very much. Thank you.

178
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,360
All right. Now, we're going to move on

179
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,880
to the barbecue area. My favorite part

180
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,880
of summer. Same as a $1 fix for a

181
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,720
healthy kebab. I love kebabs. You know,

182
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Turks, they eat kebabs all the time.

183
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,120
Yeah. Yeah. Barbecue. Pure with metal

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,960
and everything. Yeah. Or the wood. Or

185
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,400
the wood. That's good, too. But we have

186
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,599
a new one. You do? Rosemary. Rosemary.

187
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Yes. Yes. Oh my goodness. Rosemary.

188
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,120
What? Why rosemary? Because it has so

189
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,840
much more flavor than just metal or any

190
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,520
wood. And then it's very affordable. You

191
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,039
guys don't have to spend as much. Show

192
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,240
me how you do it over there. Okay. Plus,

193
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,680
if I bite into it, I won't break my

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,319
teeth, which is sort of nice. Right.

195
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
Exactly. So, you want to get a nice

196
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,039
thick strong stick and then you can fill

197
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,440
it with all of

198
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,120
your [ __ ] right? So, you can fill it

199
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,160
with all your favorites. I see there's a

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,759
lot of vegetables up here. You're a

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
doctor, but I personally I would want

202
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,840
like a lot of meat, you know, give me

203
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,840
some chickens. Well, compromise, right?

204
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
Chickens, right? You screw the whole

205
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,840
chicken with this thing. Yeah. Pieces of

206
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,639
chicken. Yeah. Some beef up there.

207
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,560
That's great. So, yeah. Basically, yep.

208
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,080
You want a nice thick stick and you just

209
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
you might want to sharpen the edge a

210
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
little bit. These are pretty sharp. How

211
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,840
much you going to do with them if

212
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,520
they're any sharper than that? I mean,

213
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
it's not put an eye out with these

214
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,440
things. This Yeah, but you know, I think

215
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,960
the taste will be really cool with with

216
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,800
the sage as well. Yes. It gives it so

217
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,800
much more flavor. It's wonderful idea.

218
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,879
Thank you very much.

219
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,720
And that's you got a $1 fast fix for

220
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,879
cleaning your grill. May I show it to

221
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,319
everybody? Yeah. This I got to say I I I

222
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,639
heard about this. I did not think it was

223
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,720
possible, but I just demoed it and this

224
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,519
is really cool. Amazing. It is simple,

225
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,200
quick, and healthy. So, I from

226
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,519
California, we grill all the time.

227
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,440
Backyard barbecues, we barbecue at the

228
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,159
park. And you know, who likes dirty

229
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,320
grills? And cleaning up the dirty grill

230
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,920
afterwards. It's It's so long and it

231
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,760
takes a long time and it's so hard. But

232
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,000
I have a simple solution. So, you can

233
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,920
just grab an onion and all you do is cut

234
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,279
the onion in half and you lay it flat on

235
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,480
the grill and you just scrub it

236
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,040
down. Just scrub it all the way. Now,

237
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,040
look at this, guys. This is so

238
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,640
cool. cow. And then look at that. It

239
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,120
comes right off. Wow. Isn't that

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,880
something else? Yeah. That's a good use

241
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,320
of an onion. Enjoy California with All

242
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,839
right. And a bonus $1 fast fix. This

243
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,080
dates back to the times in ancient

244
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,760
Egypt. They used to use this to treat

245
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,680
sore throats. It was a marshmallow

246
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,560
plant. How many of you seen marshmallows

247
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,200
growing on

248
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,240
plants? One person in the back. So, you

249
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,680
know, that's what a marshmallow plant

250
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,959
looks like, that little picture. But

251
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,320
it's not to say marshmallows obviously,

252
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,160
but the marshmallows that you recognize

253
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,519
and that I love that you usually grill

254
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,279
all the time for dessert, you can

255
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,760
actually use marshmallows to soothe an

256
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,959
itchy, sore throat from summer allergies

257
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,560
works differently than the ancient

258
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,399
Egyptians version, but it still works.

259
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,080
Today's marshmallows work because they

260
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,480
have gelatin in them. The gelatin may

261
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,760
coat your throat, which can relieve any

262
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,800
of that pain in the back of your throat.

263
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,279
Just don't overdo it, obviously, because

264
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,240
you'll be wearing these on your hips

265
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,920
otherwise. I love getting these fast

266
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,200
fixes from you. They work so well and we

267
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,279
love spreading them around. So send me

268
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,880

269
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,970

What's your favorite and effective home

275
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,959
remedy? Whenever my children have a sore

276
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,040
throat, I make them gargle with salt

277
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,440
water for 1 minute and then drink a big

278
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,519
mug of hot tea with honey. It works

279
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,240
every time. Share yours on

jump start a healthy lifestyle. Don't

326
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
nutritionist Carrie Glman is here to

327
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,680
walk us through this forever slim down

328
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,440
plan. So, why is summertime the perfect

329
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
time to jump start a healthy lifestyle?

330
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,440
It's perfect because the sun starts to

331
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,360
shine and the tank tops come out, the

332
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,279
bathing suits come out, and people think

333
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,040
crash diet. Well, we know that leads to

334
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,279
yo-yo dieting, and that's not a good

335
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,480
thing. I like to think of summer as the

336
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,800
perfect time to not crash diet for, but

337
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,720
implement the behaviors that will be

338
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,560
long-term and long lasting for

339
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,920
sustainable weight loss. Remember,

340
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,519
stuff's cheaper that's good for you,

341
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,880
like fruits and vegetables, and you also

342
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,480
have the motivation, those tank tops and

343
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,680
other bikini like items to look better.

344
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,360
All right? And the sunshine and you want

345
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,079
to exercise more, right? Let's go over

346
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,680
to talk about it being a VP. VP means

347
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,600
volume produce. You want to fill up on

348
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,680
all this stuff. Summer produce again,

349
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
it's high in flavor. It's the best

350
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,560
nutrient content you're going to get all

351
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
year long. What are the stars of the

352
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,800
program? Okay, so I love veggies

353
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,600
because, as you just said, high in

354
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,160
volume, water volume, fiber volume. I

355
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,800
love veggies. Like we've got zucchini

356
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,839
and cucumbers and lettucees and onions

357
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,360
and tomatoes and peppers. All of these

358
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,800
veggies are going to fill you up, keep

359
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,079
you fuller longer because again, when

360
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,240
you're enjoying the sun, you don't want

361
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,680
to feel hangry. That's right. And so,

362
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,920
one of my favorite ways to fill up is

363
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,760
with a salad or a soup before the meal.

364
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,800
Soup actually will help you eat less

365
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,839
calories at the overall meal altogether.

366
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,920
So, something like a spacho loaded with

367
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,680
vegetables and again that liquid volume

368
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,440
there will help fill you up. You've got

369
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,519
also the benefit of the fiber in there

370
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,200
and the antioxidants will als which will

371
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,040
also help protect your skin from the

372
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,720
sun. Little little bonus there. A little

373
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,639
kick in it. And it's got a kick which

374
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,320
also by the way the spiciness which

375
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,600
we'll also find in this corn salsa over

376
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,680
here actually also helps to satisfy you

377
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,000
when something spicy that alone can help

378
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,399
reduce your appetite. So this corn salsa

379
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,040
I also love cuz first of all corn is in

380
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,959
season. Delicious. Again, all the

381
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,800
vegetables for the uh water and the

382
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,600
fiber volume. And again, so much better

383
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,360
than those creamy fatty dips that you

384
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,240
see at BBQs. Well, I love both these.

385
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,920
We're going to put the recipes up on

386
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,680
dr.com if it's okay, so you can all make

387
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,519
them yourself. Now, I want to talk about

388
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,600
the next big item. I want you to eat in

389
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
threes to balance that carb cravings.

390
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
It's an important step. I'm going to

391
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,000
show you. I have a little seesaw I built

392
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,240
for you. I want you to remember this.

393
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,680
When we eat carbs alone, like a Danish,

394
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,199
for example, they initially spike up

395
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,720
your energy, but then when the blood

396
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,800
sugar comes back down, you have nothing

397
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
left behind. It wears off quickly. You

398
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,079
have to eat a lot more carbs. You not

399
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,839
just one dish, but three more. And all

400
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,279
those continue sort of weigh down on

401
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,240
you. Not only do you gain weight, but

402
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,320
you don't have the energy because

403
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,000
there's no lasting power to the carbs.

404
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
But when you choose the right carbs and

405
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,760
you pair them with healthy fats and

406
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,680
protein, your seessaw of life, your

407
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,920
energy, it balances out. Stable blood

408
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,440
sugar, stable energy, and guess what? It

409
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,320
makes it much easier to burn off any fat

410
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
because you're going to feel like

411
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,920
exercising. So, you want to eat in a

412
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,959
balanced way like this. I think if we do

413
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,839
this the right way, it makes it

414
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,680
enjoyable. So, we sent a recipe to Jill

415
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,920
from the experts at the Canyon Ranch,

416
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,199
and here's what she made for us. Now,

417
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,199
you're just your regular audience

418
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,120
member. No formal training. No formal

419
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,880
training. You just took the basic expert

420
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,880
nutritional advice. And what have you

421
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,720
made for us? So, Dr. Oz, when I got this

422
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,519
recipe, I was so excited to find out it

423
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,680
was oatmeal. My family and I love. It's

424
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,920
oatmeal. Oh, it is. Yes, it is. But it's

425
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,000
better than just regular oatmeal. So,

426
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,839
this recipe you actually make the night

427
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,920
before. I don't know about you, but the

428
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,160
mornings are crazy. in my house. So,

429
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,800
it's fabulous to be able to just get

430
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,760
something to go. So, it's basically

431
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,040
Oops. You make the recipe with rolled

432
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,560
oats, Greek yogurt, milk, and chia seed.

433
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,760
You put it in the container, you put the

434
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,760
lid, you put it in the refrigerator

435
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,680
overnight. Next morning, you stir it,

436
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,360
mix in berries, flaked coconut, nuts,

437
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,240
whatever is your preference, and you're

438
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,079
ready to go. I love that. Fabulous. I

439
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,240
love that. It's perfect. It's a perfect

440
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,000
balance. You're getting the carbs from

441
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
the oats and the berries. You're getting

442
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,040
the protein from the yogurt and then

443
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,279
you're also getting the healthy fat from

444
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,880
the coconut and the seeds. Delicious.

445
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,560
Perfect balance. Long lasting energy.

446
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,839
And it was so yummy. I made a couple. I

447
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,560
actually had one last night for dinner,

448
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
too. Perfect. Eating in threes works.

449
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,600
Thank you very much for sharing with us.

450
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,160
Thank you. All right. Appreciate it.

451
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,839
Next on the

452
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,519
tip idea has to do with a different way

453
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,000
of thinking about dessert. I want you

454
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,360
thinking about a fruit as dessert. What

455
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
you make for us, Carrie? Okay, here's

456
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,240
the thing. If you're going to fire up

457
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,920
the grill, you might as well get use out

458
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,040
of it right through dessert. And we know

459
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,800
that all those chocolate chip cookies

460
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,360
are not really or pies are not the best

461
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,720
thing at a barbecue. So, I love grilling

462
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,680
fruit. So, here we're going to throw in

463
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,040
some lime juice. We've got some honey

464
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,240
here. You can whisk away. You told me

465
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
you're a good whisker. So, I I've

466
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,560
high cinnamon. Whisk away there. And

467
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,680
then we can just brush on the pineapple.

468
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,440
Show the wrist. You know, Carrie, it's

469
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,519
an excellent job. Look at that. Look at

470
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,519
that whisking. About everyone can whisk

471
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,000
like that. Amazing. And then we're just

472
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,600
going to brush on right here onto the

473
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
pineapple. Just like that. I like to use

474
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,079
the whisk for that. And then perfect,

475
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,959
perfect, perfect. Excellent job. And

476
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,079
then right over here, already already on

477
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,679
the grill, we have the pineapple. And

478
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,400
all you need to do is grill it about 3

479
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,240
to 5 minutes on each side. Absolutely

480
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,079
delicious. I mean, actually, when I was

481
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,439
looking at this before, I was thinking

482
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,120
that this could almost be the main

483
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,120
course instead of the burger. It looks

484
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,319
so satisfying. Let's Let's Let's cut

485
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,919
that baby up and see what we got. Let's

486
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,559
do this. Here. I'm going to cut this up

487
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,480
for you. I'm a sloppy barbecue guy, but

488
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,520

tomorrow on Dr. Oz.

548
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,880
We just found out what to eat to slim

549
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,720
down for summer, but if you want to get

550
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,120
back into your shorts, you got to move.

551
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,080
So, fitness guru Richishi Masusa is back

552
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,600
with his thigh and booty blast. So, why

553
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,799
do you sing out the thigh? The legs and

554
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,240
the thigh area. Why is that so

555
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,720
important? It's all about the booty

556
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,720
right now. The booty is in. I mean, pop

557
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,160
stars are singing songs about the booty.

558
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,000
They're doing music videos about the

559
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,080
booty. Everyone's posting pictures of

560
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,320
themselves on Facebook and Instagram

561
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,520
showing off their fabulous booties. I

562
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,440
mean, seriously, who doesn't want to

563
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,919
turn to the side, look at themselves in

564
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,240
the mirror, and think, bam. Right now,

565
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,400
that would hurt. To get that pain, I

566
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,320
hurt. You got to work those glutes. You

567
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,000
got to work those outer thighs, the

568
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,520
inner thighs, and the quadriceps. All

569
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
right, so we want some ladies who want

570
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,780
very attractive thighs and tushes, too.

571
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,400
Come on out, ladies.

572
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,720
[Applause]

573
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,240
That hurt me. Ow.

574
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
That hurt. All right, take it away,

575
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,919
Richie. We want to do squats with the

576
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,440
booty bounce. Okay, so we're going to do

577
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,039
squats with the booty bounce. So, we're

578
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,880
going to put our feet about a shoulder

579
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,400
width apart. Now, we're going to make

580
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,799
pretend we're sitting down in a seat.

581
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Sit down. Now, come up and tighten that

582
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,240
booty and down. And booty. Now, this is

583
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,600
working the quads and this is working

584
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,039
the glutes and down. Now, we're going to

585
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,240
add some flavor. We're going to spice it

586
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,799
up. You're going to go down. Now, you're

587
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,360
going to lift that leg back and down.

588
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,960
We're adding spice. And backice and

589
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,919
down. And back. And down. And back. Now

590
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,200
we're going to come down. We're going to

591
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:11,760
hold it. Time for the booty bounce. And

592
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:15,120
one, two, three. Booty bounce. Five,

593
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,200
six, seven. Up on eight. And repeat. And

594
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,600
down. Two. You feeling that burn,

595
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,840
ladies? How often you do this? You're

596
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,159
going to do these every other day. And

597
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,080
up. I mean, Benny's two season's right

598
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,080
around the corner. So you got to work

599
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,919
hard now. No time to waste so you look

600
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,039
fierce in your swimsuit. All right, side

601
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,640
series. So now we're going to do the

602
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,960
side series. You're going to lay on your

603
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,720
side. And now you're going to bring your

604
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,720
legs into a tabletop. You're going to

605
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,400
reach that top leg straight out. And

606
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,159
you're going to flex that foot. Now

607
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,159
you're going to lift that leg up and

608
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,840
down. We're working the outside leg, the

609
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,760
abductors or the abductors. And lift up.

610
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,400
And lift up. And hold. And little

611
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,760
pulses. Up. Up. Oh, it's uncomfortable.

612
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,280
Yeah, that's right. Burn, baby, burn.

613
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,880
And now we're going to stack the knees

614
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,120
on top of each other. We're going to go

615
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,480
to a dog and a fire hydrant. We lift

616
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,520
that whole leg up. Now lift the whole

617
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,520
leg up. Don't pee on your leg. And down.

618
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:12,080
And up. And down. And up. And now up.

619
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,559
And hold. And little circles. Ah.

620
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,240
Circle. Circle. That's right. Oh my

621
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,799
goodness. And circle the other way

622
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,280
around. This is uncomfortable. Did you

623
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,600
guys expect this? All right. Now cross

624
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,600
that top leg on top. Reach that bottom

625
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,159
leg down. Flex that foot. Now you're

626
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,880
going to lift that bottom leg up and

627
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:34,559
down and up and down. This is for your

628
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,440
inner thigh July. Up and down. It

629
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,640
doesn't move and

630
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:44,240
leg and little pulses. It doesn't

631
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:47,440
move. Now we move up. Up and hold. You

632
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,720
got to be kidding. You got it. And relax

633
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,880
down. Oh my goodness. That's good. So,

634
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,760
now we got one more exercise to do. You

635
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,840
good, ladies? We're going to do donkey

636
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,200
kicks. You're going to bring your hands

637
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,200
right underneath your shoulders. Now, if

638
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,600
anyone has any wrist problems, you can

639
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,440
modify this by going on your forearms.

640
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,919
Okay? So, now we're going to reach that

641
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,320
right leg back. You're going to bend the

642
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,720
knee, flex the foot, so you're in a 90°

643
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,480
angle. And now, you're going to pulse up

644
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,440
and up. Now, this is what's going to

645
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,039
give you that bam look, ladies. And hold

646
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,919
it up again. And up. up. This is working

647
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,960
those glutes. Now hold it. Booty bonus

648
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,799
up an inch. Oh god. And relax down.

649
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,559
Child pose. We got to go right to the

650
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:35,200
other side. Now lift the other leg up.

651
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,960
And you're going to reach up. Up. Now

652
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,720
how long yours is so I get my booty to

653
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,559
be like yours. Well, it's got to be in

654
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,640
shape for the summer. So you got to work

655
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,799
now. And you got to do both sides. We

656
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,440
don't want to see any lopsided booty

657
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:51,679
judies out there. So you got to lift up

658
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,480
and hold. Booty bonus of an engage and

659
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,280
relax down. Now you guys got to do these

660
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,440
exercises. If you commit to them, you'll

661
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,520
be the one posting those pictures, those

662
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,919
bootylicious pictures on Facebook and

663
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,760
Instagram. It doesn't hurt anymore. Look

664
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:09,760
at that. Right. Take us to stretch as we

665
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,600
stretch. All that booty work. We got to

666
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,919
do a stretch. So lay back down on your

667
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,880
back. You're going to do the figure four

668
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,559
stretch. You put your f your your your

669
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,240
ankle over the thigh. You're going to

670
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,600
reach that right hand through the hole

671
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,080
and you're going to grab onto the back

672
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,799
of the leg and get that nice stretch. It

673
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,559
feels so good. I like this. And now

674
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,760
switch it to the other side, guys.

675
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,080
Listen, while we're doing this, you can

676
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,279

679
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,840
What do you use to measure your fitness

680
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,679
progress other than your weight? It's

681
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,279
not a metric, but I can always tell how

682
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,799
I'm doing by how I feel while I'm

683
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,400
running. If I still feel good after

684
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,240
three miles, that's how I know that I'm

685
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,520
doing a good job on my fitness routine.

Then on Thursday, she went from PTA mom

707
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
to the heroin addict next door. I knew

708
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,520
through my high school kids who was

709
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,039
dealing it. He showed me how to smoke

710
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,880
heroin for the first time. Are

711
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,120
overprescribing doctors the root of

712
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,960
addiction. That hopelessness of knowing

713
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,799
you're going to die and in such a dark

714
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,320
place when you do. The nationwide

715
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,000
problem that's finally getting

716
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,000
attention. What was your rock bottom?

717
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,120
When did you realize that a PTA mom had

718
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,080
become a junkie?

719
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,080
That's coming up on

720
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,020
[Music]

721
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,559
Thursday. Hipped inside this box is the

722
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,919
one food almost 90% of you aren't

723
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,240
getting enough of. To give you an idea

724
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,760
what that means, that's this entire part

725
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,279
of the audience. Only you folks are

726
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,880
getting enough of this stuff. Just a

727
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,480
little bit of us are getting it. It's an

728
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,400
ingredient that will not only help you

729
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,000
lose weight, but may protect you against

730
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:43,120
heart disease and colon cancer. And it

731
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,360
is pretty simply stated, fiber. All the

732
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,760
foods that have fiber. So, today I have

733
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,200
a fiber fix for every woman because many

734
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,320
of you need it. Mary is joining us. How

735
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,640
are you,

736
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,720
Mary? So, look at all this all this

737
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,480
fiber that we're missing in our lives.

738
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,679
And a lot of people don't think about

739
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,279
fiber too much. When they do think of

740
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,200
it, it's not a good story. So, what

741
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,400
comes to your mind? I think of those

742
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,320
bland, tasteless fiber bars, like

743
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,799
cardboard. Yes. Why would anyone eat

744
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,919
that? I don't know. I don't like them.

745
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,960
But, you know, fiber is so much more

746
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,840
than that. And that's why we're here

747
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
today. We're going to talk a little bit

748
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,720
about it. Come on over here. I'm going

749
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,520
to play a little game with you. I put up

750
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,600
pictures here, foods that a lot of us

751
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,960
like. Some of us, some of us may know,

752
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,240
they sort of look healthy. Which of

753
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,919
these foods do you think has a lot of

754
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,919
fiber? Pick three that you think is are

755
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,480
rich in fiber. Um, broccoli.

756
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,840
Broccoli. Apples. Apples. Raspberries.

757
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,720
And raspberries. Well, what do you

758
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,039
think? Pretty

759
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:42,159
accurate. That's a very mixed response.

760
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,080
It was actually a trick. They all have a

761
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,919
lot of fiber. Every one of these things,

762
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,520
the oranges, the peas, the beans, they

763
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,880
all have broccoli, you happens to have a

764
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,640
bunch, but raspberries have even more.

765
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,400
Pears, big rich source. Nuts, all of

766
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,080
them. The question then becomes, how

767
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,760
much do you need? And why aren't we

768
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,440
putting this into our diet? So, I want

769
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,640
to change your mind about fiber. I

770
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,240
brought an expert in nutritionist and

771
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,799
author of the healthy mind cookbook.

772
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,799
Rebecca Catz is here. Hi, Rebecca. Hi,

773
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,080
Mary. Nice to meet you. So, why do you

774
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,640
think people aren't getting enough

775
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,039
fiber? I think people have a real

776
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,039
misconception about fiber. I think

777
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,840
people think it tastes like cardboard,

778
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,760
wood chips. Yes. Right. But some of

779
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,080
those words we used earlier today. Yes.

780
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,159
And I think you know fiber is like

781
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,760
little the food that has contains fiber.

782
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,279
It's like little vacuum cleaners.

783
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,360
They're going to make you regular, make

784
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,120
you feel good, make you feel satiated.

785
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,000
How much do we need for a woman? Well,

786
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,720
we need about 25 grams and we're

787
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,480
probably getting somewhere around 14.

788
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,919
All right, let's move on here. Rebecca

789
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,679
says they're quick fixes. We have to get

790
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,360
those again. 25 grams of fiber. You're

791
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,960
only halfway there roughly. This is

792
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,440
something that I really like a lot. This

793
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,200
is pistachio nuts. I don't know if you

794
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,480
eat them very often. I like pistachios.

795
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,720
Explain why pistachio nuts are a

796
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,640
favorite of yours. Well, they're like

797
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,520
eating. They're like the butternut.

798
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,799
They're incredibly satiating. So, you

799
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,279
could make a basil pistachio pesto. You

800
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,760
could make a kale pesto. You could just

801
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,840
carry them around in a little bag and

802
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,360
just munch on them. And a quarter of a

803
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,360
cup has got about four grams of fiber.

804
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,039
So, you're on your way with these little

805
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,240
tasty bites of yum. It's pretty good.

806
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,399
So, if you look at these things, they

807
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,919
have three times more fiber than, for

808
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,559
example, cashews, which I happen to also

809
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,559
like a lot. And if you just eat once one

810
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,840
ounce of them a day, it's 50 pistachios.

811
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,960
You can spend a lot of time opening 50

812
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,080
little things up. So you won't eat too

813
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,760
many of them, which is good news as

814
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,279
well. So it's a fantastic way of dealing

815
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,480
with a snack or you get the fiber you

816
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,080
needed. You can put a little garlic or

817
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,159
chili pepper on them, spice them up a

818
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,080
little bit. Customize them to what you

819
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,240
like. But I'll tell you what, pistachios

820
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,799
don't taste like cardboard to me. No,

821
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,440
not at all. Right. Second big uh fix for

822
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,559
fiber is avocado. And avocado is sort of

823
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,840
interesting food because a lot of folks

824
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,000
don't eat that many of them. Are you a

825
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,799
fan of avocados? I'll have it on a salad

826
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,399
or a sandwich or guacamole. Does Does it

827
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,399
taste like cardboard to you? Not at all.

828
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,760
I like avocado. Thank you. Audience,

829
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,919
question for y'all. Just real clear on

830
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,000
this. Is are avocados fruits or are they

831
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,320
vegetables?

832
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,720
Why are they fruits?

833
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,960
Oh, the smartest audience television.

834
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,159
It's a fruit because they have pits.

835
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,200
They are fruits. So, so it's one of

836
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,159
those fruits you can have, but it

837
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,600
doesn't, you know, there's not a lot of

838
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,960
sugar in them. What do you Why do you

839
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,399
like these so much? Again, these are so

840
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,039
satiating. I mean, oh, it's like again,

841
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,679
it it's just like little magic carpets

842
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,360
going back and forth on the taste buds.

843
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,320
So, you know, you can put them on

844
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,480
sandwiches, you can make a guacamole,

845
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,159
you can make an avocado cream and use it

846
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,520
instead of mayo. And one avocado has got

847
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:40,159
10 grams of fiber. Okay, the last one is

848
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,000
a controversial fiber fix. It's Brussels

849
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,559
sprouts. So, what is it about Brussels

850
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,399
sprouts that give them a bad rap? Well,

851
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:51,120
you know, as a chef, I can tell you that

852
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,039
in the old days growing up, I think we

853
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,279
all

854
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:58,000
experienced boiled Brussels sprouts that

855
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:01,520
were kind of stinky and they look like a

856
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,399
Seattle drizzle. But really, the best

857
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,720
way to cook a Brussels sprout is to

858
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,880
roast it. So you toss it with a little

859
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,279
olive oil, a little maple syrup, a

860
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,200
little dijon mustard, put it on a sheet

861
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:18,720
pan, roast it for 15 minutes, and one

862
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,480
cup of Brussels sprouts roasted, which

863
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,440
are like nice and sweet and a little

864
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,919
crispy. That's about three grams of

865
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,279
fiber. They're great for irregularity

866
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,200
for everybody out there. The one catch

867
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,960
on these is they sometimes cause a

868
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,200
little gas. Does that ever happen to

869
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,120
you, Mary? I avoid them for that reason.

870
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,360
You is that right? Oh, that's Look, gas

871
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,799
is a natural process. Everyone in this

872
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,760
room has already passed gas once. You

873
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,440
probably have too since we've been doing

874
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,039
the show. Get your Brussels sprouts in.

875
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,240
You can find 50 more fiber fixes on

876
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,240

880
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,640
What's your favorite fiber richch food?

881
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,240
I've loved prunes for years, and now

882
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,080
that I know they're packed with fiber, I

883
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,519
love them even more. I make sure that my

884
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,840
kids eat some throughout the week as

885
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,279
well. They really like the taste. Share

886
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,799
yours on

887
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:10,799
facebook.com/dos. Coming up next, she

888
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,200
found strength and courage to not become

889
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,000
a statistic and found inspiration while

890
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,320
in a jail cell. A visual power to change

891
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,159
her destiny. The inspiring woman

892
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,840
teaching you how to make your dreams a

893
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,640
reality. Coming up next, the anti-aging

894
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,279
plan to look and feel like a 10.

895
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,519
Tomorrow on Dr. Oz, we're tackling the

896
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,399
biggest signs of aging from the inside

897
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,279
out. fine lines, wrinkles, dull

898
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,399
complexion, and thinning hair. Plus, the

899
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,480
total 10 just got easier. Dr. Oz has the

900
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,559
shopping list of everything you need.

901
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,120
Stock up on the fundamentals. It's the

902
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,680
next step in dropping those pounds.

903
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,220
That's coming up tomorrow on Dr.

904
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:55,960
[Music]

905
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:59,120
[Applause]

906
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,120
Oz. If you ask Lucinda Cross how she

907
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,720
found the inspiration, strength, and

908
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,880
courage to fulfill her dreams, she'll

909
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,960
tell you without any shame or drama.

910
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,440
Inspiration came to her in a jail cell.

911
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,240
It's all about going from vision to

912
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,320
manifestation. Lucinda Cross has always

913
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,720
been a go-getter. If you give me that

914
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,960
one talent, I won't turn back. If you

915
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,600
show me what that one talent is, I

916
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,120
promise I won't disappoint you.

917
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,039
She's an internationally known

918
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,080
motivational speaker and best-selling

919
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,120
author. But long before her success, she

920
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,399
admits to making a big

921
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,440
mistake. One that stopped her life cold.

922
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,440
I was young going to college, freshman,

923
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,600
made some poor choices, struggling

924
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,600
financially, and it landed me in big

925
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,919
trouble.

926
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,960
Lucinda was caught transporting drugs

927
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,519
for a Nigerian drug cartel. She spent 5

928
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,200
years in a federal prison inside. No one

929
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,200
talks about dreams and goals and

930
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,360
visions. There's no aspirations. There's

931
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,360
no hope and there's no programs for

932
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,159
empowerment.

933
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,880
So Lucinda used what she had, glue,

934
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,280
pictures, and paper. In prison, she

935
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,599
created her first vision board, a tool

936
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,839
to help visualize her goals and achieve

937
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,440
the things she desired. I had a fear of

938
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,520
being judged. I had a fear of being

939
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,839
rejected. I had a fear of being looked

940
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,079
down upon. And so I cut out pictures of

941
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,320
people in audiences cheering with their

942
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,320
hands up. So I imagined that they were

943
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,800
cheering for me. Another vision board

944
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,879
while in prison, getting an education. I

945
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,879
knew I needed my degree. I knew I needed

946
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,879
higher education. That vision came true.

947
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,280
After leaving prison, she went back to

948
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,599
school and got that degree. And that

949
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,320
inspired Lucinda to create more vision

950
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,679
boards to reconnect with her family, get

951
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,919
a job, and find true love. I wanted that

952
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,440
man, that night and shining armor. And I

953
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,240
started to see the things that I put on

954
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,159
my vision board come to

955
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,000
fruition. My goals, my aspirations, it

956
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,839
started to come to life. To pay it

957
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,320
forward and to show others the power of

958
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,960
vision boards, Lucinda regularly hosts

959
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,520
vision board parties. She also created

960
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,680
Activate, a leadership organization to

961
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,079
encourage women to activate the power

962
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,720
within. You got to pump yourself up to

963
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,119
get in the ring of life every single

964
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,079
day. Cut out the vision. Cut out the

965
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,079
images. Cut out the life that you desire

966
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,560
and you'll be living it before you know

967
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,200
it.

968
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,040
Send the cross is here. What a crazy

969
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,440
story. How difficult is it to have

970
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,440
dreams when you're in jail? It's

971
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,880
extremely difficult. No one talks about

972
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,720
what you can achieve when you're

973
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,200
released. They only focus on what did

974
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,960
you do to get there. And many people,

975
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,760
even myself, you feel like your name is

976
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,599
tarnished and you just want to give up.

977
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,800
You didn't want to be a statistic, which

978
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,400
I can completely understand because

979
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,240
that's how many folks, whether they're

980
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,440
in jail or not, feel. How did you use

981
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,119
these vision boards to change that? I

982
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,040
used the vision boards to just get me

983
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,720
focused. I used the vision boards. They

984
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,320
the boards taught me that what you focus

985
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,560
on, you become. And you know, I'm

986
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,240
becoming something great. It's sort of

987
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,359
like the law of attraction, which I know

988
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,560
a lot of folks have talked about in

989
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,839
different ways, but if you select

990
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,520
positive pictures and words, you're

991
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,200
going to be able to and begin to

992
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,640
manifest those things into your life.

993
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,240
So, listen brought two of our vision

994
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,520
boards with her today. Come on over. I

995
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,520
want you to walk us through these.

996
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,440
Explain how these work for you. There

997
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,240
sort of examples what folks can do at

998
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,480
home. Absolutely. So, it's more than

999
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,960
just cutting and pasting. So, one of my

1000
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,920
vision boards is my 2015 goals. And

1001
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,920
that's the far one over there. That's

1002
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,640
the far one over there. my goals and and

1003
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,040
I put words and put them as a focal

1004
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,960
point so that I can focus on them as if

1005
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,800
I've already accomplished them. Got it.

1006
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,640
And then there's my professional board

1007
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,720
which I'm extremely excited about

1008
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,880
because I made a bold move and I put my

1009
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:51,200
face on the cover of Essence Magaz Oh my

1010
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,960
goodness. That's pretty cool. Yeah.

1011
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,839
Just to show you this in this vision

1012
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,920
became a reality. This is an issue of

1013
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,119
Essence magazine from this year. There

1014
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,640
she is. just where she put

1015
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,320
herself. So, let me ask you the the

1016
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,599
tough question. I mean, anyone can, as

1017
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,200
you say, cut and paste, put pictures

1018
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,520
together, they can paste their face on

1019
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,520
top of of a model on a magazine cover.

1020
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,680
How do you take that vision board and

1021
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,440
make it into reality? So, just to be

1022
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,520
clear, it's more than just cutting and

1023
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,839
pasting and creating this pretty

1024
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,680
collage. You have to take action. You

1025
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,119
have to believe in yourself. And you

1026
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,800
just have to know that, you know, the

1027
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,040
things that you focus on can come to

1028
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,599
fruition. Um, and I go through something

1029
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,560
called the five Fs, you know, faith,

1030
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,320
family, friends, finance, and fitness.

1031
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,640
And making sure that health is number

1032
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,400
one because without health, Yeah. is

1033
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,359
nothing. It's a good life vision board.

1034
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,599
I love it very much. You've inspired

1035
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,960
many people that you don't even know to

1036
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,960
reach their dreams. We've got people

1037
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,800
writing to us wanting to thank you for

1038
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,280
that. How does it make you feel? Oh my

1039
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,800
gosh, it feels amazing. It does. It

1040
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,880
feels amazing to know that you're

1041
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,640
working in your life's work. You're

1042
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,560
fulfilling your calling. You're doing

1043
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,839
what you were called to do and at least

1044
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,359
changing a small portion of your world.

1045
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,800
I love when people have been to hell and

1046
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,320
have come back and tell the story of

1047
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,150
success. God bless you, Linda. Thank you

1048
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,839
very much. We'll be right back.

1049
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:16,000

1050
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:18,400
Whoever said a doctor's visit isn't fun

1051
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,800

Oz. Next Wednesday on Dr. Oz. I go to

1073
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,079
bed late and I wake up early. I really

1074
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,920
need something to get me going. Sound

1075
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,880

1079
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,400
It's actually kind of fun. A plan to

1080
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,560
keep you going all day long. I stand on

1081
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,890
my feet for 9 hours a day. It just gives

1082
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,359
me that extra push. That's coming up on

1083
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:41,280

1084
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:45,040
Wednesday. The anti-aging plan to look

1085

and feel like a 10. Tomorrow on Dr.

1086
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,920
We're tackling the biggest signs of

1087
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,400
aging from the inside out. Fine lines,

1088
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,280
wrinkles, dull complexion, and thinning

1089
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,920
hair. Plus, the Total 10 just got

1090
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,079
easier. Dr. Oz has the shopping list of

1091
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,000
everything you need. Stock up on the

1092
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,640
fundamentals. It's the next step in

1093
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,510
dropping those pounds. That's coming up

1094
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:13,599
tomorrow on Dr. Oz.

1095
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:15,839
[Music]

1096
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,920
This is not hocus pocus. Researchers

1097
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,079
have found there's a medieval concoction

1098
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,920
that may actually help cure the MRSA

1099
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,520
superbug. The recipe, which dates back

1100
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,599
from the 10th century, calls for, listen

1101
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,680
carefully, garlic. That's the book it's

1102
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,760
in, by the way. The garlic. Put the

1103
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,079
garlic in there. Minced up a little bit.

1104
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,720
A little bit of onions. Imagine making

1105
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,760
this thousand years ago. Some leaks.

1106
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,200
That's all pretty normal. You could do

1107
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,280
that at home right now. Then they add

1108
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,560
the wine. They had to have wine. They

1109
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,320
didn't have water that was clean, so

1110
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,000
they always used alcoholic beverages for

1111
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,760
that purpose. But here's the part that

1112
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,040
might be hard to find these days. This,

1113
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:53,040
my friends, is is bile. It smells like

1114
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,599
bile. Bile from the stomach of a cow.

1115
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,200
I didn't make this thing up. There it

1116
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,880
goes. Right. Put the whole thing in

1117
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,119
there. And all you got to do is mix it

1118
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,520
up. And then this mixture, you brew it

1119
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,960
in a brass vessel, purify it through a

1120
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,200
strainer, and you got to let it sit for

1121
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,920
nine days. It sounds ridiculous, doesn't

1122
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,599
it? Scientists found that this potion

1123
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,920
kills 999 of a thousand of these MRSA

1124
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,280
bacterial cells in mice. They have no

1125
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,400
idea why it works, but a thousand years

1126
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,000
ago, they made this thing up and it

1127
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,920
still works today. So, I'm intrigued by

1128
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,880
it. Now, it's time for in case you

1129
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,079
missed it. First up, we talked about

1130
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,599
dollars. The dollar sounds doesn't sound

1131
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,440
like a lot of money, but you'd be

1132
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,880
surprised at how far it can go for you.

1133
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,800
Summer's almost here and many of you are

1134
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,440
probably opening up your grill for the

1135
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,720
first time in months and probably need

1136
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,280
some cleaning. So, instead of buying

1137
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,280
expensive cleaners, today's $1 fast fix

1138
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,000
is to use an onion. Cut the onion in

1139
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,200
half like this. And then rub it like

1140
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,359
that. You got to heat up the grill a

1141
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,040
little bit first. Don't burn your hands.

1142
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,960
And watch what happens. That, my

1143
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,480
friends, is pretty cool. You can get

1144
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,000
your grill clean. Everyone's happy. You

1145
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,680
haven't spent any money. Next, if you

1146
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,200
want to slim down for the summer and fit

1147
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,359
back into those summer shorts, you got

1148
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,040
to move. Got two wonderful victims here

1149
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,440
today. You You know the moves today?

1150
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,280
Okay. So, we're going to do this is a a

1151
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,480
thigh booty blasting move. If you do

1152
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,000
both of them together, you can do it

1153
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,200
anywhere you want. It starts with squat.

1154
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,560
Everyone stand up for a second here. You

1155
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,720
guys can do this part. It's so easy to

1156
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,800
do. So, you know how to do a squat. So,

1157
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,640
three squats down. Remember, your knees

1158
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,960
don't go in front of your knees. One,

1159
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,480
two, knees right on top of the toes. And

1160
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,240
then three. And here's where it gets

1161
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,920
hard. Bounce up and put your left leg

1162
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,079
straight back. You guys can't do that so

1163
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,880
easily. Oh, stop complaining and whining

1164
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,640
up there in the top row. Other leg down.

1165
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,240
The other leg again. One more time. And

1166
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,560
then back to the right leg. And then you

1167
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,560
end it with the booty bounce. Ready? Go

1168
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,160
down. Boom. And just keep bouncing right

1169
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,359
out the commercial. I'll see you guys

1170
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,359
next time. I like your booty.
