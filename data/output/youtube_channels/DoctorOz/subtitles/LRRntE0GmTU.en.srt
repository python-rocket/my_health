00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,360
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,440
Thinning hair and hair loss is the

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,520
medical condition I hear about the most

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,240
from women. And when it starts to thin

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,400
and fall out, panic sets in and it can

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
take an emotional toll. That's what

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,640
Shawn is going through. I know a lot of

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,039
you can relate.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,400
My name is Shawn, 35 years old. I feel

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,080
so much older because I'm losing my

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,920
hair. I have incredibly thin

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,640
parts. I have bald patches in the back.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,200
No matter where I part that part, I have

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
the hair

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,760
horizon. 10 years ago or so, I had much

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,239
thicker hair. Um, I felt more confident

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,320
going out with my friends. When I look

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,440
in the mirror, I see more scalp every

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,079
time. When I brush my hair, I see clumps

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,879
of my hair. I freak out quite a bit. I

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,960
wonder how I am going to cover these

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,360
bald spots in the back of my head. For a

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,600
living, I am a pub trivia host. Welcome

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,600
to team trivia. So, I'm in front of a

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,960
lot of people at a time. I'm gonna go

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,240
ahead and play a song. I do feel more

27
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,040
confident when I'm wearing a hat. When

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,280
I'm hiding my hair inside, I do feel

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,360
very insecure. If I take off my hat

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,479
while I'm there, are they going to think

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,040
I'm sick? Are they going to think

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,119
something's wrong with

33
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:23,360
me? This is my buffet of hair loss

34
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:26,720
camouflage. I have 50 some odd baseball

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,720
caps. I would never really go out

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,600
without a hat or something to cover my

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,960
hair up

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,000
with. From start to finish, it takes me

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,840
a good 45 minutes to style my hair in

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,400
the morning. This is my collection of

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,439
volumizing shampoos, conditioners, dry

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,320
shampoos. Pretty much anything you can

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,880
put in your hair, I've put in my hair.

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,360
I wonder a lot what I've done that's

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,280
caused my hair to fall out so early in

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,880
my life. I can't even make the hat work

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,200
on my head right now. Um, kind of want

48
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,719
to

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,520
cry. It really hurts me emotionally to

50
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,440
see my hair just falling out.

51
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,080
Thanks for being here, Sean. So, how

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,560
does a hair loss affect you emotionally?

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,680
My mom had this gorgeous, thick, full of

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,280
hair. Um, oh, I'm sorry. I'm already

55
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,800
crying. Um, I lost her in 1997. Sorry.

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,200
So now every time I see these clumps of

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,000
hair, I've got these bald patches and

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm like, it's just another way. I'm

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,319
disconnected. I'm disconnected from her.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,920
Um, to the point where I won't go out

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,480
with my friends without wearing a hat. I

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,319
won't be in

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,519
pictures. What kind of person doesn't

64
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,120
want to be in pictures with their

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,440
friends? What kind of person goes out

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,319
and says, "You know what? I have to hide

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,599
myself from here instead of being out

68
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,480
there and being in it with all my

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,760
friends. Does it make you feel helpless?

70
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,200
I feel like there's nothing I can do

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
anymore. I've put so many different

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,760
things in my hair. I'm ready to give up.

73
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,879
I'm just ready to give up. I want to go

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,560
home and cry and never leave my house

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,760
ever.

76
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,519
I don't want any of those things to be

77
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,599
true for you. I'm going to change all

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,120
that today. Okay. I've got to start by

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,200
put you in the truth tube because I want

80
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
to show you some numbers. Okay. I don't

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,360
want you to see this as a fearful

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,959
experience. I want you to see this

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,640
uplifting because it's going to give you

84
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,920
control back. Okay? What we fear most

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,040
really is what we don't understand.

86
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Okay? So, I'm going to give you that

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,800
today. Let's take care of it. Come out

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,400
here. I did a battery of tests. Okay?

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,159
Stand right there. That way you'll be

90
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,599
able to see your numbers. So, let me

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,560
first give you the good news. Okay?

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,080
These are the numbers that we checked

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,239
that actually I was surprised were were

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,480
so good. You're not anemic. Okay? You're

95
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,480
not low on iron. Okay? You're not low on

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,200
selenium. Okay? These are the the things

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,239
we look for first. Okay? But there were

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,360
some numbers that weren't good. Okay.

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,440
And if it's okay, I'm going to share

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
those with you. Let's do it. All right.

101
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
So, the first thing we looked at were

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,280
your hormone levels, which really should

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
be the first place you look with hair

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,239
issues. Okay? And they were abnormal,

105
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,239
significantly abnormal, and they point

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,239
to problems with your thyroid. Okay?

107
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,680
It's not working well. Second thing we

108
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,360
looked at was the amount of inflammation

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
in your body. Okay? Your inflammation

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,239
numbers were again very, very high.

111
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,879
Okay? Your glucose. All right? you know,

112
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
it's a sign of diabetes or pre-diabetes.

113
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,239
Okay, your numbers were not in the

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,319
diabetes range, but they weren't normal

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,799
either. So, we put you sort of in the

116
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,479
pre-diabetes range. Okay, again, an area

117
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,799
where I think we can make improvement.

118
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,759
We can work with that. And finally, I'm

119
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,160
going to point out something that

120
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,560
everyone right now can start addressing

121
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,880
and you will also, which vitamin D, and

122
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,560
your levels were low. Okay, they weren't

123
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,240
just low, they were really low. In fact,

124
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,720
you want your your vitamin D level to be

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,400
at least 30. That's like the minimum 30.

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,400
Okay. Your number was one of the lowest

127
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,400
we've had on the show. It was 13.

128
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,400
I don't even know how to process that.

129
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
Well, let me put it in this way because

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm going to go through these numbers

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,000
with you very slowly and very carefully.

132
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,800
But you came here for answers today.

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Yeah. I just gave you a bunch of answers

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
and I have no idea how to process them.

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
No. I'm going to I'm going to walk

136
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,680
That's why you're here. That's why

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
everyone's here because you're not

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
alone. Okay. I'm going to take you

139
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,440
through this and you're going to feel

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,600
when you're done that all these are

141
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,919
addressable. Every single one of them.

142
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
Hair loss is a fixable problem if you

143
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,919
know what to aim at. So, what we're

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,919
going to do today is get you involved

145
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,360
with a program that's going to allow you

146
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,880
one by one to change those numbers. I

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,560
don't want you running into muticians or

148
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,400
more hair products anymore. I want you

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
running into doctors. That's a message

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,360
for all of us. Would you hear me with

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,639
that? Let's do it. All right. I've got

152
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
this right person to induce you to.

153
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,120
We're going to go through the whole

154
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,560
thing. how to deal with inflammation and

155
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,160
get everyone confident that we can work

156
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
to grow our hair back. When we come

157
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,680
back, a plan for everybody struggling

158
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,280
with thinning hair and hair loss. Stay

159
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,240
here. Today, we have the plan to reverse

160
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,320
hair loss and regrow your hair. Sean is

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
only 35, but she has developed bald

162
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,840
spots and her hair comes out in large

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
clumps. So, I wanted to find a doctor

164
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,520
that work not just on treating hair loss

165
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,039
issues, but the underlying medical

166
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,639
imbalances that cause it. That's really

167
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,479
why you're here to see this as a symptom

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
of a bigger issue. Dr. Elizabeth Boowm

169
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
is joining us. She's a functional

170
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,880
medicine physician who works with Dr.

171
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,000
Mark Heyman at the Ultra Wellness

172
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,120
Center. So, we just saw Dr. that Sean

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,120
has some, you know, significant

174
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
imbalances. We went through her hormone

175
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,120
levels, her inflammation numbers, her

176
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,960
glucose, vitamin D. These all sort of

177
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,639
fit together. How common is it for women

178
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,479
who have hair loss? Almost half the

179
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,880
population to have one or more of these

180
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,479
problems. You know, it's so common. I

181
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,240
see this all the time in my practice.

182
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,600
And you know, Sean, as a woman, I really

183
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
relate to you because I know how

184
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,319
important the way my hair looks means to

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,400
how I feel about myself. And and women

186
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,319
come in all the time to my practice

187
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,400
saying, "I'm losing hair. What can I

188
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,160
do?" And and this is really important

189
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,319
that you came and had this blood work

190
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
done because we found so many things we

191
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,440
can work on that's going to help your

192
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,880
hair look better. Okay. Walk me through

193
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,479
the thyroid. So, what what should Sean

194
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,639
be doing? Yeah. You know, I think Sean,

195
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,120
we've got to start there because we saw

196
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,960
some major imbalances in your thyroid.

197
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,759
many things we can do in terms of diet

198
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,160
and lifestyle for the thyroid, but your

199
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,360
TSH was a little out of range. So much

200
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,120
out of range that I think we want to

201
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,199
also add in some medication to help your

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,520
thyroid. Okay. Simple to take, very safe

203
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,720
to take, not expensive to take. Okay.

204
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,919
Second big issue was the amount of

205
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
inflammation in the blood sugar. You

206
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,639
mentioned those as well. These sort of

207
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,120
middle two items. What do we do there?

208
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,120
Absolutely. So, you know, we know food

209
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,680
is medicine, right? And we're always

210
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,319
thinking about a low glycemic diet to

211
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,160
help with diabetes and to help with our

212
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,479
blood sugar balance and to help prevent

213
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,880
heart disease. But what we often don't

214
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,120
realize is that when we manage our blood

215
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,360
sugar and go on a low glycemic diet that

216
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,680
we're going to talk about, then all of

217
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,479
our hormones in our b body rebalance

218
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,039
themselves and then our we get hair

219
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,479
regrowth. Okay. And if we work to with a

220
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,440
good diet, we can get that under better

221
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,960
balance. What you're talking about with

222
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,639
the low glycemic diet for hair loss.

223
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,039
Okay. Got a little demonstration here.

224
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,800
Go ahead. The first thing we want to do,

225
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,080
I guess, is change what the foods that

226
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,840
they're that we're putting in our body.

227
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,919
Absolutely. We've got to work to lower

228
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,560
inflammation in the body because

229
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,080
inflammation comes with a with a

230
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
specific diet. And we saw your

231
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,319
inflammatory markers were kind of high

232
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
or definitely high. And so, we've got to

233
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
work to lower that inflammation. Okay.

234
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,039
So, the first thing is we're going to be

235
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,280
taking out foods that are high in

236
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,199
inflammation. The simple noodles. The

237
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,840
simple carbs. Yeah. The ones you like. I

238
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,199
know. I love noodles. Well, do you love

239
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,879
your hair more than noodles is the

240
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,400
question. I definitely want more hair

241
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,560
than noodles. We can deal with that. The

242
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,240
sugar and alcohol. Okay. They're simp

243
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,319
they're simple carbohydrates, too. They

244
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,599
get they spike that blood sugar up.

245
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,400
We're going to pull those out of the

246
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,680
diet. Dairy is an inflammatory food for

247
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,599
a lot of people. So, we're going to pull

248
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,039
that out. Okay. Okay. We're going to

249
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,279
rebuild you with foods that actually

250
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,880
help the hair. They include fiber.

251
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,440
Absolutely. All of these things. So,

252
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,599
yeah. you know, so we can we can help

253
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,919
with balancing your blood sugar by

254
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,640
giving you the right foods. So, a diet

255
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,480
that's high in fiber. Okay. Okay. In

256
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,480
addition, we want to give you good

257
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
healthy fats, things like that are found

258
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,320
in salmon and avocado. They're good for

259
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
our hair. And the other thing that fat

260
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,959
and protein does is it slows the

261
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,959
digestion and absorption of your food.

262
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,880
So, you want to have some protein and

263
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,800
fat at every meal. So, your blood sugar

264
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,880
doesn't increase as quickly with your

265
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,880
food. So, it's really important to

266
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
balance your protein, your fats, and

267
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,959
your high fiber foods each meal of your

268
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,240
day. Okay. Okay. So, except for the

269
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,839
noodles, the rest seems pretty easy for

270
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,040
you. Yeah, we can deal with that. Next

271
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,279
thing you want to do is increase your

272
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,360
daily dose of two important vitamins.

273
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,320
Okay. One is biotin. Okay. Which is the

274
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
building block for your hair and the

275
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
other one is vitamin D that I mentioned

276
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,160
over there. Okay. So, please walk us

277
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,080
through how these vitamins are important

278
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,399
for hair growth. Absolutely. So, biotin

279
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,720
is really the hair vitamin. It's great

280
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,600
for building strong hair. And you know,

281
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,080
you can get enough biotin with two eggs

282
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,440
a day. And in addition, these eggs are

283
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,959
going to help also with balancing your

284
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,440
blood sugar. So, they're a great thing

285
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,120
to add in. I can do eggs. Yeah. And

286
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,279
vitamin D. Again, you could get it from

287
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,240
the sun. But in America, we just don't

288
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,760
do that, especially in the winter

289
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800
months. You're going to take 1,000 units

290
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,240
of vitamin D. We're going to start with

291
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,519
that. There's a pretty good chance we

292
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,200
might need a little bit more. Okay.

293
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,360
Okay. And the last big issue, and I have

294
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
no idea why we don't do this more with

295
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,640
so many people suffering from hair loss,

296
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,080
is minoxidil drops daily. Dr. Bow, why

297
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,519
is this forgotten and why is it so

298
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,440
valuable? Well, you know, it's over the

299
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,760
counter. It's easy to use. You can apply

300
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
it to your hair couple times a day and

301
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,519
it helps right at the hair follicle with

302
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,600
hair regrowth. So, while we're looking

303
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,200
to get to these underlying root issues

304
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,519
with the hair loss, while we're working

305
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,360
to rebalance things in your body, we can

306
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,519
be using the minoxidil and that can that

307
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,880
can be really helpful. Okay. Yeah, we

308
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,120
can do that. Sean, we gave you some

309
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,480
answers today. Yes. Dr. Bow has agreed

310
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,440
kindly to make you her patient.

311
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,440
So, she's going to help you.

312
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,560
Thank you so much. Oh,

313
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,760
and all I want to know is now that you

314
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,200
have a bit more of an understanding and

315
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,800
hopefully a little less helpless in this

316
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,160
approach, do you still feel like hiding?

317
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,079
It's going to take a little bit to get

318
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,240
there so I can like start throwing out

319
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,360
those baseball

320
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,519
caps. But I actually kind of feel good

321
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,120
about this. I I feel pretty good about

322
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,560
this. All right, so we're going to

323
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,320
follow your story. We'll be with you.
