calorie water. Just how natural are the

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,200
natural flavors inside? And are these

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,920
hidden additives causing you to gain

weight? What's in your flavored water?

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,240

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,520
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

I love you, Becca.

[Music]

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,960
Over the last 10 years, we've been

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,960
investigating artificial sweeteners and

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,600
weight gain. And you as the smartest

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,360
audience in television switch from sodas

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
and diet sodas to drinking more of these

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
clear flavored waters. They look so

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,640
pure. But could what's in them actually

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,799
be crashing your

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,960
diet? Today the truth about no calorie

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,520
flavored waters. Are the additives in

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,520
them making you gain weight? Plus the

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,000
biggest food mystery out there. What are

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,080
the natural flavors inside these drinks?

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,520
Now no calorie flavored waters. You know

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
these you've heard of them all right?

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,000
They come in all kinds of flavors.

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,920
There's lemon, there's limes, there's

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,920
mangoes. From carbonated distilled

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,240
versions. And we spend more than $2

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,360
billion on these drinks a year. That's

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,759
what we spent last year. So, who who

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,920
here is obsessed with these no calorie

39
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,000
flavored beverages? Well, you got some

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,799
hands up here. Why do you like them so

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,040
much? They taste good. I hate water.

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,200
Yeah, it's boring, isn't it? Yeah, that

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,520
one makes me feel good, too. Who thinks

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,759
water's

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,119
boring? Enough

46
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,439
people. You What do you love about them?

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,320
Yeah. So, I used to drink a lot of diet

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,479
soda. Like, diet soda was my crutch. So,

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
I decided to try flavored water thinking

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,399
it was a better alternative, not

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
knowing, you know, how unhealthy it

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,360
could possibly be. Is anyone here

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,520
worried about the issue of the flavor?

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,280
How do they make this thing taste like

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560
passion fruit? I mean, without any

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
calories, because if I eat the passion

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,480
fruit, there'd be calories in it. Well,

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
I love water. So, I decided, let me try

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,760
some flavored water. My favorite is

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
watermelon flavored water. But I'm

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,879
thinking, how is watermelon flavored

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,640
water actually have zero calories? How

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,160
is that? That should be dawning on all

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
of us as a major concern cuz when it's

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
too good to be true, it often is. To

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,720
help me investigate these drinks,

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,640
Kellyanne Patruchi, that's a present for

68
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,160
you. And these drinks are zero calories,

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,480
but that doesn't mean they have zero

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,720
effect on your health. No, it doesn't.

71
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,200
Just because it says zero calories does

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
not give you a free pass. Now, I know

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,640
that we're using a lot of these drinks

74
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,040
and and consuming them because they're

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,280
healthier than some of the alternatives.

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,519
And in some cases, they are. But here's

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,400
what we have to watch for. There's a lot

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,840
of hidden additives in these. So, it's a

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
way of getting things in your diet that

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
you don't want and you don't even know

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,800
it. So, we have to be careful and watch

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,920
this. You all with me on this? As

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
anxious as you might be, as we're

84
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,599
learning about this, my med team and

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Kellyanne scoured the market, analyzed

86
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,720
the no calorie flavored waters out

87
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,560
there. One of the surprising ingredients

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,920
we uncovered were artificial sweeteners.

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,840
Some of them were the same ones you find

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,360
in diet soda, which is the exact

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,360
opposite of why people are switching to

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
these. You know, the med team and I

93
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
expected to find things like aspartame,

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,599
maybe a little little of that. But what

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,760
we were blown away to find is there's

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,840
artificial sweeteners all over these

97
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,760
drinks. And that's just like, you know,

98
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,680
drinking diet soda or anything else that

99
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
we're really trying to switch to

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,040
healthier options. So, they're all

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
created equal. I like the move in

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,879
general, but artificial sweeteners like

103
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,040
sucralose, right, are hot topics in the

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
world of nutrition. And we ought to know

105
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,680
about this before we make our choices.

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,799
And if we don't like what we're hearing,

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,400
buy something else that doesn't have

108
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,680
that in there. So, what's the deal with

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,120
sucralose and weight gain and these

110
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,879
other artificial sweeteners? Yeah. So,

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
this is a really interesting and

112
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,799
evolving topic because you'd think,

113
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,799
okay, zero calories, we know it's going

114
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,519
to show a correlation to weight loss,

115
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,439
but not all the studies do. Some of them

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
show a correlation actually to weight

117
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,000
gain. And we have to think about this

118
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,239
really intelligently. And here's how.

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,480
Our bodies are really smart. It's very

120
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,799
hard to outsmart the body. So if we're

121
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,199
getting this intense hit of sweetness

122
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,600
and no calories to back it up, that

123
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,199
confuses the brain and it confuses the

124
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
body. And that's never a good thing. Let

125
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,320
me a little animation to see how this

126
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,520
plays out. Thank you very much. Y in

127
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,960
real life, this is what ends up

128
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,720
happening. All right. You're sitting

129
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,560
there, you're enjoying yourself and

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,160
normally, right, you see something

131
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,680
that's got sugar in it, right? Like for

132
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,040
example, the chocolates you love or the

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
donut you enjoy in the morning and your

134
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
brain knows when you've had enough of

135
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,479
this real sugar, right? And it shuts off

136
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,080
your sweet tooth. That's how it's

137
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,680
supposed to work. But when you consume

138
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,759
drinks with artificial sweeteners in

139
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520
them, your brain doesn't seem to get the

140
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,199
right signal that you've had enough of

141
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,880
the sugar you want. Right? Your tongue

142
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,479
tastes the sweetness, but your brain

143
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
knows better. It's too smart. It knows

144
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,440
and can sense that it's a different

145
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,440
feeling, right? It's not the same

146
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,880
satiety that it gets with real sugar.

147
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
So, it sends you out there looking,

148
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,360
forging for more of these sweets, high

149
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,759
and low, and soon you're surrounded by

150
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
them. So, we love to test things out

151
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,960
here on the show. So, we did our own

152
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,639
little social experiment I think you'll

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,160
enjoy, right? Could the artificial

154
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,240
sweeteners in these drinks actually be

155
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,880
increasing your cravings? That was the

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,560
question. So, for two days, right, this

157
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,520
little social experiment on no calorie

158
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,199
flavored waters was conducted. And for

159
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,720
the first two days, we asked people to

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,720
drink plain water and they just added

161
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,880
their own lemon, right? simple, easy,

162
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
and pretty inexpensive. The following

163
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,639
two days, we asked them to drink a

164
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,000
nocalorie lemon flavored water like you

165
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,919
might go out and buy in a store, right?

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,440
Each day, they rated their cravings on a

167
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,199
scale from one to five, right? Five

168
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,039
being the most intense cravings and one,

169
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
I don't even care anymore, right? So, we

170
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,800
want to see if the number stayed low or

171
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,639
high with these two options. So, let's

172
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
bring in Alexis. How are you, Alexis?

173
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,199
Hi. You were one of our experimentes.

174
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,639
Yes.

175
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,400
So, you did you did it the way we asked

176
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,720
you to do it for four days. Okay. Are

177
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
you curious about this? Very right here

178
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,759
are the results. Again, we're just

179
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,880
looking to see whether we're getting a

180
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,240
good deal for this move. First off, when

181
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,360
people in the first two days just had

182
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,960
water with lemon, their craving

183
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,720
intensity, remember one means I don't

184
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,440
care. Five is I got to have something

185
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,280
was a two. All right. For the second two

186
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,199
days, when you switched to a lemon

187
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,479
flavored water, your craving intensity

188
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,080
went up to

189
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,080
3.5. Went all the way up to a number

190
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
that's much more concerning to me

191
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,960
because you probably were experiencing

192
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
more cravings. I don't know. Did did you

193
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,400
did you sense this in your own life?

194
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,199
100%. When I was doing just the water

195
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,680
with uh pure actual lemon, it was like

196
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,280
very satisfying the flavor itself. I

197
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,800
found myself not snacking as much,

198
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,639
sticking to, you know, three meals a

199
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,120
day. And then as soon as I went over and

200
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,400
did the like the lemon flavored water, I

201
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,479
was snacking everywhere. I was ravenous.

202
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,039
I was looking for sweet and salty and

203
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,960
all that different stuff. And in my own

204
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,560
personal life, I found this as well. And

205
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,080
you know, lemon water is an old

206
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,759
treatment in ayurveetic medicine,

207
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,520
thousands of years old. This is not

208
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,960
thousands of years old. And I'm not

209
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,000
against all these. I think there's some

210
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,759
probably reasonable products out there,

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,520
and I know it's convenient. But there's

212
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,039
one other little thing I got to get to.

213
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,560
When you do look at the ingredients, you

214
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,759
see carbonated water and then this

215
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,720
thing, natural

216
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,160
flavors. What does that mean to you,

217
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,440
Alexis? Well, I hope that it means that

218
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,800
everything in it is derived naturally.

219
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,400
We're going to find out cuz up next, the

220
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,120
biggest food mystery lighting up the

221
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,800
internet. What's in your flavored water

222
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,890
that makes it taste like a lemon or a

223
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,040
lime? Stick

224
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,040
[Applause]

225
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,720
[Music]

226
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,400
[Applause]

227
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,720
around. Eye drops. They seem harmless

228
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,120
enough, but did one woman use them as

229
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,280
the ultimate murder weapon? You won't

230
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,160
believe your eyes. A true crime

231
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,880
investigation. All new

232
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,880
Oz. That's coming up tomorrow.

233
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,039
We've been investigating the truth about

234
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
the no calorie flavored waters that are

235
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,319
all over the place. Now, no matter if

236
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,479
it's grapefruit or raspberry or lemon or

237
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,639
lime, you won't find fruit on the

238
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,199
ingredient label. But what you will find

239
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,440
is a mystery ingredient, natural

240
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,680
flavors. Now, I along with everyone else

241
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
online was curious to know what that

242
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,680
mean. So, we asked a food scientist to

243
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,120
uncover the science behind natural

244
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,800
flavors. But first, I've got some

245
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,639
audience members here. Come on in, guys.

246
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
I want them to talk about their favorite

247
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
lowc calorie waters. So, Melody, what do

248
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
you enjoy drinking? Grapefruit.

249
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
Absolutely. Isn't this cool? And

250
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,720
Shannon, what do you enjoy? My favorite

251
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,640
is passion fruit. So, grapefruit and

252
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,719
passion fruit. Right. Now, these have

253
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,919
calories in them. Right. So, Shannon, do

254
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,599
you ever wonder how this beautiful

255
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,519
passion fruit gets into that passion

256
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,360
fruit no calorie water without any

257
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,959
calories getting in there? I do. I

258
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
always think about that and I'm always

259
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,800
wondering what's the healthier options,

260
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,800
what's the more natural alternative. So,

261
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,160
I'm interested to find out. Yeah, I

262
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,440
always figure if you just squirt a

263
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,200
little bit in there, you might get five

264
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,200
calories. That's at least you know what

265
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,720
you're dealing with. But having this

266
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,080
pre-made for you with zero calories is

267
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
attractive. So, pay attention. You'll

268
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,200
enjoy this. Food scientists Taylor

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,800
Wallace and nutritionist Kelly and

270
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
Patruchi are here to tell us what they

271
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,880
uncovered about natural flavors. And

272
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,480
remember, these nocalorie drinks aren't

273
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,160
using fruit juice, right? There's no

274
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
fruit juice in the ingredients label.

275
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,680
So, how do they get the taste there? So,

276
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,399
when they say natural flavors, they

277
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,720
actually do come from a natural source,

278
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,279
but it's a process and it begins in a

279
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,080
lab. And so, here's what happens. The

280
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,320
food scientists will take a natural food

281
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,680
like this fruit, and they'll put it in a

282
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,839
big machine, and I have to tell you,

283
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,480
it's called a still, and this is a big

284
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,480
whopper, a huge machine. They'll put it

285
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,000
at a certain temperature, prescribed

286
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,640
temperature for a certain period of

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,920
time. And at the end of that, it comes

288
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,720
out like you see here. And this end

289
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,839
product is actually really concentrated

290
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,160
and all of the nutri all the nutrition

291
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,240
has been stripped away. So you can

292
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
clearly feel that this is probably not

293
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,880
going to taste good at this point. So

294
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,600
what they do is they add in some extra

295
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,320
flavor, maybe some, you know, herb or a

296
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,560
bark or another fruit essence. They add

297
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,200
that in here so you get the taste you

298
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,959
want. So the point being, if you are

299
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
drinking some kind of drink that's

300
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,040
supposed to be grapefruit flavored, it

301
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,040
may not actually come from a grapefruit.

302
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,640
Not fully. Not fully. Tell you

303
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,519
experimented with some of these natural

304
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,640
flavors in your food science lab. So

305
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,240
show them what you uncovered here. And

306
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,760
this is a pretty concrete example of how

307
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
this would be done in the laboratory.

308
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,839
Absolutely. So most companies aren't

309
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,360
going to tell you exactly what's in

310
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,240
their natural flavor because they have

311
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,640
their own recipes. So I took a flashback

312
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,720
to graduate school, Dr. draws and I put

313
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,040
on my food chemistry hat, went into the

314
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,240
lab and made us a couple of examples.

315
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,160
Now, the goal here is to really make the

316
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,839
flavors pop in your mouth, right? We

317
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,079
want to give you that experience of

318
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,720
biting into the orange, but we don't do

319
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,160
that with just one flavor. So, the first

320
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,800
drink that I'm going to show you, you

321
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,959
can take a sip, uh, just has that one

322
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,279
orange flavor in it. And as you'll see,

323
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,839
it's very subtle, right? I mean, the

324
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,279
word blend comes to mind, right? It's

325
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,959
like water with someone dripped a couple

326
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,440
droplets of orange juice in there.

327
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,000
Exactly. So, for the second drink, what

328
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,240
I did is I extracted some flavors from

329
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,079
the orange peel, the oils that are

330
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
naturally in the orange, and then I

331
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,600
added a little bit of phosphoric acid to

332
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,120
give it a little tang and really kick

333
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
those flavors up a notch. This is

334
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
fantastic. Yeah. Right. Really, really

335
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
good. See, you you invite me and

336
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,040
Kellyanne to your Christmas party and

337
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,600
I'll bring the eggnog. I'll bring the

338
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,120
alcohol. But but but so so back to the

339
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,519
issue about these natural flavors and

340
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,959
why it's this grabag term. Is it purely

341
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,800
because it's a secret recipe that they

342
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,560
don't publish it? Well, so there's a

343
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,320
number of reasons why we don't label it

344
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,079
on the food label. One, as food

345
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,240
scientists, we want to keep the label as

346
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,920
clean as possible. So like Kellyanne

347
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
said, we want you to focus on the amount

348
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,000
of calories or the amount of sugar

349
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,800
that's actually in products. Uh the

350
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,440
second reason is because uh flavorists

351
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,320
like my friend Stacy travel all over the

352
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,920
world to find the newest exciting exotic

353
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
flavor so that they can go back in the

354
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,920
lab and blend them and make the next

355
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,360
creative innovation of flavored waters

356
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,440
for you. They don't want somebody

357
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,680
stealing that and knocking it off. So

358
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,320
therefore, because it's all from natural

359
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,880
products, the FDA just requires that you

360
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,800
label it as natural flavor. So let me

361
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,399
cut to the chase. Are they safe?

362
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,480
Absolutely. In fact, they're used in

363
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,200
such small quantities, they don't make

364
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,880
an impact on any type of health outcome.

365
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,279
Now, here's what's interesting about

366
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,360
natural flavors. Natural really does

367
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,320
mean natural. So, they can come from a

368
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,600
fruit, a vegetable, an herb, or a spice.

369
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,480
My favorite vanilla natural extract

370
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,240
actually comes from uh beaver anal

371
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,320
glands.

372
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,680
Beaver anal glands. And it actually

373
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,279
tastes really great. What do you guys

374
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,680
think about that? Beaver Beaver anal

375
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,600
glands. even if it tastes great. And so

376
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,920
you you can actually mix that with other

377
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,639
flavors and actually get a raspberry

378
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,240
flavor out of that. Now, for most of you

379
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,320
all who are really grossed out with

380
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,959
that, we don't actually sell a lot of

381
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,000
those pro products on the grocery store

382
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,000
shelf because one, it's expensive to do

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
and two, we don't really have a lot of

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
beavers, you know, just kind of hanging

385
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,920
out around here. What a terrible job to

386
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,240
have. We harvest beaver anal glands,

387
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,839
right? Come on over here. So, Kill Hian.

388
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,639
Yeah. What do we pay attention to when

389
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,320
we're buying these these these flavored

390
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,240
waters that have no calories in them?

391
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,160
There's just one word we all have to

392
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,839
keep in mind. The big buzzword I want

393
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,519
this to be so prominent in everyone's

394
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,519
brain when they're looking for these

395
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,360
natural flavors. That's why we don't

396
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,800
want to get any of the artificial stuff.

397
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,399
It's simple. These are natural flavors.

398
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,440
It actually works for this. Now, Taylor,

399
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,519
if you prefer unflavored seltzer, you

400
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,000
got a little tool for us. Little hack

401
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,360
because I actually if I had my brothers

402
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,959
would only drink that. But I get that

403
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,639
you get bored of just a plain old water.

404
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,240
So, help me bump it up a little bit.

405
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,079
Hack it for me. Okay. Well, let's bring

406
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,720
a little food chemistry into your own

407
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,440
household. You can take those oranges,

408
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,360
uh maybe a little bit of mint or lime

409
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,079
and muddle those together because again,

410
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,320
you want to let those uh oils escape

411
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,480
from the food like a mojito. Yeah. And

412
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
you can even actually cook them on top

413
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,240
of the stove for, you know, one or two

414
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,120
minutes to help bring those flavors out

415
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,680
again. Uh then add more water, dilute it

416
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,600
out, let it set overnight. Uh the next

417
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,000
day you can filter it through a coffee

418
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,760
filter to get rid of all the solids and

419
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
voila, it's your first step to becoming

420
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,199
a food scientist. Who want to taste

421
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,880
this? Who's up for this? Here you go.

422
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,279
Why not give it a shot? This is my

423
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
little gift to you. This is how we ought

424
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,440
to be doing it if you want to avoid

425
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,120
anything. But at least you know what to

426
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,680
look for. You share it down the aisle.

427
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Up next, can you really eat 5,000

428
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,920
calories of junk food in one meal?

429
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,880
Can you and lose weight? It's not about

430
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
whether you can do it. Can you actually

431
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,580
do it and lose weight? Think about that.

432
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,779
We'll be right

433
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,779
[Music]

434
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,440
back. Now, you know how much I love

435
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,560
yogurt. But did you know just how much

436
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,720
sugar oo could be added to just one cup?

437
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,760
All

438
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,760
new. That's coming up on Wednesday.

439
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:12,639
[Music]

440
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,639
This meal is super

441
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,570
[Music]

442
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,880
filling. That was actually chicken gravy

443
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,560
mash. And that's not all. Imagine eating

444
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,680
all these epic meals. These are real

445
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,480
meals. Has eaten giant fries, onion ring

446
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,240
sandwich, right? a three-p pound pastry,

447
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,560
right? That's pretty large. And a

448
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,240
ginormous mac and cheese steak sort of

449
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,920
looks like this thing I got behind me. I

450
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,920
got closeup of it there. Look at that.

451
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,160
But yet, despite that, this Instagram

452
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,920
sensations gone viral for his health.

453
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,600
Secret to losing more than 60 pounds.

454
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,759
That's in before, and that's after. And

455
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,199
that's really his physique. Blake Horton

456
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,000
says he eats 5,000 calories in one meal

457
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,279
just once a day. It's not just a fitness

458
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,639
fanatics trick, guys. There are women

459
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,560
who are trying this as well, more and

460
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,320
more. Today we're investigating this new

461
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,480
extreme form of internet rather

462
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,399
intermittent fasting that's all over the

463
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,720
internet. Can you really eat all those

464
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,240
calories in one sitting and lose weight?

465
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,880
And here's the other question. Is it

466
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,320
even healthy? Please welcome Blake. I

467
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,320
got to say, you have captured the

468
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,720
nation's attention. Half a million

469
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,240
people watch you eat every night. I've

470
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,320
witnessed this myself. Why are you so

471
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,320
passionate about how you eat your food?

472
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,759
When I figured out how to eat what seems

473
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,920
like a cheat meal every night before bed

474
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,399
and lose weight and get all your daily

475
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,839
nutrients at the same time, there's no

476
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,759
reason not to be hooked and also no

477
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,880
longer get hungry. So, I just we're

478
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,839
going to get into all these bits because

479
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,839
it's it's it's so much so different from

480
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,279
any of us thought was possible. But how

481
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,279
did you learn about this? Who taught you

482
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,279
you could even try this? I was losing

483
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,720
weight um eating small meals spread out

484
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,880
throughout the day, which I was

485
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,639
miserable. You know, when you understand

486
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,399
your caloric budget and you're counting

487
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,480
calories and you try to spread it out

488
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,880
over three, four, five meals, shakes,

489
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,959
snacks, you have like you're calorically

490
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,959
broke. You have no budget, right? And

491
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,799
when you shrink that down, I read about

492
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,600
intermittent fasting and it said you can

493
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,600
eat fewer meals, same daily caloric

494
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,679
allowance,

495
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,319
reduce

496
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:20,720
hunger, go to bed happy and and full,

497
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,959
right, with a giant food baby and

498
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,039
continue to the same progress. So I

499
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,439
decided to test it out and I took it to

500
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,760
everything I do is like to an extreme. I

501
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,679
took it I'm sensing that. Yeah. So, I

502
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,080
got really creative with it and I

503
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,919
reduced it to one meal a day, which I

504
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,200
didn't know anybody at the time like who

505
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,840
was doing that. So, the longer you wait

506
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,440
to eat, once you get used to it, you

507
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,840
don't you no longer get hungry. If you

508
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,600
eat in like a 4hour time period, all

509
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,520
your calories, all your nutrients in a 4

510
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,440
hour time period, you're not going to be

511
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,400
hungry. Not nearly as much as if you did

512
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,679
three meals or four, five, six, like the

513
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,200
Let's Let's kick the tires on this.

514
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,520
We're going to investigate first of all

515
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,360
what Blake's eating to lose weight. So,

516
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,919
walk me through your meal plan and just

517
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,240
bring everyone up to speed of of why you

518
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,679
would eat this. And just to be clear,

519
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,840
okay, this is what it actually looks

520
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,600
like on the Instagram feed. But all of

521
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,280
these things went into this. So, take

522
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,960
your time. Explain what this is. And

523
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,440
this is about 5,000 calories we

524
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,200
calculated. This is this is a little bit

525
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,760
higher calorie. I believe mine was uh

526
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,919
was around 4,000 calories. But I see I

527
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,160
do see a lot of oil here, which I didn't

528
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,520
have on mine. Oh, okay. Here, I'll fix

529
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,840
that. If you could just Yeah. Yeah.

530
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,480
There we are. Okay. It's 4,000 calories.

531
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,080
So, this is all 4,000 calories in here.

532
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,400
All right. There you go. Yeah. I didn't

533
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,400
recognize that. So, what do we have? We

534
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
had some um salad and vegetables. Yeah,

535
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,520
we had about four pounds of vegetables.

536
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,880
Everybody asked if I eat fruits and

537
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,960
vegetables. Most of my meals have like

538
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,440
four pounds of vegetables or like three

539
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,880
pounds of fruit. But everyone sees the

540
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,720
cheese sauce, the dressing. Um, and this

541
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,160
it's some some low calorie uh cheese

542
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,600
sauce. What about the f French fries?

543
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,600
They're not the health food normally.

544
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,919
Fries. I mean, they are potatoes.

545
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,559
They're not like deep fried fried like

546
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,799
for hours. I mean, the fries I use are

547
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,640
probably between like two to three grams

548
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,559
of fat per 3 oz serving of. So, you're

549
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,799
very thoughtful about the cheat foods. I

550
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,400
count all my I count all my nutrients.

551
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,320
And what time do you normally eat? I

552
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,240
normally eat usually around like 1 to 2

553
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,919
am. Yeah, I thought that was the case. I

554
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,200
figured that's impossible. Why? Why at

555
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,400
that hour? Because I go live on

556
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,240
Instagram and everybody's like, "Why are

557
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,880
you live in the middle of the night?" My

558
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,200
schedule is just packed. Like I like

559
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,280
eating at the end of the day. Um because

560
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,480
I mean, biologically, we were meant to

561
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,799
to feast and fast. And when we when we

562
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,480
feast, we go to sleep. You digest while

563
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,080
resting. A lot of people have heartburn,

564
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,360
indigestion, acid reflux. Yes. I mean,

565
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,120
I'm sure plenty of people here have had

566
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,880
I've had it in the past, too. But when

567
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,200
we go out to eat a lunch and then we you

568
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,960
try to walk off your big lunch or you go

569
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,039
try to run it off or go to the gym after

570
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,280
eating and your body's trying to digest

571
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,200
all this food while moving. That can

572
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,360
cause a lot of those issues where I eat

573
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,320
all my food and yes, I look like I have

574
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,320
a huge baby, but I digest while resting.

575
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,520
See, I I honest if I ate at 1 in the

576
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,799
morning, I wouldn't be able to sleep all

577
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,840
night. That would keep you from

578
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,039
sleeping. Yeah, for sure. That would

579
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,799
throw me off. And you know, this this

580
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,720
doesn't look so healthy to me. And this

581
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,360
for sure is a little bit petrifying as a

582
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,320
doctor. That's right.

583
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm surprised they recreated this.

584
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,520
We took a long time. We had to push

585
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,039
people up. So, let me go back through

586
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
this. This we come on over here for a

587
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,840
second. I'm going to walk you through

588
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,919
how I analyzed the food a little bit.

589
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,840
So, this is one meal you had, right?

590
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,159
Doesn't look as healthy as some other

591
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,520
meals that I could imagine you eating.

592
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,840
Is that a big hamburger? It looks like

593
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,880
Yeah, it's a giant cheeseburger.

594
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,400
Cheeseburg cheeseburger. It's a

595
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,159
cheeseburger, believe me. All right.

596
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,000
Look over here. calorie content for

597
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,679
that, right? Pretty significant.

598
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,440
3,385. So, it's less than the 5,000. I

599
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,520
said less than the 4,000 even that you

600
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,559
might have said. Fat was was almost 90

601
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,919
grams in carbs, 391 gram. Right. Here's

602
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,559
another one. This is this is a sort of

603
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,080
some pizza. This is a pretty big size of

604
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,159
pizza. It's bigger than your torso.

605
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,559
Yeah. Right here. Here we had uh

606
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,720
3,974 calories, sugar 123 grams, sodium

607
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,120
8,46.

608
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,799
Well, that was for two of these slices

609
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,120
of pizza, not just one. How many did you

610
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,120
eat? Two. Well, then what's the total

611
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,679
The total was for two slices. Yeah.

612
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,120
Sure. Sodium's a little bit high, but

613
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,960
8,000. Yeah. For me, I mean, it's almost

614
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,159
double the recommended amount or a

615
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,159
little bit over double the recommended

616
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,760
amount, but I keep my potassium in

617
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,240
check. I'm sure you've heard about the

618
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,679
sodium potassium balance. And I'm also

619
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,360
into fitness, so I mean, I flush out the

620
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,480
sodium. Can I get Can I see your abs?

621
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,480
This is the This is what I'm talking

622
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,880
about. This I want to know how he eats

623
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,320
that food, that pizza, and has this.

624
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,520
So, part of the reason I want you to

625
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,640
come on, if you don't mind, is I

626
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,559
actually know that women are following

627
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,240
you and are losing weight on the

628
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,600
program. So, because they're off on

629
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,120
social media and they're looking at what

630
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,559
you're doing and imitating it, getting

631
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,480
success, I got curious. So, I've got

632
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,039
Kathy here with us. How are you, Kathy?

633
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,880

634
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:05,600
correctly, Greg, come join us. that

Kathy's lost 50 pounds in six months. By

636
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,760
the way, before you even start to go, is

637
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
that unusual for people who are

638
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,880
following you? Do do you hear these

639
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,960
stories? I have my own diet. It's the

640
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,200
Blake diet. And uh plenty of people have

641
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,840
watched my how-to videos, my tutorials,

642
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,480
and I have over 1300 people now losing

643
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,320
weight because 1300 over. All right. So,

644
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,640
you're one of the over 1300 people. Yes.

645
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,080
Tell me your story. Okay. So, um we

646
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,039
found Blake on the internet, my fiance

647
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,200
and I, Jamie. He's here today. Um he

648
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,360
found him on YouTube and we decided to

649
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,120
watch him. He start decided to start the

650
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,520
diet. He's like, "Oh, I'll give it a

651
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,440
try." I saw his success. The first week

652
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,679
or two weeks, he lost like 15 pounds.

653
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,640
Did it make you mad a little bit? Yeah.

654
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,760
Yeah. And I was just like, you know

655
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,280
what? I'm going to give it a try. I

656
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,679
mean, I have nothing else to lose. I

657
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,039
mean, I've done the whole traditional

658
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,720
dieting. And it didn't really work for

659
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,640
me. And I was never a breakfast person.

660
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,919
I could never eat breakfast. So, this

661
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,600
diet was just perfect. Where Where is

662
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,679
he? Where's he hiding? We'll pull him

663
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,720
up. Jamie. So, Jamie looks skinny, too.

664
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,000
He is. He lost 85 lbs. He lost 85 lbs.

665
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,600
Yeah.

666
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,679
And are you eating the same kinds of

667
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,320
food as Blake is? Uh, for the most part,

668
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,960
yeah. And scaled down into my calorie

669
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,720
intake, my burn. And your fiance is also

670
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,720
Yes. Did I say fiance or boyfriend?

671
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,120
Fiance. Yes. Just making sure. Okay. All

672
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,039
right. And the same kind of food. And

673
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,960
you say that you lost the the weight,

674
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,360
but you had other benefits also. Uh,

675
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,080
yeah. I had more energy. Um, I didn't

676
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,720
feel so sluggish. I felt better. My skin

677
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,240
cleared up. My hair felt better. And at

678
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,919
what time of day are you eating? Um, I

679
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,520
eat at midnight. You also eat at

680
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,039
midnight. What is going on here? It's

681
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,480
go. It's flies in the face of everything

682
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,760
we're talking about here. Come on over

683
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,960
here. So, I'm going to take you to the

684
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,159
truth tube. Blake, get on over there.

685
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,360
I'm going to put you in the truth tube.

686
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,480
Now, you know what this is, right? We've

687
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,559
talked about intermittent fasting

688
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,159
before. And part of the challenge here,

689
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,400
and just to be honest, I've never seen

690
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,919
anyone eat the portion sizes that you're

691
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,799
speaking about, Blake, or that you're

692
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,280
enjoying or your your fiance is either

693
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,400
who looks so healthy on the outside, but

694
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm actually more concerned about what's

695
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,039
going on inside of you. Mhm. So, you

696
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,880
allowed us to to to audit you, to put

697
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,799
you through a full examination, right?

698
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,360
We have all your blood tests. When we

699
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,120
come back, we got Blake's test results.

700
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,720
Is the diet that's blowing up on the

701
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,840
internet really healthy in the long

702
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
term? That's the real question I'm

703
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,690
asking. Is it something you ought to

704
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,880
try? Stick

705
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,880
[Music]

706
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,960
around. Eye drops. They seem harmless

707
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,320
enough, but did one woman use them as

708
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,750
the ultimate murder weapon? All new.

709
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,150
That's coming up

710
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,720

tomorrow. We're back with the question.

713
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,679
Is the internet's new diet obsession of

714
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,760
fasting and feasting on junk food

715
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,279
something you ought to be trying? Now,

716
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,039
you may get to eat thousands of calories

717
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,960
and shed pounds, but what's it doing to

718
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,039
your insides? Blake Horton, who started

719
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,480
this new trend, is back. We tested his

720
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,080
cholesterol and his blood sugar before

721
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,919
the show, and I asked him to keep track

722
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,400
of his sleep patterns, and the results

723
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,240
are in. Are you ready, Blake? I am

724
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,880
ready. You're ready. All right. You

725
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,159
confident? I'm confident. Okay. Total

726
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,159
cholesterol should be under 200.

727
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:07,159
Blakes's 118.

728
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,840
I I'm not quite sure how this is all

729
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,120
working, but I got to say that number is

730
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,799
nice. The blood sugar ought to be less

731
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:21,440
than 100, between 70 and 99 ideally.

732
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:22,720
Yours 84. Smack dab in the middle. I I I

733
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,400
was surprised. These are just two of the

734
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,080
lab results. I I looked at all your lab

735
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,799
results. Literally every single one was

736
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,720
in the optimal range. So I'm I'm a

737
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,640
little trying to figure out get my

738
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,720
footing back. But I have to say at least

739
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,120
on the insides of you, you look as good

740
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,880
as you do on the outside. But then I did

741
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,320
one more thing. I wanted to know whether

742
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,080
eating that late at night was messing

743
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,039
with your sleep at all. Do you think of

744
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,679
yourself as a good sleeper? Um if I get

745
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,559
the time to sleep, I sleep like a rock.

746
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,960
But with my schedule, I'm like basically

747
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,320
like a long napper. All right. Well,

748
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,840
long napping is a good way to describe

749
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,360
it because on average you were getting 2

750
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,880
hours and 45 minutes of sleep, which is,

751
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,400
you know, as your sleep score, there's a

752
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,320
little scoring system we have. Your

753
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,559
sleep score was 46. Let me show you the

754
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,000
actual chart. There's the 46. And it

755
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,360
look, you know, you got, you fell asleep

756
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
immediately like a rock. Told you,

757
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,880
right? But you weren't asleep very long.

758
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,240
You didn't get deep sleep. Uh, you

759
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,000
didn't dream. Do you remember dreaming

760
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,760
at all? Um, depends. Very rarely. Yeah.

761
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,919
18 minutes you're not dreaming. So,

762
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,279
usually. So I this is not surprising I

763
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,039
guess because you're not giving yourself

764
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,559
time. If you gave yourself time, would

765
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,200
it be better than this? One of my goals

766
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,200
in 2019 is to set my schedule where I

767
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,640
can get a good night's sleep. All right.

768
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,840
So I have to acknowledge I I'm shocked.

769
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,200
I've never seen anyone look as good as

770
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,880
you look eating what you've been eating.

771
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,159
So I asked my medical unit to dive into

772
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,440
you a little bit. What makes you

773
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,120
different? What makes you special? And

774
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,360
one issue in the back of my mind is you

775
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,640
do work out. And I wanted to figure out

776
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,640
how many calories do you really burn a

777
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,000
day? So I had the med unit calculated

778
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,080
out. They think that your calories

779
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,360
burned in a day because you have a lean

780
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240
muscle looking at your weight and

781
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,559
everything else, all the other

782
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,440
variables,

783
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,120
3,850 calories a day of burning of

784
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,200
calories. That's part of the answer. So,

785
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,600
if you're not burning 3,850 calories,

786
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,520
don't eat 4,000 calorie meals. It's not

787
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,039
going to work so well, right? Okay. So,

788
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,080
then that doesn't explain everything.

789
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,840
Let's get back to this intermittent

790
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,200
fasting issue because people are losing

791
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,480
a lot of weight who don't burn 3,850

792
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
calories and I want to understand what's

793
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,279
going down with them. Mhm. So, let's

794
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,440
just go through the average American and

795
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,960
how we all think about weight loss. The

796
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,120
average person starts eating their

797
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,320
breakfast at 7:00 a.m. and they're done

798
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,880
their dinner, whatever they're going to

799
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,200
eat by 10 p.m. That's about 15 hours. We

800
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,880
used to think calories in, calories out,

801
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,480
right? And when you eat like this, that

802
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,360
might be the case, right? Because if

803
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,559
you're going to have breakfast, lunch,

804
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,840
dinner, and snacks in between, you know,

805
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,520
it takes you a long time. It's a big

806
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,760
long eating window. Your metabolism is

807
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,240
going to want to deal with it as it can

808
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,880
in peace meal. What you're arguing is

809
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,480
eat it all at once. get up at seven, go

810
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,320
to bed at whenever you're gonna go to

811
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,279
bed, and eat one meal, wherever it

812
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,200
happens to be. Well, the data seems to

813
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,039
suggest that if we shorten the window

814
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,960
when we eat, you might be better off.

815
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,399
You can eat the same number of calories

816
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,159
in a short period of time as you would

817
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,840
over the whole day and you lose weight

818
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,679
compared to what you would be eating.

819
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,440
Now, think about that. And they did a

820
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,360
study actually shortening it down to

821
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,919
just a 4-hour window of eating and

822
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,039
demonstrated results like yours. So, I

823
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,120
don't know how many of you are thinking

824
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,399
about this, but that combined with the

825
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,600
idea that you're not hungry because

826
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,520
you're not thinking about food, not

827
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,279
tempting yourself all day long might

828
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,760
make it work. The one issue that I've

829
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,880
got Mhm. is what kind of food you're

830
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,799
eating. So, the one beef would be you're

831
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,080
eating junk food. You're arguing you're

832
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,440
having fruits and veggies, but what do

833
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,799
you have to say to folks at home who

834
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,760
think they want to copy you? To the

835
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,440
untrained human eye, if you just assume

836
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,240
what you are seeing on the screen,

837
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,000
you're wrong. any any of my meals that I

838
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,440
make personally, if you would go to

839
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,440
order it out at a restaurant, it would

840
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,039
be twice the calories, probably more.

841
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,600
So, I'm using healthier versions of

842
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,399
everything, lower calorie versions. Uh,

843
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,600
my foods are higher protein, lower fat.

844
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,919
Um, my my meals, I'm weighing all my

845
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,000
ingredients. My meals are like, it's

846
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,480
like I'm a scientist in a lab, a mad

847
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,320
scientist making my meal to fit my daily

848
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,880
needs. The macronutrients work for you.

849
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,840
Macro. So, I micro and micro, but

850
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,000
they're across the board. doing your

851
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,360
homework. If people want to jump start

852
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,080
their way towards doing what you're

853
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,240
doing, what's the best way to start for

854
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,080
on a very basic level to just skip your

855
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,080
first meal of the day? If that's

856
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,000
breakfast, some people go out, they eat

857
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,080
a 500 calorie breakfast. They don't

858
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,320
really know or eat one at home to start

859
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,960
their day. If they would just save those

860
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,120
500 calories, 500 calories times seven

861
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,399
days a week is 3500 calories. That's one

862
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,440
pound of body weight. Yeah. And if

863
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,039
you're looking to lose a pound a week

864
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,559
and you're maintaining and you cut out

865
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,399
that 500 calorie breakfast, you're going

866
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,080
to lose a pound a week just like that.

867
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,080
Blake, you're intriguing to me.

868
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,320
Congratulations. Appreciate it. We'll be

869
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,320
right back.

870
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,039
[Applause]

871
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:49,520
[Music]

872
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,000
Up next, constipation confessions. Could

873
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,159
you have a mega colon? Plus, top experts

874
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,690
reveal the surprising food to get things

875
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:01,760
moving along again.

876
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:03,600
[Applause]

877
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,840
All right, let's face it. Let's face it.

878
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,240
We have all struggled with constipation

879
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,760
before. Am I right? Right. Once in a

880
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,600
life at least, sometimes a lot more than

881
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,360
that. But a shocking new headline is

882
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,679
opening my eyes to a whole new level of

883
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,159
being well backed up. There are reports

884
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:22,399
of a man whose colon expanded to seven

885
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:24,399
ines and actually burst because he was

886
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,840
so constipated. So many of my friends

887
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,080
and family have been asking me about it

888
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,440
that even I've gotten curious. So today,

889
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,880
do you have a mega colon? And could your

890
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,399
constipation be deadly? For the first

891
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,399
time ever, I'm going to show you what a

892
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,320
real meggaolon looks like. Think about

893
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,679
the word mega colon. My first

894
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,279
sisters-in-law Kristen and Carrie are

895
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,240
here. They say they are obsessed with

896
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,679
talking about their bathroom

897
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,159
schedules. So I got to say first, you're

898
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,559
very brave to be here. Well, what kinds

899
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,640
of things do you talk about, Kristen?

900
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,919
Um, I'm pretty regular, so I don't have

901
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,039
much to say on the topic.

902
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,440
So Carrie, what do you complain about

903
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,440
when you get constipated? What to do to

904
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,399
fix it? Yeah. And it comes up a fair

905
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:09,159
amount. Fair enough. Are you worried

906
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,159
about mega colon? Now I am.

907
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,480
I've got to bring an expert. So pay

908
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,640
attention to this. Gastronurologist like

909
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,520
Dr. Rashini Raj has been investigating

910
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,960
this story which was ripped from the

911
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,399
headlines. So you got the details. So

912
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,000
just everyone's on the same page. What

913
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,559
actually happened with this case? So

914
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,320
this was a 24 year old young man who had

915
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,320
chronic constipation for about four

916
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,080
years but then for about two weeks it

917
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,399
was much more severe. He had severe

918
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,480
abdominal pain a lot of bloating and

919
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,399
distension of his abdomen. So he went to

920
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,240
the ER and this is what they found. So

921
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,200
this is a measure that I'm standing like

922
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,960
this and you cut at me in half this way

923
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,200
right? So you actually cut see half my

924
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,559
body and this is the line of his colon

925
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,440
way bigger than it's supposed to. That's

926
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,519
the spine by the way. Yeah. in the back.

927
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,000
So basically from his spine to his belly

928
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,760
button which is about here. He's got a

929
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,120
colon taking up the whole space. You go

930
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,799
to the bathroom down here, right? The

931
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,480
rectum's down here. It's your pelvic

932
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,120
bone. So that's a this is a long

933
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,559
distance, right? 7 in which is much much

934
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,080
larger than you want your colon to be.

935
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,919
And you're going to feel it. Now they

936
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,919
sent him home with some laxatives, some

937
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,320
enemas, but he showed up again two days

938
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,720
later, even worse pain. And this is what

939
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,679
they found. We call this free air in the

940
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,760
abdomen. This means the colon has burst.

941
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,120
There's a perforation, a tear in the

942
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,640
colon. This is actually a

943
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,320
life-threatening emergency because you

944
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,399
can get an overwhelming infection of

945
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,399
your entire body. So again, this is the

946
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,039
colon in here, the area that we had the,

947
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,120
you know, air in before. This is all air

948
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,960
that's now inside the belly but the

949
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,039
intestinal system. That is a surgical

950
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,720
catastrophe, emergency. It's a big

951
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,080
problem. So let's show everybody how

952
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,480
this actually happens. How a colon

953
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,320
becomes a mega colon. So we pulled

954
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,679
together a little animation and I'm

955
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,399
going to walk you through it so to

956
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,039
speak. So right here next to me is your

957
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:54,960
colon. And when you eat food we fecal

958
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,039
material waste traveling through starts

959
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,360
to move up the colon and then it travels

960
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,039
across the colon over here. Right? And

961
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,279
then I'll step over here. It comes down

962
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,799
the descending colon and then this is

963
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,039
pretty typical if you have constipation.

964
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,200
It'll get stuck here. You all see this?

965
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,519
This is regular constipation. But here's

966
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,679
the problem. When this colon starts to

967
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,000
dilate up, get really big and stretch

968
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,559
out. That's the the term we use in

969
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,640
medicine for a mega colon and it can

970
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,240
distend severely for a bunch of cases,

971
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,159
but chronic constipation is one of the

972
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,559
things if it's untreated for a long time

973
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,799
that worries us. And a mega colon can

974
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,600
lead to perforation because it gets so

975
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,039
big it pops. And that's surgical

976
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,360
emergency that we were showing you with

977
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,279
those X-rays earlier. And that can also

978
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,000
lead to sepsis and a bad infection. So,

979
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,399
Dr. You actually found a picture of a

980
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,159
mega colon. This is unique. It's

981
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,519
displayed in a museum. Yeah. I mean,

982
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,640
look at this. This is actually dates

983
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,039
back to 1892. And this is a a museum in

984
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,519
Philadelphia where a 29year-old man,

985
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,919
lifelong constipation, actually was

986
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,159
unfortunately and sadly found dead in

987
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,240
his bathroom. He died while trying to

988
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,240
have a bowel movement. Severely

989
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,360
distended mega colon. They call it the

990
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,440
giant mega colon. So So I've never seen

991
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,280
one in person.

992
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,560
But for the first time in 10 years, we

993
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,320
have a megolon to show the

994
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,720
audience. Carrie is back to She's been

995
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,280
whining to her sister-in-law about this.

996
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,720
Are you ready to see a mega colon?

997
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,159
I am. You are. She says with great

998
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,720
trepidation and not a lot of confidence.

999
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,520
Okay. So, first of all, a healthy colon

1000
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,079
looks like this. All right. This colon

1001
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,240
is not gargantuan. You I've shown you

1002
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,200
colons before and this is about the

1003
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,760
right size. But

1004
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:42,079
this is what a mega colon looks like.

1005
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,679
Compare these together. Do you see how

1006
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,839
much larger that is? Compare this colon

1007
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,399
to this

1008
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,159
colon, right? I mean, it's a lot bigger.

1009
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,919
And this is the difference between a

1010
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,679
regular colon with constipation and a

1011
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:58,000
colon that's gotten large from chronic

1012
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,599
problems. It's, you know, less than half

1013
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,200
the size of the mega colon. Thoughts on

1014
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,760
this?

1015
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,400
It's pretty gross and pretty big and I

1016
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,040
never wanted that to happen to me. Does

1017
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,800
this want you to get take your

1018
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,480
constipation a bit more seriously?

1019
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,400
Definitely. All right, that's a good

1020
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,560
idea because Dr. A, it's not just about

1021
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,839
drinking a little more water or tiny bit

1022
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,599
more fiber. What What are the reasons

1023
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,079
you get a mega colon? So, but getting a

1024
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,839
meggaolon, it's a rare uh complication

1025
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,920
of constipation, but there are also

1026
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,440
people who are lacking the nerve cells

1027
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,880
in the lining of their colon that help

1028
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,880
move things along. So, they might

1029
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,440
develop meggaolon. People with Crohn's

1030
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,119
disease or colitis, if it's untreated,

1031
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,200
they can get a severe distension which

1032
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,200
leads to what we call toxic mega colon.

1033
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,040
For most people with constipation, their

1034
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,720
colon is still going to look like this.

1035
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,400
It's going to have the normal diameter,

1036
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,160
but you want to keep an eye on it. If

1037
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,599
you feel after several weeks that you're

1038
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,680
not moving your bowels, you're starting

1039
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,359
to get pain or discomfort. You may be

1040
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,280
down this road and you want to do things

1041
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,280
not just drinking water but increasing

1042
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,720
your exercise intake, your fiber intake

1043
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,640
and speaking to your doctor about other

1044
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,280
measures so you don't go from this

1045
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,040
normal size to this mega colon. Stay

1046
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,720
here and guard the mega colon. I will do

1047
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,720
that. That many of them never had one

1048
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,599
before. Let me ask Dr. Raj important

1049
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,680
question. How do you know if your

1050
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,280
chronic constipation? Yeah, which car

1051
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,119
many others are suffering from has

1052
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,960
become more of a medical emergency.

1053
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,800
Whether it's become a mega colon. So a

1054
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,040
mega colon is going to give you first of

1055
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,200
all severe abdominal pain. You might

1056
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,200
even get fever or what we call sepsis.

1057
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,839
So other signs of real infection. But

1058
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,560
the hallmark is that distended hard like

1059
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,800
a drum abdomen. And to kind of diagnose

1060
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,560
yourself, you can really tap on your

1061
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,640
your abdomen when we do it with the two

1062
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,560
fingers. And it's going to sound kind of

1063
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,400
like it would if you did a drum or a

1064
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,720
balloon. So you want to know, is this

1065
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,000
full of air, a really distended colon

1066
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,280
that at some point could actually

1067
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
rupture. Just think about that. I mean,

1068
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,520
literally, that's what it's going to

1069
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,280
feel like a little bit. And that's how

1070
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,960
we diagnose the problem just on physical

1071
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,240
examinations. That's right. Yeah. Up

1072
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,440
next, what can you do to prevent

1073
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,599
constipation? We're revealing

1074
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,230
constipation confessions. The top ways

1075
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,730
health experts get rid of their own

1076
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,730
[Music]

1077
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:09,800
constipation. Here's your daily show.

1078
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:26,240
[Music]

1079
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:27,839
[Applause]

1080
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240
We've been asked the question, do you

1081
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,400
have a mega colon? And now it's time for

1082
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,920
the biggest constipation confessions. My

1083
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,000
go-to health experts are spilling the

1084
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,280
beans and what they really do when they

1085
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,760
get backed up. They're revealing the

1086
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,200
most common constipation situations and

1087
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,960
what you can do to get things moving

1088
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,960
again. Joining us is nutritionist Tanya

1089
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,359
Zuckerber. We're going to start with the

1090
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,480
stress constipation. tell us about this

1091
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,160
study. So I have found that when my

1092
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,079
clients get stressed that they often

1093
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,520
complain about constipation and I

1094
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,720
believe it's due to two factors. When

1095
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,480
people get stressed they don't drink

1096
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,240
enough water. They don't stop to drink

1097
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,760
and therefore the lack of fluid hardens

1098
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,119
the stool. The other thing that happens

1099
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,200
is when people are stressed we tend to

1100
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,119
eat emotionally and we eat things such

1101
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,880
as cookies and cakes and refined carbs

1102
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,480
that lack fiber. So they don't have the

1103
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,720
stool bulk that would normally be

1104
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,320
present to increase the stool so they

1105
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,599
could pass it. Yeah. Now personally when

1106
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,280
I get stressed out I have the opposite

1107
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,200
problem. But we'll get to that later.

1108
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,359
Fiber and magnesium smoothie is your

1109
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,280
solution. Yes. So, we have combined

1110
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,960
these two nutrients using two foods.

1111
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,440
We're going to get fiber by using a high

1112
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,440
fiber cereal. We have them here. And we

1113
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,280
have raspberries which contain fiber and

1114
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,440
magnesium. And because we want this to

1115
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,520
be addirect, put them in the smoothie.

1116
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,200
And because we are recommending this at

1117
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,200
breakfast, we want to make sure that the

1118
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,839
meal is complete. So, we added some

1119
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,920
Greek yogurt for protein and some almond

1120
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,280
milk. But you can use traditional milk.

1121
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,880
Any milk works. So you you want the

1122
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,560
liquid there really for the smoothness

1123
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,200
of it.

1124
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,200
I have to go already.

1125
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,520
It's that effective. It's perfect. So

1126
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,440
treatise, come over here. So Trice, you

1127
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,000
actually tried this out for a little bit

1128
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,359
for your stress constipation.

1129
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,880
The taste, I think you'll agree, is

1130
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,280
pretty good. Very good. How did it work

1131
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,800
for you? It really worked, Dr. Oz. For

1132
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,720
some reason, I've been constipated from

1133
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,400
working so much and the kids and so to

1134
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,040
have something that tastes good and

1135
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,880
that's affordable. It was like really

1136
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,520
quick to make and I actually

1137
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,560
incorporated into my diet cuz I want to

1138
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,359
move on the regular. Come move on me

1139
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,160
over here. We got another great idea.

1140
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,760
This is the away from home. You can come

1141
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,680
over here if you want. All right. Away

1142
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,720
from home constipation. Dr. Raj, you

1143
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,000
actually have confessed this is a

1144
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,920
problem you sometimes experience. You're

1145
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,359
not alone, by the way. Exactly. I get

1146
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,720
it. Many of my patients get it, my

1147
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,480
friends. Now, when you're traveling, a

1148
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,119
lot of things can throw off your system.

1149
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,800
When I do, my go-to trick is to bring

1150
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,400
some golden raisins with me. This is

1151
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,480
something I eat pretty much every day.

1152
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,240
It's a great source of fiber. It gets

1153
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,680
things moving. I just prefer the golden.

1154
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,960
You can use regular raisins as well.

1155
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,720
They're delicious and it's just like a

1156
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,920
nice little treat that helps you move.

1157
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,200
So, Tanya over there who made this

1158
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,599
little smoothie, she's also called the

1159
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,839
queen of fiber. Listen, I love Tanya.

1160
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,400
So, give us some other fiber hacks. Um,

1161
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,960
so women should aim for 35 grams of

1162
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,720
fiber a day. and it's easier to get than

1163
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,400
most people realize. Starting at

1164
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,760
breakfast, you saw we use the cereal in

1165
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,520
the smoothie, but just have a bowl of a

1166
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,119
high-fiber cereal. Look for one with at

1167
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,720
least 10 grams of fiber or more. There

1168
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,240
are plenty on the marketplace. For

1169
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,320
lunch, as we enter into the winter

1170
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,880
months, you want something warm. So,

1171
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,000
have a bean soup, lentil, split pean.

1172
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,839
Um, both of these will give you

1173
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,800
approximately eight grams of fiber. And

1174
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,720
then when it comes to dinner, bulk up on

1175
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,079
what we call cruciferous vegetables,

1176
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,520
broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus. Um,

1177
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,599
these are going to have more fiber than

1178
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,280
things like potatoes. So, always serve

1179
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,640
two cruciferous vegetables and you'll

1180
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,720
get at least six grams of fiber with

1181
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,359
your dinner. Keep the mega colon away.

1182
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,960
Yes. T, by the way, has got the F factor

1183
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,720

put some photos up there of the mega

1188
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,920
colon which you can scare your family

1189
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,930
and friends with as well. We'll be right

1190
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,850

1193
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,560
Eye drops. They seem harmless enough,

1194
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,599
but did one woman use them as the

1195
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,120
ultimate murder weapon? All new Oas.

1196
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:16,200
That's coming up

1197
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:19,280
[Music]

1198
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,079
tomorrow. At 18 years old, Cheryl Hunter

1199
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,680
set off for Europe to become a model.

1200
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,319
What she thought would be a trip to make

1201
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:29,119
her dreams come true would become a

1202
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:32,280
nightmare she couldn't escape.

1203
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,440
No sooner did we land in France than a

1204
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,680
man wearing a camera around his neck

1205
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,680
approached me. He asked me if I was a

1206
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,160
model. Told me he make he could make me

1207
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,200
one if I were to just go off with he and

1208
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,800
his friend standing over there. That is

1209
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,800
how easy it is to become a model in

1210
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,760
France. They drugged me.

1211
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,800
They took me to an abandoned

1212
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,400
construction site and beat me

1213
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,280
mercilessly. They drugged me again and

1214
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,400
raped me repeatedly. They dumped me in a

1215
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,400
park in Nice 3 days later.

1216
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,599
After surviving the trauma of her

1217
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,680
attack, Cheryl set forth on a mission as

1218
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,240
an author and speaker to connect one

1219
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,480
another through painful experiences and

1220
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,000
help those find peace and forgiveness in

1221
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,079
life-changing moments that we didn't

1222
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,760
choose for ourselves. After hearing her

1223
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,599
speak, I knew I needed to hear more of

1224
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,160
her story. So, I invited her as a guest

1225
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,400
on my podcast so she can share more of

1226
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,400
her survival story with you. To listen,
