1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,040
Pork, tender, and misunderstood.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,640
Most people have no appreciation of how

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,559
valuable this could be in their diet.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,960
We have Oz approved cuts of pork.

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,960
They had a cleanness to it that I enjoy.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,080
And the ultimate bacon buyer guide.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,200
I didn't know about this. Is

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,000
unbelievable.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,880
Plus, her memory would erase in less

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,039
than 10 minutes.

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,240
She's living the real life version of

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,199
51st dates.

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,210
All I've got to focus on is right now.

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,840
Coming up next.

15
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,520
[Music]

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,520
Y'all ready for season 10?

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,520
Yeah.

18
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,480
[Music]

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,480
I love you guys.

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,009
[Applause]

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,120
We all love the taste and smell of pork

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,559
and bacon. You see it there, right? You

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
see how excited the audience is over

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,559
this? The crispiness, the juiciness, the

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
Oh, well, we can't forget about that

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,479
delicious flavor. It's all there bundled

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,479
up. But could there actually be a

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,960
conspiracy going on to get you and your

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,640
family to eat more bacon? And what are

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
the healthy cuts of pork you should be

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,799
buying for your family? Today, our

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,720
biggest bacon and pork investigation

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,720
ever. And I mean ever. We're going to

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,040
start with Jen from my audience. She

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,439
says she is enjoying the bacon boom. How

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,119
serious is your love of bacon and pork

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,320
and all things piggly?

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
Well, I think it all started because

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,119
recently I started a low carb, highfat

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,840
diet.

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,680
So, of course, everybody loves bacon and

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
I can get it anywhere everywhere I go in

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
the store. I I swear I keep waiting for

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,439
them to make a vending machine with

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,119
bacon in it, right?

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,799
And literally I breakfast, lunch,

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,159
dinner, I'm always craving it. I think

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
I'm I'm literally might turn into a pig.

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,960
I've been eating it so much.

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,159
All right. So, you speak for so many of

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
the audience. We get some answers for

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,640
you because I have some concerns as well

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,159
as some good things about pork and

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,920
bacon. So, I invited food investigator

55
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,840
and author of the Dorito Effect, Mark

56
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,479
Shasker, an investigative reporter

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,040
Marakmpo to help get to the meat of the

58
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,640
matter. But first, some have noticed

59
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,320
that fast food companies are adding more

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,119
bacon to the menus. Have you all noticed

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,119
that?

62
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,319
Right. As Jen was pointing out, you can

63
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,840
have vending machines practically at

64
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,879
this point. Why do you think bacon is

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
being pushed so hard, Mara?

66
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,760
Well, you know, pork prices are the

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
lowest they've been in decades. And so,

68
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,280
these fast food companies have

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,280
definitely taken notice. They are

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,080
loading their menus with bacon items and

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,720
we're literally eating it up. There's

72
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,720
also these reports of this partnership

73
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,720
between the pork industry and fast food

74
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,040
companies where the restaurants will add

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,760
bacon to their menus to help offset

76
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,360
sales slumps. So, this bacon boom may be

77
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,239
a little more orchestrated than people

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,680
are aware of.

79
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,360
And for that to work, you'd have to

80
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
assume that pork is cheaper. And in

81
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
fact, it has become cheaper. I just

82
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,400
don't understand why, Mark.

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,400
So, there's a a perfect storm of events

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,239
happening to keep pork prices low. For

85
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,319
starters, corn and soybeans, which are

86
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
the main constituents of pig feed, well,

87
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,480
that those prices are low. That means

88
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,720
the pork is cheap. The American pork

89
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,519
industry is massively scaled. The farms

90
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,760
are huge. We feed pigs antibiotics. That

91
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,840
makes them grow faster, brings the price

92
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,920
down. And to top it all off, there's a

93
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,159
trade war with China. Now, China

94
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,400
historically is an enormous customer for

95
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,879
US pork. They buy it in the hundreds of

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,159
thousands of tons. Well, with China

97
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,760
buying less pork, that means there's a

98
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
lot more of it around here for us to

99
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,519
eat.

100
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,040
So, the prices may not be a problem. You

101
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,159
mentioned one thing with antibiotic.

102
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,920
Well, a lot of people think if they go

103
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,280
to a fancy butcher shop or if the

104
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
packaging looks nice, that means there

105
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
won't be any of that antibiotics. That

106
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
is not the way to do it. The truth is, I

107
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
would say if you don't see otherwise on

108
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,799
the packaging, assume the pigs have been

109
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,560
fed antibiotics. Now, a lot of people

110
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
say to me, why is that? Why are farmers

111
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,799
out to just dump all these antibiotics?

112
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,239
What's going on? Well, here's the thing.

113
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,159
When you feed pigs antibiotics, they

114
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,640
grow faster. you can put more pigs in

115
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,360
the barn. That brings the price down.

116
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,120
Farmers get paid by the pound. So the

117
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,599
farmers that aren't using antibiotics,

118
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
they might actually lose money. So the

119
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,280
logic of the market dictates that if

120
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,760
it's allowed, they pretty much have to

121
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,159
do it.

122
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,879
All right. So Mara says the color is

123
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,040
critical.

124
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, you want to look for meat that is

125
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,760
light red to cherry red. You also want

126
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,280
to look for your fat. You want to make

127
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,360
sure that the meat is never like this,

128
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,799
never white or pale. You want to save

129
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,360
the white for the fat. You want to make

130
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,400
sure that that fat is nice and white and

131
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
creamy with no dark spots. Really tasty

132
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,440
pork is going to have that fat

133
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,160
interspersed and marbled in with that

134
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
lean meat.

135
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
This is not often what it looks like.

136
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,720
So, get picky now that you know what

137
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,960
you're supposed to look for. All right,

138
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,280
next issue. Mark, labels. And there are

139
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,639
lots of labels and some of them are

140
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,840
pretty commonly found. So, walk us

141
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,040
through the most common ones and then

142
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,520
you got a little surprise for us, I

143
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
understand.

144
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,479
Okay, so this is one we know certified

145
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,919
organic. This comes from pigs that have

146
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,080
never eaten feed that's been treated

147
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,840
with synthetic fertilizers or synthetic

148
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,840
pesticides. And if you see that

149
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,160
certified organic, it means no

150
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,000
antibiotics. So, you can trust that.

151
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,479
Now, most people think, oh, and that one

152
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
too, natural pork, right? You pigs are

153
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,000
outside, the sun is shining, the birds

154
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,400
are singing. That word, when it comes to

155
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,759
pork, that word natural, it tells you

156
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
nothing about how the pigs were raised.

157
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,960
It only tells you there's nothing added

158
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,800
to the pork after they were processed.

159
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,199
So, no preservatives or anything like

160
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,639
that. So natural is not telling a whole

161
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,800
lot. But here's the thing. If you do

162
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,120
like that idea of pigs outside, the

163
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,280
birds sing, the sunshining. What you are

164
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,440
interested in then is pastured pork.

165
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,039
This is the rarest, I would say. Really

166
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,400
hard to find. Go look for it at your

167
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,639
farmers market. But if you're into

168
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,680
flavor, that will blow you away. That is

169
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,039
my number one pork.

170
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,160
And you have one last little surprise

171
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,720
over there, which I didn't even know

172
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,240
existed.

173
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,479
Yeah. So there's a label you might see

174
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,400
called no rattopamine. And people say,

175
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,720
"What does that mean?" Well, ratopamine

176
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,720
is a drug. It's fed to turkeys, beef,

177
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,600
cattle, and pigs. And what it does is it

178
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,639
promotes lean muscle growth, limits fat

179
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,199
deposition. Basically, you get more meat

180
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,199
for a lower price. There are

181
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,800
consequences. However, the animals that

182
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,600
are treated with ratopamine can be quite

183
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,680
agitated and it can make the meat tough.

184
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,240
So, if you don't want pork treated with

185
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,240
ratopamine, look for this label or look

186
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,759
for the certified organic label that

187
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
those pigs also will not be treated with

188
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,199
ratopamine.

189
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
All right. So, we want to learn more

190
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,039
about this. He spoke to the pork gal. So

191
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,840
he said in part, "More than 300 studies

192
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,360
have affirmed ratopamine as safe and

193
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
there's been no confirmed human health

194
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,199
issues to eating the meat from animals

195
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,960
that were fed rattopamine." That's their

196
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,039
response and I understand that there's

197
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,639
probably some validity to that. But I

198
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,560
share your thoughts. If you don't want

199
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,080
to get that, your options here reward

200
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,759
people who are purposely avoiding the

201
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,280
antibiotics, avoiding back dopamine if

202
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,560
you think that's important. Now that we

203
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,479
know what to look for when shopping for

204
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
pork and bacon products, Mark and and

205
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,000
Mara scoured the supermarkets and talked

206
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
with butchers, actual butchers, about

207
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
the best cuts to buy. I didn't know any

208
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,080
of this stuff. I don't think you do

209
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,080
either. Stay with us. It's up next.

210
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,840
It's been 30 years since Ted Bundy's

211
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,440
execution, but his bloodline lives on.

212
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,199
He and his wife were able to have a

213
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
daughter while Ted was on death row.

214
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,479
Who is Ted Bundy's daughter?

215
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,919
Imagine knowing that you're carrying

216
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,199
these genes that you could potentially

217
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,960
become a psychopath yourself.

218
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,360
And where is she now? She changed her

219
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,880
name.

220
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,360
He's trying to pretend never happened.

221
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,680
Plus, she survived Ted Bundy.

222
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,599
I remember him asking me how I'd like to

223
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,000
die. And he put his hands on my throat

224
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,960
and started squeezing.

225
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,960
That's coming up tomorrow.

226
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,280
We were talking about the bacon and pork

227
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,199
boom, telling you what to look for when

228
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,720
buying the other white meat. And now I

229
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,319
have a guide to tell you exactly what

230
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,000
cuts to buy for your family. Mark and

231
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,400
Mar are back. Let's start with the most

232
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,160
important factor for many of you. Taste.

233
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,919
Mark, you're the flavor guy. What is the

234
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,520
tastiest cut of pork?

235
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,240
The tastiest cut is the pork butt.

236
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,280
The pork butt.

237
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,880
The pork butt. Now, it's not what you

238
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,599
think. It's not the butt. It is the

239
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,479
butt. It comes from the upper shoulder.

240
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,599
It is marbled. It is fatty. You can't

241
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,759
cook it like a pork chop. You got to

242
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,840
cook it low and slow. But it is

243
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,680
succulent and delicious.

244
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,400
Why would you call it the pork butt if

245
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
it's not from the butt?

246
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,720
To make it the butt of jokes, perhaps.

247
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,479
Did you all see that? Wait. So, it's

248
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,680
called the It's above the shoulder.

249
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,440
It's above the shoulder. Yes.

250
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,960
Crazy naming. Okay. Chef Alli Rosa

251
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,400
didn't question the name, but she sent

252
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,319
us this clip to show us how easy and

253
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,479
delicious it is to make pork butt.

254
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,080
The first thing I actually like to do is

255
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,919
cut up the pork butt because then you

256
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,610
have more surface for browning. Now,

257
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,720
we're going to start cooking.

258
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,720
[Music]

259
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,720
Now, we're going to salt the pork butt.

260
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,479
You want to make sure that every side

261
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,919
has a little bit of salt because you do

262
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,759
not want to be missing out on the flavor

263
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,360
here. Once your onions have softened a

264
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
little bit, now is the time to add the

265
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
pork butt. So now you're going to let

266
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,880
your pork butt brown, maybe for about 5

267
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
minutes, turning it over halfway

268
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,320
through. But the goal here is to really

269
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
get that brown color on the bottom and

270
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,519
on the sides of the pork butt. Once the

271
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,159
pork butt is seared, it's time to add

272
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,159
the rest of your ingredients.

273
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,399
And we're going to add two cups of

274
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,800
chopped herbs. I've used oregano,

275
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,320
parsley, cilantro, some chives, but

276
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,920
really this is a great excuse to use

277
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,200
whatever is in your crisper drawer. Then

278
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,560
we're going to mix everything in

279
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,800
together. Now, we're going to put the

280
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,800
top on.

281
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,560
All right, so we have some pork butt

282
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,320
right here. We all have a taste. Mara's

283
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,000
been tasting it and and actually Mark

284
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,760
Sher's mouth is so full he can't speak

285
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,399
for a while. So, describe the flavor,

286
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,600
Mara.

287
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,760
This is really, really tender. It has

288
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,360
just enough fat, so it's nice and juicy.

289
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,880
And the beautiful thing is it's going to

290
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,399
take on the flavor of whatever you're

291
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,080
cooking and marinating it with. It's

292
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
just delicious. I bet I could even get

293
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,480
my kids to eat this.

294
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,080
Yeah. You know, I tell you, I didn't

295
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,360
actually think it was pork when I first

296
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
started eating it. I wouldn't have get I

297
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,720
wouldn't have quite known it could have

298
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,240
been lamb. It but it had a a cleanness

299
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,880
to it that I enjoyed a lot. Mark,

300
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
it's just so soft and tender and juicy.

301
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,600
I I love it.

302
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,959
Right. So, we know what what flavor what

303
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,720
part of the pig dean. Okay. Come on over

304
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,680
here. Next to our buyer's guide is this

305
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,880
whole issue of price. Now, listen, folks

306
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,560
have to be careful about money. You're

307
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,600
an amazing reporter, but you're a mom

308
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,160
also.

309
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,120
And as and you know to be mom, do it the

310
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,800
right way. You got to pay attention to

311
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,480
money. Absolutely. So the two worlds

312
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,320
collide when it comes to being gourmand

313
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,760
having the the pig butt over there and

314
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,080
getting the best cut. What did you find

315
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,360
work?

316
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,240
Yeah, we all got to watch our family

317
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,279
budget, right? The pork shoulder is a

318
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,240
really affordable cut. You can buy bone

319
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,240
in or boneless. It's really rich in fat

320
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,760
and connective tissue. This is really

321
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,760
flavor on a budget because it's going to

322
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,079
be pretty much just as tasty as that

323
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,800
pork butt that we just had, but for much

324
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,000
less price,

325
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,760
right? So, it's very close. You see the

326
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,959
picture, everybody. Uh, but it's below

327
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,560
it. And because of that, it tends to be

328
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,000
a very good price. The pork butts a lot

329
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,839
more expensive than this. I checked into

330
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
it. These are all pretty affordable

331
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,040
prices for most folks. But if it's

332
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,519
important to you, Scholers Way to go.

333
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,959
Okay, last up, the overall healthiest

334
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,560
cut of pork, which I know you two don't

335
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,720
talk about very much, but I care about

336
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,880
this. So, Mark, ran the numbers. Your

337
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,640
thoughts. The healthiest selexia cut is.

338
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,920
Well, if you're looking for leanness, it

339
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:50,079
is the pork tenderloin. A 3oz serving

340
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,560
has 3 g of fat. It has 120 calories.

341
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,880
This is as lean as boneless, skinless

342
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,480
breast of chicken. But unlike boneless,

343
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,240
skinless breast of chicken, it actually

344
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,760
has flavor. That's why I love this.

345
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,160
That's right. That is the problem with

346
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,839
with boneless skinless chicken. It

347
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,279
doesn't have any. It's like tofu,

348
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,800
which you normally I'd like if you put

349
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,160
something tasty around it, but by itself

350
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,000
doesn't have anything. Just to put a

351
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,079
head-to-head comparison, here's that

352
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,320
generally speaking bland piece of

353
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,200
poultry. And and here's our tenderloin

354
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,800
pig. Three grams of fat, 120 calories in

355
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,640
the 3 oz serving. I think this is a home

356
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,839
run. Most people have no appreciation of

357
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,399
how valuable this could be in their

358
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,360
diet.

359
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,120
Am I am I saying it right?

360
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480
I was shocked to see these numbers that

361
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,920
it's the same nutritionally

362
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,040
and kids actually like this cuz I fed it

363
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,880
to our kids. All right. When we come

364
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,800

367
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,959
of pork. Talking about bacon.

368
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,360
Wake up with an Oz approved waffle and

369
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
pancake.

370
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,279
This is one of the best foods we have

371
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,200
ever discovered on the show.

372
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,360
And Steman Grim reveals lessons on

Oz. That's coming up on Wednesday.

375
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,440
Investigator Mars Compo is back with our

376
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,839
bacon lovers cooking guide to get the

377
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,360
crispiest, tastiest bacon ever. I know

378
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,639
how much you love bacon. Oh, yes. This

379
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,560
is, you know, she's been asking about

380
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,160
this assignment forever. So, I wanted to

381
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,000
challenge Mara to take this challenge to

382
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,360
make the best taking tasting bacon,

383
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
trying different cooking methods. No

384
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
matter what you like, you have to try

385
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,240
something different. Did you have fun?

386
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, I had a ton of fun. I make bacon

387
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,360
for my family all the time. I wanted to

388
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
test some new ways to make it.

389
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,880
Look at her smile. Look at this. She's

390
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,000
so happy about this design. Come over. I

391
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,760
had to have a little competition. You

392
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,040
know, it keeps the blood flowing. I've

393
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
got three audience members who are very

394
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,200
harsh critics and they're going to judge

395
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,800
the bacon preparations that you made.

396
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,079
Before we get to that, my judges, why do

397
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,079
you love bacon so much?

398
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,800
The taste, nothing like it. It's

399
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,959
delicious.

400
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,480
So, Jen is a taste person.

401
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,399
Actually, you Jessica, they're they're

402
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,480
drooling the words out. Jessica,

403
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
the flavor, the crispness, it's just

404
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,399
it's amazing. I mean, you can't go wrong

405
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,519
with bacon.

406
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,519
And Jaton, what do you think?

407
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,639
I like the fat. I like the flavor. I

408
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
really like the fat.

409
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,360
They all likes bacon for the same

410
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
reason. Because it tastes good. Mhm.

411
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,839
Little crispy, a little fat, got the

412
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,440
right amount of everything. Okay, come

413
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,560
on. You're in luck. As Mara documented

414
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,880
her bacon cooking testing on Instagram.

415
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,360
You're going to taste while we watch.

416
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,760
First up, bacon made on a stove top in

417
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,680
cast iron skillet.

418
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,760
This is what I know. This is my tried

419
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,880
andrue. It's bacon in the good

420
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:26,639
oldfashioned cast iron. And I actually

421
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:29,279
add a touch of bacon grease to my bacon.

422
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,200
Bacon on bacon.

423
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,200
I love it. Look at that bacon grease

424
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
pop.

425
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,480
So,

426
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,880
how did the cast iron skilled bacon turn

427
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,720
out?

428
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,240
You know, this is what I know, so I'm a

429
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,079
little bit biased. It does have its

430
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,240
downsides. There's the splatter, which

431
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,079
gets everywhere. You do have to watch

432
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,720
it. You have to flip it. The pan gets

433
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,880
hot spots. It might not cook evenly. But

434
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,560
this is the tried and true.

435
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,839
It's bacon at its best. It

436
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,839
is bacon at it best. What does the

437
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,720
audience think? Bacon testers, your

438
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,560
verdict on the cast iron cooked bacon.

439
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,639
Jess, Jen, you go first.

440
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,399
Cast iron. I love the cast iron because

441
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,079
I feel like it sears in the flavor and

442
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
almost gives it around the edge like

443
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,920
caramelized a little bit.

444
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,639
All right.

445
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,120
Delicious.

446
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,480
Jessica,

447
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,959
it's fatty. I love it. It's There's

448
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
nothing like it.

449
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,480
You're just like fat. If I said fat over

450
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,440
there in a bucket, you'd be eating it.

451
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,760
Tom, what do you think?

452
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,000
It It gave it a sweet taste to it. I I

453
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,079
liked it. It had a very light sweet

454
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,839
taste to it. It caramelizes a little bit

455
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,600
in the in the ski. It actually does make

456
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,440
a little bit like well well stated. All

457
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,920
right. Next up, bacon cooked in the

458
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,279
oven.

459
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,120
All right. So, I'm just going to set

460
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,399
this

461
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,279
to 375

462
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,880
and then I'm going to do three pieces of

463
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,800
bacon. So, this cooked much faster than

464
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,199
I expected it to. And look at these

465
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,720
pieces. They look perfect.

466
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,519
It looks so easy.

467
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,000
This was surprisingly easy. I put it in

468
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,920
the oven and I just forgot about it. I

469
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,800
didn't have to flip it. I didn't have to

470
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,560
turn it. And if you put foil down, you

471
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,360
don't even have to clean up afterwards.

472
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,639
This was a winner.

473
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
I don't know. I didn't know about this.

474
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,880
Is unbelievable. Well, actually, I I

475
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,920
want to comment on the the taste yet.

476
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,000
Jen, take it away.

477
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,519
I believe with the in the oven baked,

478
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,279
it's a little bit lighter, more crispy,

479
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
and it has a more smoked flavor to it,

480
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,560
which I think is really good. Let let me

481
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,360
guess, Jessica, you like the fat.

482
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,440
I like No, no, you're wrong. It's

483
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,760
candied and it's it's just, you know,

484
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
it's sweet. It's got that like crunch to

485
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,720
it and I love it.

486
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,959
And Jat, how does it compare to the iron

487
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,920
skillet? The cast iron skillet.

488
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,240
It has more of a fatty flavor to it. I I

489
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,279
I enjoy it. She took my my words as far

490
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,120
as the smoky. I have to use that again.

491
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,360
Sweet and smoky. It's a sweet and smoky.

492
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,440
I was a little surprised. You know, it

493
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,920
it's not as crispy, but it has a crispy

494
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,519
taste to it. Texture does delicious.

495
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,279
All right, last option. You ever think

496
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,480
you'd make Actually, I I never thought

497
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,759
I'd ever make it in bacon. After this,

498
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,279
I'm thinking about it, but let me get to

499
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,160
the last option. This is a method of

500
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,600
cooking bacon in water on a stove top. I

501
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,360
never thought this is possible. I've

502
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,639
heard about it from expert chefs. Take a

503
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,560
look.

504
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:14,759
I have the bacon on high heat and I'm

505
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,759
going to cover it with water.

506
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,199
Now that all the water has cooked out,

507
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,560
I'm going to try to crisp them up. It's

508
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,560
pretty much cooking like regular bacon.

509
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,959
So, honest opinion, you didn't seem so

510
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,720
excited about this method.

511
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,160
You know, I was a little bit skeptical.

512
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,240
I tried to approach it with an open

513
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,959
mind, but it turns out I was right to be

514
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,320
skeptical. This took way longer. I

515
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,920
didn't think the bacon came out that

516
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,800
great, and it was harder to clean the

517
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,160
pan afterwards.

518
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,759
Yeah. Look at the disaster on that

519
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,480
video. All right. Yeah, Jaton, you go

520
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,839
first. What do you think?

521
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,320
It tastes rubbery.

522
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,959
Rubbery?

523
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,279
Yeah. I don't care.

524
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,000
I love you. Honest.

525
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,920
Rubbery.

526
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,920
I know my bacon. Okay. Don't put on my

527
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,639
bacon. Okay.

528
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,480
Don't fool me.

529
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,959
It tastes rubbery. Yeah. I didn't care

530
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,759
for it.

531
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,839
All right, Jess.

532
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,519
It stole. I don't like it. I don't like

533
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,560
it at all. It's just

534
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,759
not like the other two.

535
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,199
Jen, do you agree with the panel?

536
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,480
No, I'm a little surprised because I

537
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,319
really like the cast iron and the oven

538
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,160
baked, but this it's not as crispy, but

539
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,360
it really brings out the pork flavor.

540
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,799
So, it tastes different than the other

541
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,000
two. Mara, which one would you what's

542
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,839
your conclusion of this experiment?

543
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,839
I got to tell you, this converted me. I

544
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,839
was a cast iron girl all the way, but

545
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,439
cooking in the oven was so easy and fast

546
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,520
and it tastes good.

547
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,360
The oven wins. We'll be right back,

548
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,600
everybody. Rethink oven. Rethink your

549
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,600
bacon.

550
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,360
Coming up in Oz exclusive, a sit down

551
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,679
interview with a young woman whose brain

552
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,360
resets every night and wipes out her

553
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,039
memories. Find out how she and her

554
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,880
family are coping with their new

555
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,460
reality. You won't want to miss this.

556
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,520
Our

557
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:50,080
[Music]

558
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,400
brains consist of a 100 billion cells

559
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,880
that help us retain and create memories.

560
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,120
The happy times, the sad ones, the

561
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,799
monumental moments that we can all think

562
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,799
back and remember. Now, it's a complex,

563
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,120
beautiful part of our biology. But what

564
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,280
if you woke up every day to a blank

565
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,360
slate with no recollection of what

566
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,640
happened months, weeks, or even the day

567
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,880
before? Kind of like that movie 50 First

568
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,039
Dates. That's what the headlines call

569
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,440
the case of 16-year-old Caitlyn Little,

570
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,679
whose brain resets every night when she

571
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,919
goes to sleep. But this isn't a movie

572
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,039
for Caitlyn and her family. This is real

573
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,039
life. Take a look.

574
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,720
It all started with a freak accident.

575
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,120
14-year-old Caitlyn Little was at cross

576
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,520
country practice. Some other kids were

577
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,520
goofing around and heads collided.

578
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,600
Later, when her mom came to pick her up,

579
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,799
Caitlyn went to the car and asked her

580
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,000
mom how to open the door. They knew then

581
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,520
that this was serious. The date, October

582
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,760
12th, 2017. That was a year and a half

583
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,880
ago. But to Caitlyn, it was just

584
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,880
yesterday, literally.

585
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,280
Every morning, Caitlyn's father wakes

586
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,520
her up, telling her the date and basic

587
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,799
facts. Today is April 10th, 2019. You

588
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,960
got hit in the head while you're doing

589
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,120
cross country practice at Southeast.

590
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,480
And then the next day, he has to do it

591
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,559
again and again and again. That's

592
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,360
because Caitlyn has a condition that

593
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,520
causes her brain to reset every night,

594
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,320
wiping out all her memories after the

595
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,160
day of the accident and leaving her with

596
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,640
severe memory impairment.

597
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,919
So to cope, Kayn and her family put

598
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,840
Post-it notes all over the house. In the

599
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,919
refrigerator, telling her what foods to

600
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,400
eat. In the bathroom, reminding her how

601
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,559
to brush her teeth. In her bedroom,

602
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
reminding her not to wear her sister's

603
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,559
clothes.

604
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,559
Cuz it gets on her nerves.

605
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,000
But after 18 months and little

606
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,320
improvement, Caitlyn's parents have

607
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,720
turned to some experimental therapies

608
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,559
like this hyperaric oxygen chamber

609
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,720
that feeds oxygen through there. It has

610
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,640
a little mask just like a nebulizer.

611
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,919
Some researchers believe it increases

612
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,080
oxygen to the brain to promote healing.

613
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,720
And just a few months ago, they brought

614
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,039
Caitlyn to a specialized chiropractor.

615
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,039
He is doing upper neck adjustments,

616
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,480
hoping to get her brain to function the

617
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,320
way it used to.

618
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,320
While doctors can't yet pinpoint the

619
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
exact mechanism causing Caitlyn's memory

620
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,919
loss in a way we can verify, we wanted

621
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,679
her and her family to share their story

622
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,679
as they're experiencing it in their own

623
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,520
words. Now, Caitlyn bravely made the

624
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,799
trip to New York. She is backstage.

625
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,559
There she is. And we're going to meet

626
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,080
her in just a minute. But first, I want

627
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,080
to talk to Caitlyn's parents, Jennifer

628
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,600
and Chris, who are joining us now on the

629
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,640
sofa. Thank you for being here and for

630
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,320
sharing your family story.

631
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
Thank you. Chris Chris, what's it like

632
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,159
for you every day, every morning to have

633
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,000
to reexplain the accident to your

634
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,080
daughter Kayn?

635
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,320
I've uh been the one to wake up all the

636
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,360
children every day. Uh while my wife

637
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,240
does practically everything else to get

638
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,799
him ready for school. So, uh each

639
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,400
morning I go in there to wake her up and

640
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,799
try to give her just the information she

641
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,080
needs to get started. I let her know

642
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,600
roughly what the temperature is going to

643
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,360
be, what the weather's going to be, and

644
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,159
then I let her know she has a journal on

645
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,840
her desk or um table next door. And then

646
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,640
she has note post-it notes that tell her

647
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,240
how to find that journal. Um, I tell her

648
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,039
that she should read her journal to get

649
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,480
caught up and if she has any questions,

650
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,919
come up and see me about 15 20 minutes

651
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,080
and I'll give her more details that she

652
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,280
needs. I try not to overwhelm her with

653
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,640
too much.

654
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,840
Jennifer, this has been a real journey

655
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
for you and the family.

656
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,320
Yes.

657
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,600
Take me back to the first moment that

658
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,000
you thought there might be a problem.

659
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,520
The first inkling there was an issue.

660
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,960
That's why I got kind of emotional

661
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,480
watching her run. Um, when we picked her

662
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,240
up, I picked her up, they said, "Hey,

663
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,320
Caitlyn had a head injury." Caitlyn has

664
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,159
had many injuries, as kids do when

665
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,080
they're athletic, and never ever has

666
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,080
said, "I'm in pain." I picked her up,

667
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,760
and we always do a rating scale of 1 to

668
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,400
10 for our pain. And she's like, "Mom,

669
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,159
this is a nine, maybe a 10."

670
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,159
Okay, Caitlyn doesn't complain. So, I

671
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,679
knew right away we were in trouble, but

672
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,880
I didn't know how much trouble at that

673
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,640
point. I was just like, "Well, gosh, you

674
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,960
know, you got hit in the head. camp. We

675
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
walked to the car and she just stared at

676
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,000
it and she's like, "What do I do?" I

677
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,320
said, "Well, we're going to go on home."

678
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,120
She's like, "No, how do I open the car

679
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,720
door? I don't remember how to do that."

680
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,080
And at that point, I sort of got her in

681
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,919
the car and trying to be real calm,

682
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,360
Chris. We have a real issue. When I get

683
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,480
home, you know, be ready. We need to

684
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,320
talk. Um, we did followed the school

685
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,640
protocol. We did all the things they

686
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,440
suggested we do for a normal concussion.

687
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,919
And in those first two weeks, her memory

688
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,880
would erase in less than 10 minutes. She

689
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,360
was resetting every 10 minutes of uh

690
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,960
that was all she could hold. And all the

691
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,280
doctors were like, "Oh, it's just it's

692
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,080
just a simple case of a concussion. It

693
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,799
will heal itself." And we started then

694
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,240
the journey of of waiting for it to

695
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,919
heal.

696
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,400
What's the most painful part for you as

697
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,159
a mom? I I I mean, you were remained

698
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,039
very emotional even watching the tape.

699
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,120
The tape was hard to watch because that

700
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,720
I guess in 18 months you kind of set

701
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,440
aside

702
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,799
all your feelings. I'd forgotten that

703
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,679
girl you guys saw running. I'd forgotten

704
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,840
the um personality you could see on that

705
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,880
face. And um we're worried. We're scared

706
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,640
that her milestones have stopped, that

707
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,080
we are just stuck on 24 hours and that's

708
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,120
going to be the rest of our lives is

709
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,360
just 24 hours. What's happened to her

710
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,720
school to her friends?

711
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,720
School has been um amazing. Her her

712
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,679
principal, her guidance counselor, her

713
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,200
teachers, and her intelligence is

714
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,080
intact. And that's what's hard for

715
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,400
people to believe. She is still very

716
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,799
smart and wants to accomplish. She wants

717
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,280
to live the rest of her life and and set

718
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,039
goals and achieve them. So, her teachers

719
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,039
are helping her do that.

720
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,080
Human body has an unbelievable ability

721
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,320
to recover.

722
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,840
Yeah.

723
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,159
In ways we can't even imagine.

724
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,679
Yeah.

725
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,720
And we get better at helping it do that

726
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,720
every single day.

727
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Yes.

728
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,600
So, I'm going to share with the audience

729
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,880
something you already know about what's

730
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,080
going on with your daughter. Yes.

731
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,520
Right. Because so far, doctors have not

732
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,880
been able to figure out why Caitlyn

733
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,960
can't retain new memories. But, I want

734
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,880
to do something. I want to show you all

735
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,880
a little bit about how memory works in

736
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,720
the brain because memories in the brain

737
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,240
are stored almost everywhere. It's not

738
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,440
just in one spot, but there's some place

739
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,120
that play a bigger role. And you know,

740
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,840
it might be a burger you happen to love

741
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,760
or maybe a baby that you remember uh

742
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,600
your graduation big moments in your

743
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,279
life. Sometimes just a mundane seemingly

744
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,880
mundane issues about being at work or

745
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,480
doing your homework or or having fun,

746
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,919
right? These are all different memories.

747
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,080
And what we think of as a single memory

748
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,840
is actually a collection of pieces of

749
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,799
memory stored in different parts of the

750
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,240
brain. And memory problems like amnesia

751
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,240
can be caused by an injury or

752
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,240
malfunction. You bang your head, right?

753
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,400
And all of a sudden that really complex

754
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,240
process where you can remember things no

755
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,440
longer is there. You get amnesia. Now an

756
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,799
antgrade amnesia and antrogate amnesia

757
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
is about the fact that you cannot form

758
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,080
new memories as well as as you normally

759
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,159
could. They they sort of a little

760
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,559
misformed, right? They're not quite what

761
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,120
they should be. And so you can remember

762
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,200
the information immediately sort of, but

763
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,080
you have problems storing those memories

764
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,159
long term. Interrogate amnesia is what

765
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,320
Caitlyn has. The memories before the

766
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,640
injury might be spared, but events since

767
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,960
the injury may be lost because they were

768
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,320
never stored. So, Caitlyn was diagnosed

769
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,799
with traumatic brain injury

770
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,000
postconussion, and this amnesia she has

771
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,520
believe is related to that. And her

772
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,120
family has met numerous doctors and

773
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,120
specialists to help to get her memory

774
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,440
back. Now, unfortunately, Caitlyn has

775
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,120
not recovered as adequately as you just

776
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,480
have witnessed talking to her parents.

777
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,400
But I want to check in with neurologist

778
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,640
Dr. Aisha Sherzai who's on the cutting

779
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,720
edge of brain science for some insights

780
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,640
and she's joining us now via Zoom. Dr.

781
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,320
Sherzai, how common is Caitlyn's

782
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,159
diagnosis and what's your advice for the

783
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,520
family?

784
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,240
Hi Dr. Ross. Um this case is very very

785
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,039
unique and extremely rare. I mean you

786
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,679
don't get to see interrogate amnesia

787
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,000
lasting this long. And just listening to

788
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,679
the parents and Caitlyn sorry my heart

789
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,919
goes out for them. I know how difficult

790
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,720
it is. you know, our memories are

791
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,039
ourselves. It's the stories of our self.

792
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,600
And when that is affected, uh, you feel

793
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,840
very destabilized. And it seems like she

794
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,440
has seen a lot of great doctors who have

795
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,520
done the normal, the standard

796
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,400
diagnostic, uh, procedures to find out

797
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,840
what was going on. And moving forward, I

798
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,720
think the parents have to be very

799
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,320
careful and discerning who they contact

800
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,480
and who they come across with because

801
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,120
there are a lot of people with promises

802
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,440
of potential cures that may cost a lot

803
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,440
of money and may not be in her best

804
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,279
interest. So, they need to be very

805
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,279
careful about that. And you know, the

806
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,919
most important thing is uh for the mom

807
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,320
and dad to know that they are the ones

808
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,240
who know her best. They are her best

809
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,720
advocates and they have to make sure

810
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,720
that they support her and love her and

811
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,720
like you said, you know, the brain is a

812
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,240
very susceptible organ, but it's also

813
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,400
very forgiving.

814
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,400
Dr. Shai, thank you very very much. So

815
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,159
guys, one thing's clear to me for sure.

816
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,080
You're a family. You're closely knit.

817
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,679
You're bonded. You've got four children.

818
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Caitlin is number two, I think, right in

819
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,080
the list. So you guys can do almost

820
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,840
everything together, which means you can

821
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,200
support each other no matter what

822
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,520
ailments we're suffering from. That's

823
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,120
almost historically pulled up together.

824
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,559
Siblings are all backstage, right?

825
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,120
They're hanging out with Kaitlin. There

826
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,720
they are supporting her. And even if she

827
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,840
takes their clothes, she can now claim

828
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,080
she doesn't remember doing it. Most

829
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,400
families don't have that excuse. It is a

830
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,080
beautiful thing to see a family come

831
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,120
together, even if it's around a tragic

832
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,960
event. And as I look to what you guys

833
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,720
will be doing in the future, that ends

834
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,320
up becoming the foundation of it. So

835
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,360
when we come back, I'd like to meet

836
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,600
Caitlyn if that's okay.

837
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,960
Okay.

838
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,559
Okay. And you all will as well. We're

839
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,520
going to hear her message that we can

840
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,520
all learn from. That's next.

841
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,600
[Music]

842
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,600
I love getting to talk with you on my

843
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,840
show every single day. But when the

844
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,159
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

845
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,240
is not over. I still have a lot that I

846
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,960
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

847
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,679
Rod podcast on Apple Podcast or wherever

848
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,919
you get your podcast.

849
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,159
Good morning, sweetheart. It's March

850
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,440
20th, 2019.

851
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,799
You got hit in the head while you're

852
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,559
doing cross country practice at

853
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,919
Southeast.

854
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,000
You haven't been school for a little

855
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,799
while. Okay. You've got a journal over

856
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,880
on your desk that helps explain things.

857
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,559
For more than 18 months, nearly 600

858
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,080
consecutive days. That is the message

859
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,919
Chris Little has used to wake up his

860
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,080
daughter Caitlyn every morning. The

861
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,320
incident he just told her about left her

862
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,919
with a rare form of amnesia that resets

863
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,600
her brain while she sleeps. Caitlyn is

864
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,080
joining us now with her parents,

865
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,360
Jennifer and Chris. Thanks for being

866
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,880
here. Help us all understand what it's

867
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,320
like to wake up every morning with that

868
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,080
same message from your father that

869
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,840
you've had a head injury and you

870
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,760
probably don't remember what happened

871
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,120
yesterday.

872
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,880
As with most anyone I could imagine,

873
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,480
it's disbelief. You say, "No way. You're

874
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,640
joking.

875
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,399
Stop pulling my leg. There's no way it

876
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,320
could be over a year and a half since

877
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,520
October. I mean, it hadn't even been

878
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,399
Halloween yet. But then I look around,

879
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm like, things things are a lot

880
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:26,640
different. I mean, a lot has changed.

881
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,360
And you get a weird feeling inside

882
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,440
yourself saying something's something's

883
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,880
not right.

884
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,880
What's changed the most that you've

885
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,880
noticed?

886
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,600
My family has changed a lot. Not just

887
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,919
physically, but I can see it

888
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,760
emotionally, too.

889
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,240
My sister has become a lot more

890
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,559
confident through this all, as well as

891
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:58,720
my brother. He's grown a lot taller,

892
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,720
but he's also become more

893
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,720
um

894
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,960
what's the word?

895
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,600
Confident.

896
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,399
Mature.

897
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,919
Mature. Yes. Mature.

898
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,720
When you woke up this morning in your

899
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,200
New York City hotel room.

900
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,640
Yes.

901
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,840
What What did you think you were doing

902
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,760
today?

903
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,760
What did I think I was doing? Did you

904
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,120
remember that you were coming here?

905
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,880
No. No, sir. I did not. I had no idea

906
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:32,080
when I woke up that I was in New York or

907
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,880
where I really was. I did not know I was

908
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,919
in a hotel room,

909
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,360
which was a big shock.

910
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,159
So, you're living your life with these

911
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,840
Post-it notes, and this is your journal.

912
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,760
And I just note, it says, "Read me. I am

913
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,120
your journal." And this says, you know,

914
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,640
flip me up and read me. So that you even

915
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,360
have notes to remind you to read it. But

916
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,480
what what is it what is it like to have

917
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,919
to use these notes to remind yourself of

918
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,360
the activities of of everyday living?

919
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:06,399
It's a lot like reading a book. I mean,

920
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,279
since I don't really remember,

921
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,840
I can't

922
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,039
pull that memory and say, "Oh, yeah. I

923
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:18,080
remember what the clouds look like or I

924
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:21,360
remember looking at that dog when we

925
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,720
were sitting at the restaurant. So, I

926
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,440
can kind of

927
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,679
picture of what it would be like, but

928
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,880
it's it's not the same as actually

929
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,360
remembering anything.

930
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,919
So, when you had your injury and all all

931
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,440
of us sitting here listening to you do

932
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,519
start to think it's sort of like that

933
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,399
movie that I thought was Make believe 50

934
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,960
First Dates.

935
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,679
Mhm.

936
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,080
Does it bother you to be compared to the

937
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,559
the woman in that movie?

938
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,919
It doesn't bother me to be compared to

939
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,559
her. I think it helps people understand

940
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:00,080
more

941
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:03,640
because yeah, she could remember, but

942
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,640
she could also

943
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:11,360
point out things that I might not be

944
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,519
able to that are hard to do.

945
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,240
Chris, what do you as you watch your

946
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,120
daughter now?

947
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,559
She seems like she's obviously very

948
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,039
understanding what's going on.

949
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,960
She's very very smart and she has a very

950
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,320
good grasp on things and she's handled

951
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,320
it way better than probably the rest of

952
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,320
us would have. She has a very good

953
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,159
attitude.

954
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,559
It's been hard in the parents.

955
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,919
Yes.

956
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,360
Much as your daughter.

957
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,840
Yes.

958
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,799
She tells me that quite often that we um

959
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,519
she has it easy that she sees that we're

960
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,519
the ones that are much more emotional

961
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,440
because as she says she's going to wake

962
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,200
up and start over tomorrow that the

963
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,600
emotions don't build for her like they

964
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,600
do for us.

965
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,159
Is that right, Caitlyn?

966
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,640
Mhm.

967
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:05,679
I mean I really just take it

968
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,799
right here, right now. I can't really

969
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,360
look forward to what am I gonna do

970
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,919
tomorrow night for dinner. I don't know.

971
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,960
Maybe I'll want chicken. Maybe maybe

972
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,919
tacos sound good. All I've got to focus

973
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,720
on is right now.

974
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,720
This is where we are.

975
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,679
So, here's what I like to do. I can't

976
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,840
promise a solution or an answer. This is

977
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,000
an incredibly complicated process.

978
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,240
You're going through it. Uh what I do

979
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,159
want you to have is hope. So we're

980
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,919
reaching out to some doctors who have

981
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,919
done research in this area just to be

982
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,679
able to collect more

983
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,440
to help you and we'll connect you

984
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,200
directly to them.

985
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,720
That's okay. We'll start with that.

986
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,559
You'll certainly be the world experts on

987
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,720
this when you're done and hopefully

988
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,799
you'll find some paths as well to at

989
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,399
least get you to continue to improve

990
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,120
more than you have already.

991
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,480
Absolutely.

992
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,399
Sure. We appreciate it.

993
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,399
And and I want to say it's all to

994
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,880
everybody else. You know, I you have a

995
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,679
gift in a way, Kaylin. What you just

996
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,839
said right now is very profound. You are

997
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,879
forced to live in the moment. Many of us

998
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,359
have never lived until we've lost it

999
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,960
all. And at least you're day in and day

1000
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,159
out, even if it's for that one day doing

1001
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,879
what all of us should be doing, which is

1002
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,399
living that day. There's I wish you the

1003
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,560
best of luck in carrying that out. Don't

1004
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,399
lose that hope. We'll continue to follow

1005
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,159
Caitlyn's journey and find out how you

1006
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,399
can donate if you wish to to the

1007
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,290
GoFundMe page by coming to dr.com. We'll

1008
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,800
be right back.

1009
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,320
[Music]

1010
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,159
And up next is the eye-catching

1011
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,159

trend.

1015
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:52,320
[Applause]

1016
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,760
It's the red hot health trend everyone's

1017
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,720
going to be drinking this summer.

1018
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,240
Hibiscus tea. This colorful tropical tea

1019
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,839
is getting a lot of attention all over

1020
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,520
the internet and today we're breaking it

1021
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,520
down. What do you need to know about

1022
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,440

podcast, Talia Pollock. How are you,

1026
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,640
Talia?

1027
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,240
Great.

1028
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,720
You're you're dressed in hibiscus

1029
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,839
colors.

1030
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,520
What a coincidence.

1031
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,119
Oh my goodness. Completely match

1032
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,520
coordinated. So this tea is showing up

1033
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,640
in coffee shops all over grocery stores.

1034
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,560
Obviously people talking about it

1035
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,160
Instagram. What's What's it about? Why

1036
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,640
is it so popular? Why now? I mean,

1037
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,560
clearly it's eye-catching and so it's

1038
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,400
super fun and everyone's looking for

1039
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,480
great ways to stay hydrated. And so,

1040
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,320
here's one that has no calories, is

1041
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,760
super nutritious, and tastes so

1042
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,200
refreshing iced.

1043
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,960
So, there's lots of things, lots of

1044
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
reported health benefits for this little

1045
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,800
tea. Give that a taste. Let's see what

1046
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,119
you think. Everyone likes the taste, but

1047
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,320
doesn't really help you physically.

1048
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,440
Doesn't really taste like anything.

1049
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,359
Doesn't taste like anything. Thanks for

1050
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,320
that. Thanks for the help. No, you you

1051
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,160
hold on to that. I don't want it

1052
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,040
anymore. All right. First, I have ways

1053
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,320
to make it taste like something. And

1054
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,240
I'll come back to that in a second.

1055
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,480
First, it can help lower blood pressure.

1056
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,320
One small tea, rather one small study on

1057
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,839
this tea, hibiscus tea, showed that it

1058
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,240
actually lowered blood pressure in

1059
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,920
people who are at risk or had high blood

1060
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,680
pressure. So, that's pretty cool if it

1061
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,599
can help us with the number one killer

1062
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,680
of all of us. Next up, it can lower

1063
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,839
inflammation. The bright red color of

1064
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,680
this tea comes from anthocyanins and it

1065
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,040
has anti-inflammatory properties, those

1066
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,560
anthocyanins. So, that's why it has a

1067
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,079
benefit. Not to mention, it also has

1068
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,640
antioxidants by itself. And finally,

1069
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,040
it's got zero calories, right? No matter

1070
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,280
what it tastes like, hibiscus tea is

1071
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,359
free on calories. Now, I think it has

1072
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,960
lots of flavor, but it's light on the

1073
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,240
waistline. And there's no caffeine

1074
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,320
either, so you can drink it all day

1075
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,240
long. So, let's bring Talia back in.

1076
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,760
What is the best way to brew this tea to

1077
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,880
get it to become that refreshing iced

1078
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,200
tea that so many people are bragging

1079
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,560
about?

1080
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,160
Yeah. So, you can do it with the tea

1081
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,480
bags or you can do it with the loose

1082
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,320
dried tea petals, which I think is so

1083
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,320
much more fun and hands-on and like

1084
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,480
earthy. So, you're going to add half a

1085
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,040
cup of the loose into four cups of

1086
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,040
water.

1087
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,839
Let's do it. Let's just actually do it.

1088
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
I'm sorry.

1089
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,520
So sloppy, Talia.

1090
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,240
I'm sorry.

1091
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,480
Oh my goodness.

1092
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,599
Okay.

1093
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,200
We got a health expert.

1094
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,119
Hands I said hands on, you know, all

1095
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,560
hands on deck. So you're going to put

1096
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,200
that in your fridge.

1097
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,960
All right.

1098
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,119
And you're cold brewing it. So you let

1099
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,960
it sit there overnight and then in the

1100
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,000
morning you strain it out.

1101
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,000
It looks like this.

1102
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Voila.

1103
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,119
Let's see if it actually tastes

1104
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,240
questionable like our guest was.

1105
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,720
I think it's great.

1106
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,880
What are you talking about? It's fine.

1107
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,800
Oh my goodness. A lady in red. You're

1108
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,480
even dressed in hibiscus colors.

1109
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,760
It's kind of like cranberry.

1110
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,359
Little cranberry. Little little less

1111
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,280
tart though. So you don't have to put

1112
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,720
stuff in the color. I love cranberry

1113
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,839
juice, but do people do find that tart?

1114
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,280
So sometimes they have to add sugar.

1115
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,119
This you wouldn't have to add that too.

1116
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,960
It's got a calm soothing totally

1117
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,560
sensual taste to it. All right. Now Ty's

1118
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,000
got a couple of habiscus tea twists to

1119
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,079
share with everybody. How are you?

1120
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,400
This is Karen. She likes a little

1121
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,160
sweeter tea.

1122
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,800
So do you like Arnold Palmer's?

1123
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,000
Yes, I do.

1124
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,440
Have you had them? Yes.

1125
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,920
You know what they are?

1126
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,920
Yes. It's a delicious blend of uh

1127
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,520
lemonade and iced tea.

1128
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,520
Exactly. We could make our version

1129
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,800
hibiscus Palmer. Take it away, Talia.

1130
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,800
Yeah. I mean, everyone knows that the

1131
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,640
legendary golfer Arnold Palmer loved

1132
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:09,119
mixing lemonade and iced tea. Why not do

1133
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,599
iced habiscus tea instead? You still get

1134
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,839
half the calories of regular lemonade

1135
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,960
with the added benefits of the hibiscus

1136
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,160
tea.

1137
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,440
So, when you pour them, they don't

1138
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,520
separate. Even though we have pictures

1139
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,320
that show that they really should look

1140
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,640
this color.

1141
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,240
Yes.

1142
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,520
And then it gives you a little bit more

1143
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,200
sweetness here. Let's try this out.

1144
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,880
Take that to that discontented audience

1145
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,560
member over there.

1146
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,960
Maybe we could convince her that she

1147
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,560
actually do better with this habiscus

1148
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,119
palmer. You give it a taste. See what

1149
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,960
you think.

1150
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,720
Thank you.

1151
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,160
Don't ask too many details, Talia. She

1152
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,960
tends to she's sort of communely over

1153
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,280
there. Just a thumb up. Better better.

1154
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,160
All right.

1155
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,599
Better get a bucket.

1156
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,880
Fine. What do you think?

1157
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,599
That is delicious.

1158
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,400
It's great.

1159
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,400
Oh, it's fantastic.

1160
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,160
It actually lighten. It's already light,

1161
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,520
but it elevates that lightness so you

1162
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,079
have a little bit of a fuller mouth.

1163
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,200
It's great.

1164
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,119
It's really pretty, too.

1165
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,720
Very refreshing. I usually plant

1166
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,480
hibiscus. Now, I'm going to start

1167
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,400
drinking.

1168
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,280
It is literally those those leaves dried

1169
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,880
out, right?

1170
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,720
So, it's pretty simple. I can imagine

1171
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,119
like a regular tea. All right. Another

1172
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,560
super cool idea is a habiscus tea

1173
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,599
cocktail. This is really what you should

1174
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,800
be waiting for. you kick it up a notch.

1175
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,720
You can make us look, if you're going to

1176
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,280
make the hibiscus tea all day long, you

1177
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,960
can make this hibiscus drink all night

1178
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,040
long. So, share it with us.

1179
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,960
I love to party with this honey habiscus

1180
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,960
lime spritzer. So, all you do is you're

1181
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,320
going to brew it hot this time because

1182
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,920
you're going to add honey to it when

1183
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,839
it's hot and the honey will dissolve in

1184
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,000
the hot tea and but then you want to

1185
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,720
cool it. Once it's chill, you just add

1186
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,960
lime juice, tequila, seltzer, pour it

1187
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,520
over ice and cheers and party all night

1188
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,720
long.

1189
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,720
Let's just see here.

1190
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,079
It's really good.

1191
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,839
You know what? This is really something

1192
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,599
special. This is a great idea. We're

1193
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,960
going to put all these recipes on dr.com

1194
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,160
so you can take your summer drinks to

1195
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,760
next level. This I'm going to take you

1196
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,599
back with this lady again. See if I can

1197
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,440
little tequila might get her happier.

1198
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,280
We'll be right back. In the meantime,

1199
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,440
you want a little alcohol in yours?

1200
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,839
It's been 30 years since Ted Bundy's

1201
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,520
execution, but his bloodline lives on.

1202
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,599
He and his wife were able to have a

1203
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,040
daughter while Ted was on death Who is

1204
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,480
Ted Bundy's daughter?

1205
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,000
Imagine knowing that you're carrying

1206
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,280
these genes that you could potentially

1207
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,400
become a psychopath yourself.

1208
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,440
And where is she now?

1209
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,880
She changed her name.

1210
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,440
You tried to pretend it never happened.

1211
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,760
Plus, she survived Ted Bundy.

1212
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,680
I remember him asking me how I'd like to

1213
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,079
die. And he put his hands on my throat

1214
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,900
and started squeezing.

1215
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:37,440
That's coming up tomorrow.

1216
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:39,599
[Applause]

1217
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,920
The search for the next big health idea

1218
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,599
is on. I love working on new technology

1219
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,440
and tools to keep us all healthy. In

1220
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,920
fact, this past year I had the honor of

1221
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,160
working on two major developments in

1222
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,480
heart valves and one device is called

1223
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,160
the taver device. Those all the

1224
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,400
headlines and this device really cool.

1225
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,079
It goes up from the groin, right? Turns

1226
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,520
heart surgery into procedure of the past

1227
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,880
potentially. So instead of cracking open

1228
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,560
the chest, that little catheter goes in.

1229
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,680
So you expand it right there. That valve

1230
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,319
stuck in from the groin through a

1231
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,079
puncture. It up the the aortic valve

1232
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,920
that was stuck. And now you got a new

1233
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,920
valve placed over a catheter without

1234
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,079
having to open the chest without having

1235
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,119
to stop the heart.

1236
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,640
So, and now interestingly, I got another

1237
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,079
idea that just to highlight it for you.

1238
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,079
It's called a mitra clip, right? It

1239
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,640
looks like this. Opens up like that.

1240
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,560
Puts it across the mitro valve. It snaps

1241
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,839
shut like that and fixes the mitro valve

1242
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,079
that might be leaking. Reduces your

1243
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,680
chance of heart failure by a lot. These

1244
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,760
are huge advances. Now, both these

1245
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,000
inventions relied on teams of people

1246
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,119
working together for a long, long time.

1247
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,480
even if they don't have the same

1248
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,760
background or live in the same place.

1249
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,599
For example, with this clip that I just

1250
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,119
showed you, right? I work with a surgeon

1251
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,560
from a different part of the world and

1252
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,200
came up with an idea in the back of an

1253
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,359
envelope. Right? So, I want to help find

1254
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,960
the next big health idea. All kinds of

1255
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,960
ideas are out there. We're open to all

1256
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,880
of them. Remedies that you've been using

1257
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,960
