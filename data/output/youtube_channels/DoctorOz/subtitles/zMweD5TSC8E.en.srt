00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,319
My next guest is an undefeated boxing

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,200
world champion who learned the power of

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,360
giving back from the champ himself. Now,

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,040
Leila Ali is using what her dad taught

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,960
her to help improve the lives of

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,720
families in need of a fix with simple

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,560
home and food makeover hacks that you're

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,119
going to want to try.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,880
>> We are going to the kid family. They've

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,199
got this living room that needs a little

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,119
help.

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,760
>> It's beige on top of beige on top of

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,359
beige.

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,880
>> Cue the transformation team.

16
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
>> Tell me what you don't like about it. We

17
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,119
picked up the furniture at a garage

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
sale.

19
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,680
>> It was a curb sale. It wasn't even in

20
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,640
the garage.

21
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,000
>> Now, this makeover.

22
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,120
>> How you feeling about this? It looks

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,559
dangerous.

24
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,879
>> Will take major skills.

25
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,280
>> It's time to get the last pieces in

26
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,970
place

27
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,480
>> to pull off the ultimate surprise.

28
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,320
[Music]

29
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,620
>> Please welcome back to the show, Leila

30
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:57,530
Ali.

31
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:57,530
[Applause]

32
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,640
Oh my goodness.

33
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,719
>> How you doing?

34
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,760
>> Nice to see you. Are we working out

35
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,960
today? Working out.

36
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
>> We are working out. I will do everything

37
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,119
with you.

38
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,960
>> You usually make me work out when I go.

39
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,880
>> I adore having you. The walk from the

40
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,320
from the workout. Exactly.

41
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,360
>> I'm so proud that you're here and I'm so

42
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,240
proud of your new project.

43
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,920
>> Thank you. And I love to understand how

44
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,520
it carries on the legacy of your dad

45
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,720
because he really instilled in you this

46
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,680
powerful love, this need to help people

47
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,759
who are in need.

48
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
>> Yes. This show, Homemade Simple, gives

49
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,960
me the perfect opportunity to do the

50
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
things that I love. We're working with

51
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,600
families that are so deserving. We might

52
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,840
have someone that is um you know,

53
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,240
battling terminal illness or someone who

54
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,640
has um their own kids as a single mom

55
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,240
and took in foster kids. So, you

56
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,320
definitely want to give back to them and

57
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,079
I get to, you know, give them spaces

58
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
that are just as beautiful and inspiring

59
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
as they are and get in the kitchen and

60
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,840
cook with them.

61
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,159
>> Well, you've helped a lot of folks. You

62
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,840
rearrange their homes if they work in

63
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,360
their kitchen, which is a in itself a

64
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,119
pretty brave thing to do. And you've

65
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,280
been able to make some big-time changes

66
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,560
with with with simple moves. That's the

67
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,840
part that's coolest about it.

68
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,600
>> You know, it's when people are going

69
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,360
through a lot and they're stressed, they

70
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,080
the last thing they think about is, you

71
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,759
know, a relaxing master bedroom or a spa

72
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,879
retreat for themsel in their homes. And

73
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,560
then we just expanded into a plantbased

74
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,520
line of cleaning products.

75
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,440
>> I'm proud of you for that.

76
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,959
>> Got lemon, lavender, rosemary, which is

77
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,959
good for memory retention. So I know you

78
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,480
love. So just those small changes,

79
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,680
incorporating them into people's lives

80
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,319
and making them better just makes me

81
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
feel good.

82
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,920
>> Of all the people that you've helped,

83
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
who what problems have you knocked out

84
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,319
that you're proud of stuff? A family

85
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
that's most rewarding.

86
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,840
>> You know, one that really stands out is

87
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,319
a family that had a dad that lost his

88
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,239
arm to cancer about eight years ago. Mom

89
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,480
suffered from heart problems. They have

90
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,640
two children. Mom homeschools and they

91
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,319
have a small home, one big space, but

92
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,879
they do so much in it. She wants a place

93
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,040
to homeschool, a place to read, do art,

94
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,480
you know, living area. I'm like, how are

95
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,000
we going to get all this in one space?

96
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,519
We have such amazing designers and

97
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
carpenters and a whole team that we work

98
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,519
with and we actually got it done and it

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,560
of course destressed their lives and

100
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,920
they're so much happier now.

101
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
>> Well, it's something to behold. In fact,

102
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,360
here's an example of the room. We just

103
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,000
saw a glimpse of it before. This is the

104
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,319
pre-La Ali version, right? And let me

105
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,440
just show the audience what the room

106
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,879
what the first part of the room anyway

107
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
looked like right after Leila and her

108
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,480
team were done. You see the after there.

109
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,360
Walk us through what's what's different

110
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,200
there.

111
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
>> So I noticed you you you painted the

112
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,000
back wall different.

113
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,440
>> Yeah. So there's different angles of

114
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,360
that room. You're not seeing the whole

115
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,560
room. That was their entryway. But we

116
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,640
definitely had to create defined spaces.

117
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,200
So they when we left they had a living

118
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,879
area. They had their music area, their

119
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,560
reading area. So they were defined

120
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,280
compartmentalized. So to have

121
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,040
organization in your home does wonders

122
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,280
for for families.

123
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
>> So there's a couple if you're up for it

124
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
that I would like you to help us with.

125
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,959
>> Of course.

126
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,560
>> Similar to what kinds of cases you've

127
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,760
had. Maybe a bit more severe. You'll see

128
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,280
why. Come on over here.

129
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,799
>> Oh, severe. That's a scary word.

130
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
>> We got Belinda and Eric here.

131
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,239
>> Okay.

132
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
>> They're wonderful people.

133
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,200
>> Hi.

134
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,640
>> You guys look good.

135
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,840
>> How you doing?

136
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,040
>> Thank you. Thank you. May I

137
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,799
>> want your problem?

138
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,239
>> Exactly. She asked for this.

139
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,360
>> Right. So, here's the thing. They come

140
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,959
here and they say when it comes to

141
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,319
making decisions about the home, they

142
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,439
just can't seem to meet me in the middle

143
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
and they're starting to cause problems

144
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,159
in the relationship. And if you know

145
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,000
them like I do, there's not a lot of

146
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,680
middle here. You got two very strong,

147
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,680
intelligent people with with we're

148
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
opinionated. All right. So, Eric, you

149
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
you've been trying to work on this for a

150
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
while, right?

151
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,160
>> I have. I have. Absolutely. I have. Um

152
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,759
I'm a stylist as as well. So, to me,

153
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,199
life is all things beautiful.

154
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,280
>> You got a white palette. You got to

155
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,280
splash in color and make it bold. You

156
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,440
know, we live in an amazing space. We're

157
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
going to be buying a new home very soon.

158
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,160
And um as far as I'm concerned, if you

159
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,840
move into it, I don't care if you're

160
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
there for six months or a year. You want

161
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,960
to know that when you walk in, it's

162
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,040
exactly what you want. It's worth your

163
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,080
work for everything. But my precious

164
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,280
angel here. So you actually

165
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,479
look at this room behind you. One

166
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,000
second. You see that? Now that's the

167
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,759
warm-up, right? Before they've actually

168
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,960
moved, you got a little trial running.

169
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,320
Is that right, Eric? I did.

170
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,520
>> All right. So Linda, your honest

171
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,800
opinion, and you always are honest. What

172
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,040
do you think about Eric's work here?

173
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,080
>> Okay. I like it, but I think it's a bit

174
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:08,960
much for where we are. Uh, and also

175
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,960
color then the little picture frames and

176
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
something inside of the picture frame.

177
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,560
It's a bit much for me.

178
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,759
>> She being polite. She you do you like

179
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
it? Yes or no?

180
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,960
>> I don't like it for where we are. No.

181
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,360
>> Okay. So, this is the way it currently

182
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
is.

183
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,240
>> Yes, that's the way it it currently is.

184
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
>> Right. So, how common is before we get

185
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
into the specifics for a couple to have

186
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,240
very strong opinions, both know they're

187
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,360
right, and there's no place for at least

188
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,479
it seems like there's no place where you

189
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,759
could actually design together.

190
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,680
>> Well, first of all, Eric, you did a

191
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,080
really nice job and I can see you know

192
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
that you have you both have style. Okay,

193
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,039
I see that you have both have style. I

194
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
want to say thank

195
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,320
>> Eric patronizing you. Yes. Yes. I

196
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,080
appreciate that.

197
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,680
>> As we know in design, there's so many

198
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,199
different styles, right? So, it doesn't

199
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,720
mean just because you don't it's not

200
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,880
your style per se. Exactly. Doesn't mean

201
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
it's not nice. But you both live there.

202
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,280
So you mentioned white with splash

203
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,199
splashes of color. Like we have a white

204
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,800
canvas. We need splashes of color. But

205
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,960
there is no white here. And I actually

206
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,039
think that the design aesthetic really

207
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,800
pops more when you have a neutral tone.

208
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,560
Cuz one thing I do see is like I'm like

209
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,479
where am I looking? Because you know the

210
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,080
the the artwork is blending with the

211
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,360
wall and the furniture and then the

212
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,120
carpet. Where does it start? Where does

213
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,639
it end? You would have more contrast and

214
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,919
then you would get what you want

215
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,120
>> and you would still have your design.

216
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,880
And I think it would actually pop more

217
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,560
and then it'll have like a fresh look.

218
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,639
And a coat of paint is one of the first

219
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,639
things we do on the show on Homemade

220
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,560
Simple because it's such an easy,

221
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,440
inexpensive transformation and it's

222
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,319
instant.

223
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,520
>> I'm buying Eric a paintbrush.

224
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,039
>> Happy life. Happy life.

225
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,720
>> I hope that's helpful for you.

226
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,919
>> You're trying to figure it out. You see

227
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,800
what I'm saying? Working with me here.

228
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,479
>> I hear you. I hear you.

229
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
>> All right. Right. When we come back,

230
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,000
switching from home makeovers to food

231
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,280
makeovers was something all of you are

232
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,280
going to want to try for breakfast.

233
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,199
Stick around. We're back with Ali. Now

234
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,639
it's time to make over breakfast. Now

235
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,000
cooking has always been a big part of

236
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,440
Leila's life. She's been making

237
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
delicious meals for her family since she

238
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,639
was a kid. You little You were not not

239
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,039
at that young age.

240
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
>> Not at that young age. About 910 I've

241
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,759
been cooking. My mom didn't cook, so I

242
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
got in the kitchen early and learned. I

243
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,120
like to eat. Hey,

244
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,520
>> you did it right.

245
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,039
>> Yeah.

246
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,319
>> And today she has a breakfast using

247
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,759
leftovers. That's all you need.

248
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,199
Leftovers. They will keep you full all

249
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,720
day long. It's a quick meal that will

250
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
change the way you look at breakfast for

251
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,319
good. Eric and Blinda are back. They

252
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000
stopped fighting over that little room.

253
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,520
They're back to taste some breakfast.

254
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,520
When it when it comes to breakfast, you

255
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,800
guys get tired of the same old thing.

256
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,400
>> Yes, absolutely.

257
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
>> Yes, we do. Yeah, we eat the same thing

258
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
every morning.

259
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
>> Mix over the the meals, not the people.

260
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
That's what I say. So, all right. So,

261
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,039
what are you making today?

262
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,639
>> So, we are making breakfast pasta. Now,

263
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,840
my kids love pasta and they don't love

264
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
breakfast food. That's how I came up

265
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,479
with this idea. My daughter's like, I

266
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,840
want pasta. So, I was like, okay, how

267
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,280
can I make this healthy? Get some eggs

268
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,960
in it. You going to help me do this? I'm

269
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,080
going to show you. So, crack these eggs

270
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,880
for me.

271
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,560
>> Dr. O, my sue chef today. Okay,

272
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
>> so we're going to go ahead and just

273
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
>> How many do you need? just go ahead and

274
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,280
do like two or three. It doesn't matter.

275
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,199
Um it depends on what you like. So we're

276
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,840
going to go and put some oil in the pan.

277
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,840
We've got some precooked pasta here.

278
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,360
Now, everyone likes their pasta a

279
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,120
certain way, right? We've got whole

280
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
wheat. We got regular pasta, quinoa

281
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,319
pasta, all sorts of pasta. So if you're

282
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,680
gluten-free, you can still do pasta.

283
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,639
>> Yeah. You can pick your choice, right?

284
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,919
But you're making whole grain today.

285
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,400
>> We're using whole wheat. Yep.

286
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,919
>> Okay.

287
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,280
>> All right. So you can go ahead. Um let's

288
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,319
>> Oh my goodness. That's a lot of garlic.

289
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
>> It is. We're not going to put all that

290
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,879
in. We We like to season to taste.

291
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,360
Season to taste. Go ahead and mix those

292
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,039
up. So, you know, you can obviously can

293
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
boil this pasta, but I like to use I

294
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,720
always have pasta on hand. Like I said,

295
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,160
my kids love pasta. Okay, so we're just

296
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,120
going to go ahead and toss those in

297
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,319
>> without without spices.

298
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,160
>> I'm going to put the slices in next.

299
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,479
Yeah, there's no wrong way to do this.

300
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,879
It really ends up in the pan. So, I have

301
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,080
some turmeric here

302
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,519
cuz it's just good for you. I like to

303
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
just get good for your brain.

304
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
>> Yes. And then we have the pepper, right?

305
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,039
>> Yep.

306
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,560
>> And then I'm going to use depending on

307
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,760
how much do you like garlic?

308
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,800
>> I happen to love garlic. Got to go to

309
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,680
work usually after breakfast.

310
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,719
>> Oh, yeah. So, we'll just use a little

311
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,760
bit cuz I don't want anybody talking

312
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,480
about you. I don't want any

313
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,279
>> That's a little bit.

314
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
>> Yeah, that's a little bit.

315
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,839
>> Oh, jeez.

316
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,279
>> Don't worry. I got this. I got this. You

317
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,480
want to mix it? You like you're ready.

318
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,600
Go on and mix it up.

319
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,360
>> I tell I love breakfast foods that have

320
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,959
that have dinner components to them.

321
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,320
>> I like to eat what I love. So, whenever

322
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,600
it is, just eat the foods that you like

323
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
and make them as healthy as possible.

324
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,839
That's

325
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,519
>> I I used to pretty competitive

326
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,959
>> dairy. That's why I took this back over

327
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,959
cuz I saw you were taking over my dish

328
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,200
and I was like, "Hold on, Dr. Eyes. Hold

329
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,800
on. Come on over here, Eric. Come over.

330
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,760
Are you guys competitive?

331
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,040
>> Okay, we're going to play a little game

332
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,000
I play at my house. Grab one little

333
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,040
strand there.

334
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,160
>> And you grab one, Eric. Linda,

335
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,240
>> good. You guys ready?

336
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,000
>> Yes, we grab a really long one. All

337
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,600
right. Now, here's the deal. All you got

338
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
to do is slurp it up a You got You're

339
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,920
short. It's a lot shorter than mine. So,

340
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,120
I'm

341
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,320
>> All right. Let me see yours. You're the

342
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
one I carry. I'm going to beat you.

343
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440
>> No, I'm going to beat you. Are you

344
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,720
ready? Put your mouth, guys. Share your

345
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,720
side. Three, two, one.

346
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,809
[Applause]

347
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,920
You lost.

348
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,320
>> I lost. How did you even the ladies out

349
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
of the way?

350
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,560
>> Yeah. How' you do that?

351
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,880
>> Doc, do you have that on slow-mo? Is it

352
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,920
Where is he hiding?

353
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,600
Slow. Come over here. Oh my goodness.

354
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,080
>> Seriously, I can't stir up that fast.

355
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
>> I know.

356
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,160
>> You practice at home?

357
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
>> No, I didn't.

358
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,720
>> I might have cheated a little bit. I

359
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,080
think I just kind of used my fingers,

360
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,519
but it's okay. I just couldn't let you

361
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,000
win. I couldn't let you win.

362
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,279
>> Well, you won. You won. All right. So,

363
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
this is basic. They make it scrambled

364
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,399
eggs with some pasta in it.

365
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
>> Yes. So, basically this is done. Okay.

366
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,440
And what I love about this is you could

367
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,040
add vegetables. You can add whatever you

368
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
want to it. You know, make it your way.

369
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,440
Do like a pasta bar. But I have some

370
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,000
turkey, some meatball um that I we

371
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,040
pre-made here. But I love to do meatball

372
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,399
turkeys.

373
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,079
>> I'm sorry, I said meatball turkey.

374
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,600
Turkey meatball.

375
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,480
>> They comes in both forms.

376
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
>> Yes, exactly.

377
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
>> And you put a couple in here.

378
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,240
>> And these again, these could be from

379
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
last night.

380
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
>> Yeah. And we already have um some for us

381
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,640
to taste. I'm just showing you how you

382
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
put taste that. Let's see what you guys

383
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,000
think.

384
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,760
>> Very good.

385
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,120
>> And here's one for you and one for me.

386
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
>> Are the kids usually happy eating this?

387
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,519
That's the question.

388
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,959
>> They are. I wouldn't put too too don't

389
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,839
want to put the herbs on for my kids or

390
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,880
they would eat it. Yeah.

391
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,240
>> You don't want them to see that?

392
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,399
>> No, definitely not.

393
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,519
>> Belinda slurper. Miss the slurper

394
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,920
champion of the world. What do you

395
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,440
think?

396
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,320
>> This is delicious. Very good.

397
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,399
>> Go like it. Eric, you happy?

398
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,839
>> I tell you what, in my home I, you know,

399
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,200
this is a design question. I think

400
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,720
everyone ought to focus their lives

401
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,079
around their kitchen, eating the right

402
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
foods, but it also is where communities

403
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,800
always happen.

404
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
>> Oh, yeah. that my my kitchen is my happy

405
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,920
place and my and my family room is right

406
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,959
off the kitchen because then my family

407
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
knows I'm going to be in the kitchen so

408
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,320
you better want to be you want to be

409
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,440
close to me.

410
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,800
>> Well, I'll make it the first room you

411
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
make over when you come to my house. God

412
