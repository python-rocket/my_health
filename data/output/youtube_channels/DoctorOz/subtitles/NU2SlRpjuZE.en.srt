1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,120
Working in hospitals, I've seen a lot of

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,600
things that will shock you. But I'm

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,240
always amazed at what can get stuck in

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,400
the human body. Today, the extreme

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,920
X-rays that you have to see to believe.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm about to show you the craziest

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,960
objects you'd never expect to see in the

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,680
human body. They're going to make you

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,000
wonder how did that get in there? For

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,000
example, see this little cartoon toy?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
You recognize it, right? You can see the

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,960
exact outline, the eyes, little smile,

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,400
right? You can see it so clearly. So

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,559
lots more things like this are in your

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,239
body sometimes and here to break it down

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,960
for us is gastroenterenterologist Dr.

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,480
Rashini Raj. Thanks for being here. You

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,160
brought examples of the kinds of things

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,440
that you find and sometimes have to

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,719
remove from the human body. That's

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,559
right. And we're talking here about

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
things particularly children in general

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,360
tend to swallow. They they just get

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,680
their hands on everything. They love to

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,280
put things in their mouth. We see coins,

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,360
these button batteries. These can

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
actually be very dangerous if swallowed.

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,079
pen caps, doll heads, those little

29
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,760
action figures, little doll accessories.

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,520
I have I have soldiers like this at

31
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,039
home. Yeah, I know. I do, too. I have

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,479
two boys. So, you have to be very

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,080
careful with children. Really try to

34
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,360
monitor them and don't have loose things

35
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,799
like this around where they could put

36
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,000
them in their mouth. Not just kids as

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,960
adults, too. For example, these little

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
pain caps. How many of you guys are

39
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,240
always chewing on them like this? I

40
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,880
know. Chewing chewing like that. Bad

41
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,119
idea. Don't Don't do that cuz you can

42
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,479
swallow it. However, all that stated,

43
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,479
are they really a problem? Let's go

44
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,320
through our X-ray Hall of Fame to show

45
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,680
things that are more of a concern. First

46
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,439
off, this image you're I don't think

47
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,320
ever going to be able to forget. I know

48
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,079
it's a safety pin. I have no idea how it

49
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
got stuck up in someone's nose. Please

50
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,119
outline it for everybody. Okay. So,

51
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,400
right here you see the safety pin.

52
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,240
Here's the head. And here's the sharp

53
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,159
edge to it. Now, this was just a

54
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,159
10-year-old girl who was using a safety

55
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,640
pin to kind of clean her nose as kids

56
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,560
tend to do sometimes. And unfortunately,

57
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,880
she kind of lost control of it. It got

58
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
lodged in her sinuses and it took

59
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
several hours to get out. Oh my

60
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,720
goodness. That would have been a

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,960
challenge. Yes. Okay. Correct. Next

62
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,320
image. Check this out. This is a nail.

63
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,280
That's right. It's a nail. The kind you

64
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,880
put in wood. And it's not juxaposed.

65
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,520
That's literally through the pallet of

66
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,280
his mouth up into the be towards the

67
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,280
eyeball. Yeah. I mean, when it comes to

68
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,479
jarring x-rays, I think this one hits

69
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,000
the nail on the head, as we say. Sorry,

70
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,440
I couldn't resist. She'll be here all

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,879
week. Try the corn beef. Anyway, this

72
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,680
was a young man who was working in

73
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,440
construction and his nail gun actually

74
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,920
misfired. The crazy thing about it is he

75
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,080
did not realize this nail was lodged in

76
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,480
his mouth actually here in his hard

77
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,920
pallet. Didn't really put two and two

78
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,680
together until he had this nagging

79
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,959
toothache. Went to the doctor. This is

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
what the X-ray found. Can you imagine

81
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
the dentist getting the image? I know.

82
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
And how lucky was this young man that it

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
didn't go somewhere crucial in his brain

84
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,840
that this is where what happened? He was

85
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,239
actually fine after. They use a hammer

86
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
to pull it out to How do you do that? I

87
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,440
don't I'm not exact. I think it was more

88
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
of a tool to take it out. Yeah. All

89
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,319
right. In this image, look carefully

90
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,920
here. You all see the pen the pen in the

91
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,840
belly.

92
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,519
Yeah. So, this is pretty dramatic as

93
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,040
well. And this was a woman who was

94
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,879
examining her tonsils. Maybe she had a

95
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,120
sore throat using a pen as a kind of

96
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,440
tongue depressor. Lost control of it.

97
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
Accidentally swallowed it. She knew she

98
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,120
swallowed it, but she went to get an

99
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,640
X-ray the next day. Because the pen was

100
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,599
plastic, it didn't show up on a regular

101
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,239
X-ray. 25 years later, she ended up

102
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,480
getting a CAT scan. 25 years. And this

103
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,599
pen was still there in her intestine,

104
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
believe it or not. Now, I know what

105
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,519
you're all asking. You're all thinking,

106
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,400
"Does this still work?" Right? That's

107
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,560
the question on everyone's mind. So,

108
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,599
crazily, look at this. Not only did it

109
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,080
work, that's the actual lettering made

110
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,480
by that pen after 25 years in her belly.

111
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,720
Yeah, it was a felt pen. That's a

112
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,120
company you want to be involved with.

113
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,959
Next up, this shiny little object. I see

114
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,840
it on the X-ray. See it there? It's a

115
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,680
diamond earring. Right now, everyone's

116
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,760
lost an earring before, right? But check

117
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,519
out what happened when McKenzie realized

118
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:57,080
her lost earring was in her infant son.

119
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,920
So Bennett swallowed an

120
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,599
earring, but he was playing and I look

121
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,720
over and he has something in his mouth.

122
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,840
And I'm like, "Oh my gosh, what did you

123
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,680
just eat?" So I'm like trying to scoop

124
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,519
it out. Then I look over on the

125
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,640
nightstand to see what he could have

126
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:16,720
eaten. and saw one earring. There it is,

127
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,280
you guys. Here's my earring.

128
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,240
It sure is. McKenzie and her son Bennett

129
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,320
join us now. McKenzie, how did you get

130
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,840
the earring out? What did doctors tell

131
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,440
you?

132
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,919
They said to wait it out. Yeah. Um, and

133
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,639
I had the fun task of checking his

134
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,720
diapers and finally after two days

135
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:41,199
discovering the earring. Oh, he passed

136
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,199
it. Yes. Daddy. Yes. Yes. No, I'm not

137
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,720
daddy. That's that's that's that's not

138
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,440
right.

139
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,800
Mommy. Yes. Well, he's

140
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,400
obviously very active. So, where is that

141
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,440
earring now? Do you wear it to remember

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,080
the the the event?

143
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,759
Yes. The earring. As happy as I was to

144
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,880
see the earring, I was just as happy to

145
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,880
throw it away because it was disgusting.

146
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,919
Thank you for sharing your story. God

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,520
bless you both. Say thank you. Bye. Bye.

148
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,600
Bye. Oh, he's so cute. So cute.

149
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,440
Up next, just how long should it take

150
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,840
for a swallowed object like a diamond

151
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,759
earring to pass? The extreme experiment

152
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,840
scientists did to find out the answer

153
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
for

154
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,680
you. We're back with Dr. Raj taking a

155
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,440
look at some extreme X-rays. Now, we've

156
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,039
been investigating how the heck some

157
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
things get stuck in the human body, and

158
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,600
now we're going to find out how long it

159
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,840
takes for something to well come back

160
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,280
out. Now, as a grandfather, I'm always

161
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,520
afraid of my grandkids getting some of

162
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,080
these beautiful toys, right? Then they

163
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,840
swallow one of these like the head here,

164
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,280
right? And all of a sudden, you've got

165
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,960
to figure out what to do about it. So,

166
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
one of the questions we always ask is

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,840
how long will it take to come out? So,

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,600
Dr. Raj, there was an experiment that

169
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,680
pediatricians did. That's right. To try

170
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
to figure out exactly the answer. Yeah.

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,199
They were from the UK and Australia and

172
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,280
they actually swallowed these exact type

173
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
of toys and then they measured how long

174
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
it would take. They did X-rays to really

175
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,160
monitor how long it would pass through

176
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,440
their system. Right. So there's the

177
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,440
actual illust. Imagine doctors doing

178
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,360
this. By the way, the little pictures of

179
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,319
the head and the measurements and they

180
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,560
got all kinds of curves and results. So

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,400
let's just play it through and to reveal

182
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,919
what they were showing to us. So let's

183
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
say

184
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,600
you're looking inside of me. All right.

185
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,880
There I am. Got to muster today, don't

186
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,120
I? All right. And let's say I take this

187
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,360
little plastic toy head. Don't try this

188
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
at

189
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,840
home. All right. It's down. Now, first

190
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,759
off, you're going to see it. There it

191
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,960
is, right in the my esophagus. Now,

192
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,560
hopefully it doesn't stay in my

193
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,080
esophagus too long. This is actually a

194
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,919
very dangerous place cuz, for example,

195
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,319
those batteries, they can do some real

196
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,600
damage to the thin wall of the

197
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,039
esophagus. And things like chicken bones

198
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,560
can get stuck in here and really hurt

199
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,400
and that can cause problems. But if

200
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
you're lucky, and most people are, and

201
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,960
it goes through that swallowing tube,

202
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,160
which doesn't take very much time, boom,

203
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,319
it's in your stomach. Now, what do you

204
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
do? Talk this through. Okay. So, like

205
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,120
you said, it went through the esophagus.

206
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,120
Thank goodness it's now in the stomach.

207
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,360
You have the digestive enzymes there,

208
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,000
the acid of your stomach working on this

209
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,000
object, but it will eventually pass from

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,240
the stomach into here we are now in your

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
small intestine. Lots of feet to go

212
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,160
through here. It almost looks like a

213
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,599
video game, but as it's passing through,

214
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,599
usually if it's soft and it doesn't have

215
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,520
any like jagged edges, it won't do too

216
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,880
much damage. And finally, we get to the

217
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
end of the journey, your large

218
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,199
intestine, also known as your colon. And

219
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,639
here we are on our way out. That feels

220
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,599
good. That feels so good.

221
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,599
So

222
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,360
we accelerated that a little bit, but

223
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,800
they actually wanted to figure out the

224
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,199
answer to the question we started with.

225
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,919
So they created something called a fart

226
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,680
score. It's not what you think. These

227
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,000
are real doctors actually making this

228
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,440
up. It is the mind and retrieval time.

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,120
So how long does it take for these

230
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,960
objects to pass through? Yeah, I mean

231
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,199
it's a pretty clever idea, right? So

232
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,639
what was the fort score for one of those

233
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,000
tiny little toys that I just swallowed?

234
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,080
When When's it coming out of me? It's

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,080
coming out in 1 to two days. Not too

236
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,759
long, actually. Oh, that's good. And

237
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,240
what should we do if a child or loved

238
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,400
one swallows a toy head or something a

239
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
bit more concerning a foreign object?

240
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,080
Well, it's very important. You can't be

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,319
too careful in this situation. Call your

242
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,000
doctor. All right. So, like so many

243
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,319
things, like everybody, this too shall

244
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
pass. Dr. Raj, wonderful advice. The

245
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,080
other changes happening. Our journey is

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,680
just beginning. Thank you for watching.
