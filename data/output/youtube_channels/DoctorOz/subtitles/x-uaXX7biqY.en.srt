1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,960
You know our best for making you laugh

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,920
and cry in her Emmy nominated role as

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,480
Kate Pearson on NBC's IT show This Is

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,719
Us. Now Chrissy Mets has taken on

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,199
another inspiring and emotional role in

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,720
the upcoming film Breakthrough. And in

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,800
her real life, she has several

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,720
breakthroughs of her own. I'm excited to

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,039
welcome my next guest, Chrissy Betts.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,039
Come on out.

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,760
I finally finally How are you? How are

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,079
you? Oh my goodness. It's been like

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,640
years in the making, right? It has a lot

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,399
of effort. Yeah, I know. I'm so happy.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
Thank you for your patience. I've had a

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,280
busy girl. Yeah, you have been busy.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,039
Gratefully, actually, since picking

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,719
busy, everyone was stunned watching the

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,320
season finale of This Is Us. I know,

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,480
right? So, we see you, your character

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,160
Kate gives birth to a 28-week old child,

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,680
which is a a risky time to give birth to

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,039
a child. One of our children was born

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,359
early, so I, you know, lived it a little

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,119
bit. And, uh, then we have, you have to

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,520
fast forward in the show, and I see the

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,159
baby's okay. Yeah. I see Toby, your

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,119
husband, in the in the show is around,

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,799
although he's not wearing a wedding

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,720
ring. That's what people notice. Yes.

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
And where you your your character is not

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,159
there. What happened? Who she could be

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,520
at the dry cleaner? Who knows? When When

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,799
did she die?

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,000
What are you a writer on the show? Do

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,600
you want to be a writer on the show?

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,600
That's the thing is what's so beautiful

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
about this is us and the writers is that

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,119
because it's not linear, we can sort of

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,600
take you everywhere and we want to go

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,840
everywhere, right? So, um, we'll find

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,280
we'll find answers in in season 4, but

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
and I do know what's happening just in

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,159
case you want to know, but I'm not going

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,680
to tell you because you you don't want

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,040
to open up the present too soon, right?

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,640
You want to just you want to I won't

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,920
open the present. I know. I You might

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
want to just give me the I'm a doctor.

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
Give me the diagnosis she has. Don't

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,399
worry about it. Don't Don't stress

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,439
yourself. Just enjoy it. So, I actually

53
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,799
knew I was going to love you because I

54
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,880
did what's watch what's happening live

55
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,159
with your co-star Toby. His real name is

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,560
Chris Sullivan, as you know. He's the

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,119
best. He He adores you. Hilarious guy,

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,960
by the way. Beyond. And it told me a lot

59
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,560
about the behind the set events, the

60
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,319
shenanigans that goes on that keeps you

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,280
guys so energized. Well, that's him. He

62
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,480
is Mr. Shenanigan. Like honestly I I you

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,760
know we're in these like really heavy

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,680
emotional scenes and then he's like

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,360
cracking jokes you know in between and

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,920
it helps like we need some levity of

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,840
course but yeah he's always doing humor

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
it works. So let me brag on Chrissy. She

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,080
just had her first live televised

70
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,360
performance at the ACM alongside lots of

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,400
powerhouse singers including Carrie

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,959
Andrew. There she is. She was singing

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
her song from Breakthrough. What was it

74
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,959
like being on stage all I mean all of

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,519
America's watching you? Yeah. And it's

76
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,879
about a really beautiful song from a

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,360
movie we'll speak about in a second.

78
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,040
Yeah. I mean, it was so, you know, I'm a

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,720
little I'm a girl from a little small

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
town in Florida and, you know, you sort

81
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,519
of dream about these things happening,

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,440
but you don't ever know if it's going to

83
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
really happen. And to be on the stage

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
with these incredible artists who I've

85
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,920
revered for quite some time and I love.

86
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,400
I was like, this this is a a moment and

87
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,480
a a moment for women uh women in country

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
music and it was Yeah, it was pretty

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,760
incredible. It was special. You're

90
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,519
wonderful. Thanks. I am curious how you

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,000
deal with all the emotions. This great

92
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,599
movie breakthrough, it's it's riveting,

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,239
but it is it's up and down emotionally

94
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,480
for you so so it can work for us. Yeah.

95
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,400
The the depth that you have to pull from

96
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,760
that well. Yeah. Has involved members of

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
your family. I know your mom had been

98
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,640
ill for a while. Yes. My mom had a

99
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,480
stroke um two years ago now. Um but

100
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,319
physically she's doing better than she's

101
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,640
ever done before. So it's wonderful. But

102
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,840
I understand the the fear. Yeah. when

103
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,440
she had the stroke. Oh yeah. Helped you

104
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,440
identify a bit more with the characters

105
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,400
in Breakthrough. Maybe catalyze your

106
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,640
decision to move forward with the

107
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,920
project. Absolutely. Um almost verbatim

108
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
were the words that I said to my

109
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,720
mother's doctors. I said, "You can give

110
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,080
a diagnosis and I know you're you

111
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,040
practice. You're a doctor. You don't

112
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,879
always know and you don't always have

113
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,400
the answers. You don't know my mom, but

114
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,560
we have to only speak positive thoughts

115
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,040
around her." And Joyce said those exact

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,439
same things to her son John's doctors.

117
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,799
And I thought this is no coincidence,

118
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,480
you know, at all. So, so this is me, New

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,400
York Times bestseller. I had the

120
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,879
paperback finally. Yeah. Hard to find a

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,840
hardback these days.

122
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,079
Famously, you comment that you had 81

123
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,639
cents in the bank when they told you to

124
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,320
audition for This Is Us. Yeah. Yeah. I

125
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,479
needed to borrow gas money to get to the

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,600
audition.

127
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,440
That's funny now. But um Yeah. uh you

128
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,520
know, but uh yeah, I mean 12 years in

129
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,800
the making of trying to aspire to be an

130
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,960
actress and you know uh it's pretty

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199
incredible. I mean yeah. So have you

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,720
changed since you got the break because

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,160
there are lots of people who are still

134
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,440
running around with 81 cents in the

135
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,720
bank. Sure. Looking for your cab fair or

136
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,919
gas money, but they're not getting the

137
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,919
role. Yeah. And I I have to just for me

138
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,440
it was never about oh I want fame and

139
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,280
fortune. It was like I want to relate to

140
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,919
people. I want people to relate to me

141
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,840
and um I think that's so much about what

142
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,520
we do is intention and those were always

143
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,120
my intentions. So So have those

144
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,600
intentions stayed the same because

145
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,840
they're temptations to alter. Sure. I

146
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,479
mean as we do and evolve sometimes for

147
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
better or worse sometimes. Uh and of

148
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,600
course in this industry it's it's

149
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,360
challenging. You know you're sort of

150
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,120
treated a certain way and I and I always

151
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,280
have to remind myself that like we're

152
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,919
all the same. Like I am the same as

153
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,360
every single person on watching and in

154
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,479
this audience. It's like I just have a

155
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,680
different job. So, hallelujah. Yeah. So,

156
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,440
I understand you are blessed to have a

157
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,600
shared meal with my mentor Oprah. I

158
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,800
know. Was that cute? She's the best. And

159
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,680
she apparently said something to you

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,120
that I I've heard uh from her in the

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,039
past, which is you should be proud of

162
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,639
what you've done in your life. Sure. Too

163
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,160
often we sort of distance ourselves.

164
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,759
What What happened? I mean, she she's

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
not apologetic about anything because

166
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,680
she does exactly what she needs to do.

167
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,440
Also, because she works so hard for it.

168
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,639
So, I walked into her home and of course

169
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,720
I'm like, "What is this place?" And I

170
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,120
said, "Wow, your home is so beautiful."

171
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,960
And she said, "I know. Thank you." And

172
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,479
and people you you're sort of like,

173
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,120
"What?" Because we're taught to sort of

174
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,199
deflect and oh, this dress was on sale.

175
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,639
Instead of just saying thank you or just

176
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,560
owning that moment and saying, "Yeah, I

177
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
worked really hard for this." And that's

178
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,759
what she did. And it was like I was

179
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,520
there for two seconds.

180
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,280
Oprah Winfrey, folks. There she is.

181
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,680
There she is.

182
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,560
I'm grateful to her and I think about

183
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,360
her a lot when I have

184
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,800
breakthroughs sitting here on the show

185
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,039
and talk to guests because the ideas

186
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
came from her. Sure. The wisdom of how

187
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
to let a guest tell their story. Right.

188
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,400
You practice gratitude. Who do you look

189
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,039
to? What what what what ideas come to

190
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
your mind? For me, I start gratitude the

191
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,759
first thing in the morning before I even

192
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,759
put my feet on the floor. When I get out

193
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,360
of bed, I at least 10 things that I'm

194
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,919
grateful for. You write them down. You

195
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,759
say I just say them out loud. Um, you

196
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,680
know, I for me it just sort of centers

197
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,120
me and starts the day in a positive way.

198
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,880
So, what are you grateful this morning?

199
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
Oh my goodness. That I woke up, that I'm

200
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,479
mobile, that I'm healthy, you know, that

201
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,400
I have incredible people that love me

202
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,080
and support me and who are making all of

203
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,919
these these wonderful things in my life

204
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,440
happen. Like there's I mean, we could

205
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,280
spend an hour on gratitude. We could,

206
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,319
but we don't. But we don't. We don't. We

207
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,080
spend a lot of time on the

208
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,440
anti-gratitude issues. Speaking of

209
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,639
gratitude, Chrissy stars in this new

210
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,400
movie I've been alluding to called

211
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,960
Breakthrough, which is based on an

212
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,520
incredible true story with a big health

213
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,759
element to it. She plays a mother whose

214
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,960
son fell through a frozen lake, drowned.

215
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
When I say drowned, like literally

216
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,199
drowned. Yeah. Heart stopped beating for

217
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,120
45 minutes. And what happened next is

218
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,720
very difficult to explain with science.

219
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,479
As a doctor, I can tell you I have no

220
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,479
idea how this happened. But you might be

221
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,280
able to explain it with prayer. Take a

222
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,360
look at this.

223
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,800
do you get the goosebumps we get when

224
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
you watch that? You know, I don't know

225
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,319
if it's goosebumps as much as it's like,

226
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
wow, that's what I have to remind myself

227
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,000
to do every day, just surrender. And

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,639
it's tricky. It's really tricky to do,

229
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,319
but also because the story is so moving

230
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,880
that finally when she surrendered and

231
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,160
she trusted, that's when the miracle

232
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,680
happened, you know. So, when you were

233
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,199
with your mom and in the darkest

234
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,759
moments, is that what you were saying to

235
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,280
yourself? Oh, sure. you know, you pray,

236
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,440
you know, you storm the heavens with

237
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,960
your prayers and then you just you have

238
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,479
to let go and let God for me. Um I I

239
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,280
there's nothing else that you can do at

240
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,639
that point. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. When

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,080
we come back, Devon Franklin, our

242
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,440
friend, is here. He's a faith leader,

243
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,440
comes on the show a lot, and he happens

244
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
to be the producer of Chrissy's new

245
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,960
movie. The little clip you just saw, the

246
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,720
real life medical miracle that inspired

247
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,680
this film is next. So stay with us. You

248
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,080
know, I love I love how emotional you

249
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,160
guys are watching the movie because, you

250
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,680
know, this is a true story. Yeah. You

251
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,360
know, that that we're obviously invested

252
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,880
in and it's still unbelievable for me.

253
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,959
And there was I mean, seriously, Dennis

254
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,560
and Josh and Chrissy are so good in that

255
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,120
moment. Every time I watch it, I'm like,

256
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,720
he's not going to make it.

257
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,120
We were in it. You don't know the

258
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,640
ending. There's a clip from Chrissy Mets

259
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,080
in the new film Breakthrough about a

260
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,839
mother's belief in the power of prayer

261
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
to heal her son against all odds.

262
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,720
because he's back with the film's

263
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,959
producer, faith leader, a very good

264
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,720
friend of mine, Devon Franklin. So, I

265
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,040
appreciate the fact that you're

266
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,480
experiencing it with us. By the way, how

267
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,640
is making this movie Breakthrough

268
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,880
different from making This Is Us. You

269
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,200
know, I think it's the turnaround time

270
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,720
was a little longer. We shot it in 32

271
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,959
days. You know, Kate, I've been

272
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,560
cultivating for 30 seasons, so it's a

273
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,240
little different. Um, you haven't been

274
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,640
public as at least I haven't seen you as

275
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,000
public about your faith as uh as has

276
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,839
become evident watching this movie and

277
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,640
hearing you speak about it. How how has

278
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,120
faith informed your life? Oh my

279
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,560
goodness. Faith has always been such a

280
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,560
cornerstone if not like the most

281
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,920
important thing in my life. I mean I as

282
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,600
I talk about in my book and we sort of

283
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,600
touched on is that I had a pretty

284
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,160
tumultuous childhood. I mean all of us

285
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,519
it's all relative but um I mean I would

286
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,519
go to church on my own you know because

287
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,399
I was seeking that connection and that

288
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,519
conscious contact with God and um always

289
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,200
looking for that and and luckily and and

290
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,480
gratefully I I have that and I found

291
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
that and that's how I navigated

292
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,880
Hollywood. But what kind of a problem as

293
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,640
a child would you have where you'd find

294
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,800
solace in church? Uh, you know, my my

295
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,399
parents divorced and my mom remarried

296
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,320
and then I became the middle child. And

297
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,560
so, like navigating that through puberty

298
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,360
with a stepfather, God, you know, all of

299
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,760
those things were like, huh, what do I

300
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,040
do? And and just feeling inadequate, you

301
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
know, as we do, especially through

302
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,800
puberty, like my goodness. Um, so yeah,

303
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,040
you know, life, yeah, life comes in

304
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,160
handy. Have some faith. You're one of

305
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,800
the most powerful people in Hollywood.

306
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,480
you're very uh you know polite about and

307
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,760
humble about it, but you are you

308
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,959
attracted some superstars to this movie,

309
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,640
but you had to get attracted to it

310
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,240
first. Why? Well, I was promoting

311
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,600
Miracles from Heaven, um one of the

312
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,920
films I produced. And when I was

313
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,320
promoting that film, I met Pastor Jason

314
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,079
John and Joyce Smith. And when Joyce

315
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,560
talked about going in that emergency

316
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,800
room and praying her son John back to

317
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,720
life, I said, "I've got to tell this

318
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,640
because it motivated me then and it

319
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,480
still motivates me now." And I felt like

320
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,120
this is the type of story that people

321
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
really want to hear more about.

322
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,040
For years, we've watched this guy

323
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,200
inspire America, finding films to just

324
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,959
touch our chords, just play their play

325
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,920
our chords in a special way. How has he

326
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,880
inspired you? I Okay, first of all, I I

327
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,959
don't even know how he wakes up at the

328
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
gym for at 4:00 in the morning and and

329
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,040
like before he even I makes me mad

330
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,839
actually. Stop it. Angry, jealous. I was

331
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,160
going to say that, but I was like,

332
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,279
that's not kind. Um, but just the

333
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,120
motivation and his consistency. Um, and

334
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,640
what's really wonderful is that not only

335
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,519
has he become like a brother to me, but

336
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,120
a friend and like so much of the

337
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,920
guidance I never knew that I needed, but

338
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,440
like I found in in you and I'm just so

339
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,680
grateful. I mean, just the way that he

340
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
lives his life is so inspiring. Well,

341
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,279
it's it's the ethics. You go back to

342
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,279
where my skin is. It's true though. It's

343
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,680
so true. And speaking of the ethics of

344
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,040
making a movie, you you felt you felt

345
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,120
you thought it was very important to get

346
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,640
the family on board before you move

347
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,079
forward. Yes. You know, I mean, for

348
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
Chrissy and I, no matter how much we

349
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,760
love Breakthrough, this is a movie for

350
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,160
us, but for the family, this is their

351
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,680
life, and it's so important to get it

352
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,959
right. And so, the family was involved

353
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,959
during the development of the script,

354
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,959
they came to set, uh, you know, met

355
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,320
Chrissy, met all the other actors, we

356
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,240
screened the film for them, they love

357
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
it. So, the family saying that we got it

358
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,839
right is so important. It means

359
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,959
everything to us. Oh, yeah. Well, you

360
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,200
got it right. When we come back, you're

361
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,880
gonna get to meet John. The film's real

362
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,399
life medical miracle. I still am

363
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,079
curious. I don't understand how he's

364
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,639
able to even walk and talk, but can do

365
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,000
much more. Stay with us. As doctors, we

366
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,920
believe in science, of course, but

367
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
science doesn't always have the answer.

368
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,160
Sometimes there are things called

369
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,880
medical miracles. John Smith was just 14

370
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,560
years old when he drowned in a frozen

371
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,480
lake. Yeah, she drowned. And according

372
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,880
to attending physicians, and they quote,

373
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,639
I'm quoting them, he was dead for 45

374
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,720
minutes, which meant his heart had

375
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,720
stopped. His story is the inspiration

376
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,079
for the new film Breakthrough. Despite

377
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,839
all that, John is actually sitting next

378
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,440
to me. He's here along with Pastor Jason

379
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,519
Noble. Back also is the film star

380
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,920
Chrissy Mets who plays John's mom and

381
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,079
the film producer Devon Franklin. I got

382
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,279
to say I I I only saw the movie version

383
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,399
of it because there was no one filming

384
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,279
you when you actually fell into the

385
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,360
lake. But what happened? What

386
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,200
what when the ice gave way under you,

387
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,320
what did you think? You know, you're

388
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,839
just fighting for your life at that

389
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,600
point. Um it's that fight orflight

390
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,839
instinct that everyone has. And at that

391
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,120
point it was it was very scary, don't

392
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,399
get me wrong, but we knew that we

393
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
couldn't get back because there was so

394
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,920
much ice between us and the dock. We

395
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,600
were 25 to 50 ft out. So there was no

396
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,040
way we could get back. So at that point

397
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,240
we were just trying doing the best we

398
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,079
can, but we knew that we were staring

399
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,920
death in the face. Your two friends fell

400
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,160
in after you and they were able to get

401
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,680
pulled out. You went under and what did

402
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,160
you experience when you were under the

403
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,000
dark water with only ice above you? You

404
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,320
know, for me it was just I could

405
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,040
understand how dirty the water was. It

406
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,959
was a greenish brown just disgusting

407
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,639
moss and then after that I really don't

408
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,800
remember anything just it being very

409
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,800
cold and the hypothermia setting in.

410
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,279
Patients of mine I'm a heart surgeon so

411
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,040
sometimes during the cases people have

412
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,440
problems with their heart and they'll

413
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,360
have out-of- body experiences. Did you

414
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,800
you have any recollection of what

415
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,160
happened when you lost consciousness?

416
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,320
Did you feel like you were leaving your

417
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,320
body? No sir. Because we believe that

418
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,320
breakthrough is about a family. I mean

419
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
from Devon, from Chrissy, from Jason,

420
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,279
all of us. Breakthrough is about a

421
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,320
family event more than a if because if

422
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,320
that would have happened to me, it would

423
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,399
have been it would have been about my

424
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,040
own experience. Breakthrough is about

425
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,360
family and community. So in the film,

426
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,839
John lay lifeless without a pulse.

427
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Doctors gave no chance of survival, no

428
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,279
chance. And then his mother prayed to

429
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,079
God to breathe life into his body. And

430
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,320
then moments later, John somehow came

431
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,760
back, somehow woke up. Have you ever

432
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,800
experienced something like that, Chris,

433
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,959
in your life?

434
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,279
How have you seen prayer play a role in

435
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,600
your day-to-day life? Oh, through

436
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,519
everything everything you know I do and

437
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,199
before I either make a decision or

438
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,600
whilst something is happening I'm like

439
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,600
okay please just be with me. I mean

440
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,279
literally to the performance the other

441
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,800
night on Sunday um there were some

442
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,480
technical difficulties and I thought

443
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,680
okay it's going to be what it's going to

444
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,959
be. I'm just going to surrender and

445
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,959
trust and uh thy will not mine be done.

446
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,360
Cuz you were very calm during that.

447
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,959
That's what That's what they say. That's

448
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
what they say. Yeah. When your mom had

449
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,680
her stroke, did you did you did you have

450
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,079
a moment where you felt you needed to

451
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,240
pray like this? Oh, sure. I mean,

452
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,079
constantly. And um Yeah. I mean, yeah.

453
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,800
All the time. And we sort of just sat

454
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,240
around her her bedside. And that's what

455
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,519
I said, like only positive thoughts and

456
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,600
only positive prayers. And like if you

457
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,079
have nothing good to say, then you can

458
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,360
you can step out of the realm. Um and

459
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,199
yeah, I mean, I do that every day

460
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,079
though. It's just that conscious contact

461
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,360
that that positive, you know, collective

462
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,320
energy and prayer. John, any squali at

463
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,000
all? Any side effects? Any bad memories?

464
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,839
Uh, you know, of course, I would I

465
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,480
remember some things, but God really

466
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,040
saved that and keeping it minimal. But I

467
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,560
I have no issues. I was back to playing

468
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,160
basketball within the next month to two

469
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,160
months. This is a picture of her playing

470
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,800
basketball, by the way. I can't believe

471
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,480
this. But, uh, I was back to just being

472
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,279
a kid and having fun. and you know

473
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,519
there's no lifelong issues. The doctors

474
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,079
actually call me back just to see what's

475
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,519
going on with me and they're in awe.

476
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,880
It's not because anything's wrong. It's

477
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,959
just because they want to see me. So

478
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,120
these are these are just some of the

479
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,040
summary notes. The actual packet of your

480
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,839
medical records is quite thick. And one

481
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,360
possible theory is that the cold water

482
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,199
because when you were very cold water

483
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
obviously ice there changes how drowning

484
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,480
happens may have decreased the amount of

485
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,399
oxygen that John's organs needed to stay

486
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,480
alive. But you know, when you look at

487
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,800
these records, there really isn't a good

488
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,959
reason why you were able to sit here,

489
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,279
make words with your mouth, and be

490
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,720
neurologically intact. I could imagine

491
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,240
your body having survived. I can't

492
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,000
imagine your mind coming back when I

493
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,360
read what these records are re revealing

494
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,199
to me, which is the thing that's most

495
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,160
stunning. Now, Pastor Jason, you were

496
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,079
there the whole time as you as you as

497
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,920
you witnessed what he was like, and now

498
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,519
sitting here on my stage, how do you

499
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,440
reconcile that? You know, it's the power

500
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,040
of prayer. I mean, there's no question

501
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
when we walked into his room, the doctor

502
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,399
said he was brain dead, even after his

503
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,800
pulse came back. Brain dead. Rudiment

504
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,480
rudimentary brain function. Um, if he

505
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,560
survived, he would be a vegetable for

506
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,160
the rest of his life. 1% survival rate.

507
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,920
We took a group of pastors in and we

508
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,600
prayed that night. And some incredible

509
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,040
miracles happened in the room. And I

510
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
walked back out to Joyce and I said, "He

511
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,760
is walking out of the hospital. I don't

512
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,880
know how. I don't know why." You knew

513
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,919
it. I knew it. So, speaking of Joyce,

514
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,199
your mom, I know that she's going

515
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,959
through some medical issues. couldn't be

516
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,559
here today. So, since she's not here,

517
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,240
let me ask you in privacy cuz she'll

518
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,600
probably never see this. What do you

519
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
think about how Chrissy played her in

520
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,280
the movie? Well, they did a sizzle

521
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,480
before the trailer and me and mom are in

522
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,079
the living room watching the sizzle and

523
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,919
we're looking at each other like, "When

524
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,400
did mom do this this sizzle? When did

525
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,600
mom over when did she do this voice over

526
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,520
and we're sitting there in such

527
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:39,559
confusion like what's going on?" Well,

528
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,559
it was Chrissy and just we were floored.

529
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,320
Feels good, doesn't it? Yeah. I mean, I

530
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,960
had to get it right. This Yeah, it's

531
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,640
Joyce. Yeah, I I wanted Absolutely. I

532
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,760
mean, it's so important. Let me give you

533
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,440
the final word. What do you want the

534
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,360
audience to walk away from with seeing

535
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,200
this film? Um, you know, Chrissy as

536
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,039
Joyce has a speech at the very end of

537
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,520
the film. And in that final speech,

538
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,360
Chrissy says as Joyce, that love is the

539
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,880
most powerful force in the universe. I

540
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,000
want everyone to walk out of the theater

541
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,480
knowing that love wins. And when we love

542
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,760
each other, we can have a breakthrough.

543
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,440
God bless you all. Thanks for being

544
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,360
here. Break Crew is in theaters this

545
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,799
weekend. Go check it out. And you're all

546
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,320
going home with a copy of Christy's

547
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,160
book, This Is Me. It's now in paperback.

548
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,160
Take the time. Read about love. We'll be

549
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
right back. Thank you for watching.
