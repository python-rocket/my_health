1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,520
Dog attacks caught on tape.

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,359
>> I could see him ripping my arm and I

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,840
could see the blood on his face

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,480
>> and how a simple paper cut almost turned

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,519
deadly.

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,440
>> It was a flesh eating bacteria eating

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,080
through all of the tissue.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,240
>> Plus, Rev Run and his wife Justine open

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,560
up about their biggest relationship

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,800
battles. Does he have anything he does

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,359
that tests your faith?

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,359
>> Coming up next.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,120
season 11 starts now.

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:51,360
[Music]

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,160
Today's show contains content meant for

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,719
mature audiences. Some of our discussion

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,719
may be inappropriate for teens and young

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,719
children.

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,840
>> We love dogs on this show. I always look

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,840
forward to playing with my dog, Khesi.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,479
But what happens when a man's best

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,119
friend bites back? That's the question

23
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,040
today. Four and a half million dogs are

24
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,119
biting people and they occur every year

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,680
in this country. That's roughly one out

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,680
of 70 people being attacked. And many of

27
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,920
these attacks are caught on tape, giving

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
us insight into those terrifying moments

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,880
when a canine goes on the attack. Take a

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,880
look.

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,280
Not all dogs come with a warning sign.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,960
It can take seconds for canines to go

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,960
from cuddly to attack mode.

34
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,040
[Applause]

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,280
These dogs were not afraid to go

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,360
head-to-head with the authorities as

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
they ripped off the bumper and chunks of

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,360
the tires in an apparent fit of road

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,360
rage.

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,960
>> In Minnesota, a woman was knocked down

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,479
and bit by a dog while taking out her

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,960
garbage. Grab it. Grab it.

43
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,200
>> Some dog bites can be fatal. There have

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,840
been hundreds of deaths from K9 attacks

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,920
in recent years. Terrifying surveillance

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,200
video captured a woman getting attacked

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,840
by a pack of dogs on her front lawn. And

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,080
what about a dog in your own home? This

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,319
woman was violently attacked by a dog in

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,640
her own living room, leaving her with

51
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,959
stitches, scars, and a harrowing

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,959
question. What caused this aggressive

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,959
outburst?

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,239
>> Sabrina, who you just saw on the tape,

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,120
joins me now. Thank goodness you're

56
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,920
okay.

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
>> Thanks.

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,840
>> You're a dog lover. I am.

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,760
>> And this dog that attacked you though

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,040
was not your dog. How did you come in

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,360
contact with it?

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,760
>> No, I was driving around in my

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,319
neighborhood and like I said, I'm a big

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,519
dog lover. So, I saw this dog and the

65
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,920
second time I saw him, I stopped and it

66
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,879
took a little bit to coersse him into my

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,840
car, but I got him and I took him home

68
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,599
and I gave him a bath and the next

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,840
morning I went to see if he was chipped.

70
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,239
Took him to my vets's office and he was.

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,680
So, I found the guy on Facebook and he

72
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,159
had moved to Peru and left his dog with

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,640
a friend and he ended up on the street

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,120
and that's how that's how I came with

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,120
him.

76
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
>> So, you you agreed to keep the dog in

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,640
your home, you made it a part of your

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,080
family, you slept in the same bed, all

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,040
the things that an owner does with their

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,280
pet.

81
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:31,440
>> When did the behavior begin to shift? So

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,319
after um about a month uh it was a

83
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,120
Thursday and when I wasn't home that day

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:42,159
my cat got out and my dad came home and

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,040
he had killed the cat.

86
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,440
He had killed the cat and that's very

87
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,120
tough and it's very hard to speak about

88
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,879
and that's the guilt that I deal with

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,920
today. But um I called the owner and I

90
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,159
said, "I need you to have someone come

91
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,799
pick him up." And he said, "Wait till

92
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,760
Monday." And this was a Thursday. And

93
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,239
then

94
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,040
>> I I got attacked on Saturday.

95
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,040
>> What prompted that attack?

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,680
>> So I was in my living room. We were all

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,159
in the living room and him and my 15

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,439
pound pickies got in a scuffle and it

99
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,440
was right next to me. But I knew this

100
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,560
dog was going to kill my dog. He was 90

101
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,000
pounds. Yeah,

102
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,240
>> he was 90 lb and he was going to kill my

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,600
pickies. So, I was right there and I was

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,960
trying to separate them, doing

105
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,520
everything I could and the dog changed

106
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,360
in a snap and I became his target.

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
>> You can see in this video that the dog

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
locked his teeth in Sabrina's arms, was

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,720
not letting go, dragging you around.

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,919
What was going through your mind while

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,600
he's attacking you like this?

112
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,000
>> You know, you almost kind of don't

113
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,000
realize it's happening.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I

115
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,919
it sounds crazy, but in my mind I was

116
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,400
thinking that he'll bite me and then let

117
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,000
go. Like it was just something quick.

118
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:04,000
>> But after a couple seconds I could see

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,600
him ripping my arm and I could see the

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,320
blood on his face.

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,680
>> Your blood?

122
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,759
>> My my blood on his face. And he was

123
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
trying before all before he locked on my

124
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,520
arm, he was trying to bite everywhere.

125
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,240
So, he took a chunk out of the out of my

126
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
leg.

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,840
>> Oh my goodness. I can see

128
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,680
>> he took a chunk out of my leg. And

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,919
>> this is actually This is a graft.

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,919
>> No, this is the graft.

131
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,320
>> Oh,

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,000
>> yeah.

133
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,000
>> Yes. This is skin from my thigh. And he

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,919
ripped it all apart. He took a chunk out

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,639
of here. I didn't even know he had taken

136
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,199
a chunk out of my leg.

137
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,800
But um when he was on my arm, I started

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
punching him, trying to get him off of

139
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,160
me, screaming, trying to get him off of

140
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,840
me. But of course, he just saw red.

141
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,199
>> That's the wound that the dog made right

142
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
after.

143
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,120
>> Yes,

144
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,479
>> they treated it. These are these are I'm

145
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,680
sorry. Gruesome. The show

146
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:01,120
>> that that picture is actually even like

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,560
not as there was worse worse. It was all

148
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,000
open and

149
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,759
>> really I can't even look at them.

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,120
They're so bad. I I I I didn't want to

151
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,960
use them for our audience either because

152
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,800
they are too gruesome. At least these

153
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,639
images I hope will share how severe this

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,479
is without becoming too grotesque for

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,080
the person watching to pay attention.

156
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,800
But I want to point it out because the

157
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,600
dog bit and does not like dog bites and

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,440
tears off.

159
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,880
>> Tears as he's as he has his jaw locked

160
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,680
on me, he's moving his head around just

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,360
like you know I became the prey. So

162
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
>> how did you get this dog off you? It

163
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,080
would have killed you. Okay. So, my dad

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
was home at the time, but he was outside

165
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,800
mowing the grass. He could not hear me

166
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,440
screaming. So, he was right outside when

167
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,919
I opened the door. He grabbed a broom,

168
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
started hitting him. He let go, but then

169
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,919
I ran

170
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,919
>> the broom. Look at this.

171
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,479
>> I ran in. Yeah. So, I ran back inside

172
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,039
and he um

173
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,039
and then the dog stays coming after me.

174
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,160
He was he was obsessed with just

175
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,479
attacking me.

176
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,120
>> Oh my goodness. And um next thing I knew

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,479
the ambulance was there, but they

178
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,919
couldn't get to me because they had to

179
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,639
go through the front door.

180
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,160
>> The dog's there.

181
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,960
>> And the dog is there. So I So I crawled

182
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,080
through the window because there was no

183
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,919
other way they were going to get to me.

184
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,039
And I could have bled out. I think I'm

185
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,479
>> the doctor. I'll tell you, you could

186
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,919
have bled out that with that injury.

187
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,360
>> And this as well. And I didn't even

188
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,120
realize this was happening.

189
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
>> You didn't damage the nerves or

190
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,280
>> Yes. The tendons were like hanging on by

191
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,360
a thread

192
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,919
and um my doctors did amazing work and

193
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,199
were able to save my arm. Save my hand.

194
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,199
Actually, not my arm. Save my hand.

195
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,400
>> I understand there's a silver lining

196
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,560
around this tragedy.

197
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,360
>> There is. Um so obviously the months

198
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,759
after I this happened to me. It happened

199
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,560
to me February 9th and the months after

200
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,720
I was in therapy. I was bedridden and I

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,599
had to do all that all those things

202
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,639
because when my hand my hand was in a

203
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,160
splint for uh like a long time and when

204
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,919
it came off I couldn't do anything. This

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,120
was me trying to move my hand.

206
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,960
>> It's not moving, right?

207
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,360
>> So I couldn't do anything. I went to

208
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,000
therapy obviously and now and it

209
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,520
impacted my life. I know what it is to

210
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,919
not be able to do the most simplest

211
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,639
things, you know, take a shower, get

212
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,000
dressed, um put on shoes, drive. I know

213
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,879
what it's like to not be able to do

214
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,120
those things and I am now in school to

215
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,680
be um an occupational therapy assistant.

216
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,560
So,

217
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,039
>> so

218
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
>> yeah,

219
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,360
>> you can do what they did for you.

220
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,080
>> I can.

221
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,159
>> Thank you for sharing.

222
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,800
>> Thank you so much. Thanks for having me.

223
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,040
>> Up next, imagine being attacked by two

224
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,440
dogs at once. Both vicious. How one

225
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,600
woman survived a terrifying assault and

226
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,860
what to do if a dog turns on you. Stay

227
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,290
with us.

228
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:57,950
[Music]

229
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:57,950
[Applause]

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,920
We're back with dog attacks caught on

231
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,640
tape. My next guest was out on her

232
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,680
morning walk when this was caught on

233
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,080
tape. Two dogs coming from across the

234
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,839
street and began attacking her on her

235
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,519
own front lawn. There she is trying to

236
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,760
run away, right? But she fell. She fell

237
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,519
and they jumped on her. Rhonda, the

238
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,920
woman in that video, joins us now via

239
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,680
Zoom to tell us how she survived. Now

240
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
Ronda, we just saw these dogs. They're

241
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
charging after you out of nowhere. What

242
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,040
was going through your mind when that

243
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,080
happened?

244
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:39,040
>> I was thinking at that point, where do I

245
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,360
go? What do I do? And

246
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,279
before I could complete that process, I

247
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
was being attacked.

248
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,120
>> And as the dogs begin, they started on

249
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,680
my lower extremities. The brown dog came

250
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:57,040
all the way up to my throat. I could

251
00:09:51,680 --> 00:10:00,399
literally feel his breath on me and I

252
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,959
could just smell it

253
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,200
across the street. Luckily, the

254
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,320
neighbor's dog came and chased them off.

255
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,440
I was eventually able to get up,

256
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,200
run back to my home, and get in the

257
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,040
house. But at that point, I still didn't

258
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,640
feel safe.

259
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,920
I still do not feel safe today. But what

260
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,760
I also know is that through this

261
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,920
process, I'm still committed to living

262
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,519
my best life because my life is honestly

263
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,839
and truthfully changed forever.

264
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,279
>> Yeah.

265
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,240
>> But I'm committed to living my best life

266
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,600
and overcoming this obstacle.

267
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,279
>> Good for you, Rhonda. Thank you for

268
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,160
joining us. Let me bring in someone who

269
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,079
has insight into a dog's mind. trainer

270
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
and animal behavioralist Victoria

271
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,000
Stillwell. Bringing my little Khesi

272
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,680
here.

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,440
So, you know, in your experience, what

274
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,839
triggers these kinds of attacks from

275
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,000
dogs? It's so foreign to me, but one in

276
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,760
70 of us. Even in my audience, I pulled

277
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,240
folks in a little break. It's more than

278
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,399
that have been bitten by a dog.

279
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,040
>> These kind of attacks seem to me to be

280
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,320
like more like predatory behavior. But

281
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,959
in general, dogs will bite people to

282
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,880
keep themselves safe because of fear,

283
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,959
because they're protecting resources,

284
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
because they're in pain, or for some

285
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,279
other medical reason.

286
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
>> Let's walk through this. Some of the

287
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,440
reasons that a dog come may feel

288
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,279
territorial. A dog may want to protect

289
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,040
themselves or because they're in fear

290
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,160
act out. Yeah. So, the first is, and

291
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,399
these are all pictures I want you to

292
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,720
memorize. This is a growling or snarling

293
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,640
dog.

294
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,959
>> Yeah. And growling and snarling, all of

295
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,600
these showing teeth, they are warning

296
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,640
behaviors. So, those are very overt

297
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,760
signs that we recognize. We back away.

298
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,040
The next one,

299
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
>> showing the teeth. Look at them in

300
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,320
there.

301
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
>> Showing those teeth.

302
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,920
>> Please don't do that.

303
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
>> And snapping.

304
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,600
>> You don't want teeth like that.

305
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,120
>> Yeah, that's like a warning sign as

306
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,680
well. Showing teeth. They're all telling

307
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,000
you back away. Back away. Back away. And

308
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,040
then the the snapping sometimes is also

309
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,399
a warning.

310
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,680
>> And then the rig snapping. I guess

311
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,720
they're not their purpose missing you,

312
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,399
right? They don't miss you by action.

313
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,920
>> Well, sometimes they do, sometimes they

314
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,440
don't. Sometimes they show an inhibited

315
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,639
bite, sometimes they miss. you get out

316
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,800
the way. So, but here is where the the

317
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,639
body language that you have to look for

318
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,120
is sometimes the body is very stiff, the

319
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,600
tail is very rigid, but you can also

320
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,839
have tails that wag very quickly back

321
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,360
and forth. There are also some signs

322
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,600
that are much less, I would say, well,

323
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,360
very subtle that a dog is uncomfortable.

324
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,079
There's a lip licking

325
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,760
>> when a dog yawns. If you go to greet a

326
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,600
dog, a strange dog, and the dog goes on

327
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
its back and shows you its belly, it's

328
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,839
not saying, "Rub my belly." It's a cut

329
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,519
off signal. It's saying, "Don't come

330
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,200
near me. Don't I don't want to have

331
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,639
interaction with you." And that's why a

332
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,000
lot of people misconrue.

333
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,839
>> I would think that would say come

334
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,320
because if Kisa did that, I'd scratch

335
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
her belly.

336
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
>> She knows you, right? So my dog loves

337
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,160
having her belly scratched. But if it's

338
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,560
a dog I don't know and I'm going up to

339
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,920
that dog and that dog flips over on its

340
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,480
back quickly, I know leave it alone.

341
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,680
So, what should you feel? What would you

342
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,680
recommend that we do if we're in a

343
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,440
dangerous situation with a dog?

344
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,920
>> It's there. We're here. How do we avoid

345
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
a problem?

346
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,720
>> Oh, it's really hard. Stay calm. Don't

347
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,320
stare at it. And try and be boring. I I

348
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,480
teach a lot of dog bite prevention to

349
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,480
children and I teach them be boring

350
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,560
because then you're not fueling the

351
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,880
fire. You're not exacerbating any kind

352
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,079
of anger, frustration, or predation that

353
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,839
the dog might have.

354
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,200
>> What if the dog's already attacking you?

355
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,680
It's already lunging at you.

356
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,839
>> Yeah. And this is very, very scary. So,

357
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,680
look, we are pre-programmed to survive.

358
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,839
All right? As our dogs are, we will do

359
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,800
what we need to do in order to survive.

360
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,320
We will fight. If you have a piece of

361
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,920
clothing you can put over the dog's

362
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,480
eyes, if you have a bag you can put in

363
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,000
between you and the dog, if he gets you

364
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,839
on the ground, he or she gets you on the

365
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,440
ground, you can roll up like a stone,

366
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,440
protect your neck, protect your

367
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,519
vulnerable parts of your body, hope that

368
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,760
help comes. And here's the thing. the

369
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,320
dog is biting you, pull the sleeve. Or

370
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,639
if, for example, this is the dog biting,

371
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,800
instead of taking your arm away, feed

372
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
your arm into the dog. Because what

373
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
happens is that when the dog's biting

374
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,920
and you're trying to take your arm away,

375
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
which is our instinct, it's going to rip

376
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,920
the skin. You put your arm and you feed

377
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,839
your dog into the feed your arm into the

378
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,519
dog's mouth, it's going to do much less

379
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,800
damage. But that's hard to do.

380
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,560
>> But it makes sense. You get puncture

381
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,000
wounds rather than huge pieces being

382
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,920
ripped off as we just saw in the earlier

383
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,839
segment. Remember everybody, dogs don't

384
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,320
want to attack. They'd rather cuddle and

385
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,800
play like Khisa here. But I think we're

386
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
better off with our dogs by far. And if

387
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,360
you know them, scratch their belly.

388
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,440
Otherwise, I learned something from

389
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,620
Victoria. Be careful. All right, we'll

390
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:44,079
be right back. Thank you.

392
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,680
Up next, unbelievable health nightmares.

393
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,600
From paper cuts that turned into a

394
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,480
life-threatening emergency to a runny

395
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,160
nose that lasted for months. Find out

396
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
how one woman thought it was just bad

397
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,519
allergies. Turned out her running nose

398
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,519
was from fluid leaking from her brain.

399
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,079
We've all suffered the pain of a paper

400
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,760
cut. Opening an envelope, grabbing

401
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,079
papers too quickly, and it usually heals

402
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,240
within a day or two. But for one woman,

403
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,720
her paper cut turned into a shocking

404
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,360
health nightmare. Within 48 hours,

405
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,320
Heather's tiny cut on her pinky turned

406
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,240
into this. She found herself in kidney

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,839
failure, fighting for her life. What

408
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,519
could have caused such a little paper

409
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,000
cut that turned into a big health

410
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,360
emergency? Well, Heather joins us now

411
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,440
via Zoom. So, Heather, how did you first

412
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,120
cut your pinky finger or orient us to

413
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
what was happening?

414
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,399
>> Hi, good morning. Um, well, we were

415
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,760
moving actually from one side of our

416
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,839
island to the other. And, um, in the

417
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,560
hustle and bustle, just being busy

418
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,680
unloading boxes, um, cleaning and

419
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,759
whatnot, I noticed a tiny cut in between

420
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,800
my, uh, ring finger and my pinky. And,

421
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:04,480
um, it started swelling. Um, I the pain

422
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:08,800
was just so bad. And then within hours

423
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,199
of that, I got a fever. And so they uh

424
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,040
diagnosed me with nefertizing fasciitis.

425
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,279
>> So let me show some of the photos of

426
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,959
what the paper cut did to your hand. So

427
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,560
I'm going to put a red circle here.

428
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,160
We're show a picture of your pinky where

429
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,720
the cut was.

430
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,320
>> And then the early stages of the flesh

431
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,160
eating infection are evident here. You

432
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,519
can see the skin's discolored. Uh and

433
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,959
this, you know, pretty aggressively

434
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,199
moving along. This happens very quickly,

435
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,959
by the way. And then after the surgery,

436
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,639
they removed the infection and they, you

437
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,560
know, sort of sewed you back up again,

438
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,839
but it was still very swollen. So,

439
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,360
Heather, when doctors were doing all

440
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,360
this and trying to save your life and

441
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,920
your hand, what did they say was causing

442
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
all the swelling in your hand and your

443
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,320
arm?

444
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,800
>> Um, so basically it was a flesheating

445
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:55,440
bacteria that was eating through um all

446
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,880
of the tissue. Um, by the time I got to

447
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,680
the hospital, it had already eaten all

448
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,120
the way through my tendons and basically

449
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,559
I was going into kidney failure and um,

450
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,600
I was really I mean if they couldn't

451
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,679
stop it, amputation was the first step

452
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,039
otherwise um, you know, they were going

453
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,760
to try to at least get as much of the

454
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,319
infection and save my arm um, and my

455
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,640
life.

456
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,640
>> Let let me show you what why you were

457
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,400
diagnosed with necroizing fasciitis and

458
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,480
what that really is. is more commonly

459
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,319
known as flesh-eating bacteria. And it

460
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,240
can start with just a scrape on, for

461
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,760
example, in this animation, your leg.

462
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,200
And in Heather's case, it was a tiny

463
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,640
little cut in your hands. These

464
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,320
bacteria, let's just say there these

465
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
green things on the surface of the skin.

466
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,360
There's the cut there in the blood

467
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,039
vessels, but the green bacteria come in

468
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
from outside and once they get in

469
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
contact with the wound, there's no

470
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,799
protective barrier. They just spread

471
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,919
out. They they create all kinds of

472
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,440
infection, inflammation in the

473
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,960
surrounding area. That's why it gets

474
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,960
red. And then they start to cause

475
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,240
closure of blood vessels, thrombosis.

476
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,240
And these can be devastating because

477
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
they shut off all the blood supply to

478
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,720
the area that's infected. That's why you

479
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,320
get parts of your body, your legs, feet,

480
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
your hands, arms, they start to turn

481
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,919
black. That's what this flesh eating

482
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,760
bacteria ultimately does. And ultimately

483
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,120
once it infects your extremities, it'll

484
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,280
put your entire body into a state of

485
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,640
shock which can cause the vital organs

486
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,400
like the kidneys and the heart to shut

487
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,960
down as you were describing. So,

488
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,039
Heather, you're you're not 100% you're

489
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,320
not sure exactly how you got this

490
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:24,880
infection, but give me your best guess.

491
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,120
>> Um, well, the rain water is caught uh

492
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,640
most times in Hawaii for bathing,

493
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,960
cooking,

494
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,799
um, uh, just washing dishes and whatnot.

495
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,559
We don't drink it, but there's big

496
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:38,000
catchment tanks and we catch the rain

497
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:41,120
water. And I believe that the rainwater

498
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,840
had bacteria in it and it just made its

499
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,080
direct entry through that little tiny

500
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,919
cut and that's what got me.

501
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,080
>> Can you believe that such a tiny paper

502
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,679
cut led to such a gargantuan health

503
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,039
nightmare?

504
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,840
>> Gosh. Um I was shocked that something so

505
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,120
minor would, you know, almost cause me

506
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,360
to lose my life. And you know, it it

507
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,600
just it really was something very

508
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,000
shocking and just happened so quickly.

509
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,559
But I just really I thank all the

510
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,960
doctors that saved my life and you know,

511
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,280
especially Dr. Pereira for, you know,

512
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,039
rehealing my hand basically.

513
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,320
>> Well, I'm glad you're doing well. Thanks

514
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,080
for sharing your story, Heather.

515
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,240
Whenever I get a paper cut, even if it

516
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,080
seems tiny, here's what I do. First off,

517
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,919
you wash your hands and you clean the

518
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,520
wound. The basics, what your mom taught

519
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,960
you to do. I would just rinse it with

520
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,720
warm soap and water. You don't have to

521
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,480
put lots of chemicals in there. Then dry

522
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,160
it thoroughly, cover it with a bandage,

523
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,160
and just let it be for a while. It'll

524
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,160
heal. Up next, another health nightmare

525
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,559
that will shock you. One woman discovers

526
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,200
the fluid running from her nose isn't

527
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,370
snot, but rather brain fluid that's

528
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,679
leaking. Stay with us.

to a cold or allergies. But what if your

543
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,240
nose wasn't running because of snot?

544
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,720
Andrea's nose was dripping for more than

545
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,520
seven months before she learned that it

546
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,200
was coming actually out of her brain. It

547
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,880
was brain fluid coming out of her nose.

548
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,720
Andre is joining us now via Zoom. So

549
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,400
Andre, when you first started noticing

550
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,039
that your nose was running, you were

551
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,960
told it was bad allergies, but then it

552
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,400
got worse. So please help everyone

553
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,799
understand how much fluid was actually

554
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,440
coming out of your nose.

555
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,120
>> Well, it started out dripping and then

556
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,000
it went to pouring out of my nose. So, I

557
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,159
went from tissues to paper towels and I

558
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,720
had to put them up my nose to because

559
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,799
there was just so much fluid coming out.

560
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
>> Oh my goodness. How when you went out,

561
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,600
what would you do? You just keep blowing

562
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,039
your nose.

563
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,559
>> No, I always had tissue in my hand and I

564
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,880
could kind of feel when it was going to

565
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,480
come out. It would kind of build up and

566
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,440
then I could feel it. So, I would just

567
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,600
quickly put a paper towel there or, you

568
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,000
know, try to catch it without anyone

569
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,320
knowing. I hit it pretty well. Did it

570
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,159
have a taste or a smell? What did it

571
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,720
feel like?

572
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,360
>> It just it looked like water. It was

573
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,280
tasteless and odorless there. You know,

574
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,480
there was no color to it at all. It just

575
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,159
looked like water.

576
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,640
>> And you see other symptoms then started

577
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,159
to turn your life upside down. So, how

578
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,000
did your health nightmare get even

579
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,679
worse?

580
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,640
>> Well, the whole time I had a sinus

581
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,159
infection. Um, so I started going to

582
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
doctors,

583
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,120
urgent cares, ERS to try to figure out

584
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,559
what was going on and they all just said

585
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:55,520
it was allergies. So I had to sleep

586
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:57,200
sitting up because if I laid flat, the

587
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,679
fluid would go down my throat and I

588
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:04,080
would wake up choking on it. So um, it

589
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,440
just it felt like I had pneumonia. My

590
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,000
chest was real heavy and I just I had

591
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,760
this horrible feeling that I was dying.

592
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,320
Oh my goodness. That's that's never a

593
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,760
good feeling to have. So, you actually

594
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,880
were able to find an answer. And there

595
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,960
are a lot of people who probably have a

596
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,720
story similar to yours who have no idea.

597
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,320
Let's meet her neurosurgeon, Dr. Michael

598
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,320
Lamole, who's actually the surgeon who

599
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,760
saved Congresswoman Gabby Gford's life

600
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,840
when she was shot in the head in that

601
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,080
horrible case in Arizona. He also

602
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,000
happens to be my brother-in-law. How did

603
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,240
you diagnose Andrea with her with her

604
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,919
her leak of brain fluid? Well, me after

605
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,679
we collected some of the fluid from her

606
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,000
nose, we were able to diagnose a

607
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,679
spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid

608
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,440
fistula or CSF leak.

609
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,000
>> And a CSF leak is when some of the

610
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,320
watery fluid around the brain is able to

611
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,600
go through a defect or a hole to escape

612
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,960
to the outside world, usually through

613
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,720
the nose or the ear.

614
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,000
>> So, here's the thing. These holes can be

615
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,919
caused by injuries. They can cause by

616
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,400
car accidents. They caused by surgery.

617
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,240
And your sister, my wife Lisa, when we

618
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,919
were first married, banged her head

619
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,280
against the stairs. Actually,

620
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,559
interestingly, the under foot of her

621
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,240
stairs when she was in, you know, under

622
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,400
getting something from a closet and then

623
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,280
she had this weird metallic taste in her

624
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,559
mouth for a long time. That's typical

625
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,760
>> typical for CSF leaks.

626
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,640
>> Yeah. And when she went upside down, it

627
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,280
would get much worse.

628
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,280
>> Yes.

629
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,039
>> Why didn't you tell us?

630
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,320
>> Now he's Now he's helping.

631
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,760
>> You couldn't help your own sister.

632
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,200
>> A bit more education since then.

633
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,799
>> All right. I want to thank Mike actually

634
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,159
because Mona gets really mad at me. He

635
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,080
protects me. Otherwise, that'd be it'd

636
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,000
be curtains for me. So to put this in

637
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,600
perspective, this is as much fluid as

638
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,760
our brain makes in a day roughly about

639
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,919
about half a liter roughly.

640
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,559
>> So how much would typically come out of

641
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,720
your nose if you were actually leaking?

642
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,960
>> In severe cases like Andrea's you could

643
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,000
literally feel the palm of your hand.

644
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,200
However,

645
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,559
>> it doesn't have to be that way. That's

646
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,200
what's so frustrating. Some some of

647
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,960
these cases are so subtle that you might

648
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,880
not see it right away and it could take

649
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,440
years to diagnose. But in Andrea's case,

650
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,120
in Lisa's case, you really need to meet

651
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,400
three conditions for this to happen. To

652
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,840
have a leak through your nose, you have

653
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,280
to have a tear in the lining of the

654
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,120
brain called the dura, the thick

655
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,240
leathery sack that surrounds the brain.

656
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,080
You have to have a hole in the base of

657
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,520
the skull. And you have to have a a

658
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,799
breach in the in the lining of the nose.

659
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,000
And when all those come together, you

660
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,000
have a leak. And like you said, that can

661
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,279
happen from tumors, from trauma, or it

662
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
can happen for no apparent reason, like

663
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,640
an Andrea is an idiopathic case.

664
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,320
>> And it'll look like this. So again, it

665
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,320
come right out of your nose and when

666
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,360
you're when you cough or sit up, it'll

667
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,720
it'll come out like that.

668
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,000
>> Right out like that. We'll actually ask

669
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,120
the patients to lean forward like

670
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,039
they're sniffing and you'll see it

671
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,960
literally come out dripping like that in

672
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,159
severe cases. And if they don't heal on

673
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,440
their own, like Lisa,

674
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,440
>> if you see this, by the way, please call

675
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,480
somebody. This is this is not a runny

676
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
nose from a little

677
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,279
>> That's not normal. And if if they don't

678
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,880
heal on their own, then we have to

679
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,799
consider surgical options like putting a

680
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,159
video endoscope up your nose, looking

681
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,600
for the hole, finding it, surgically

682
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,360
repairing it with our ENT colleagues.

683
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
And is that how you paired on Andrea's?

684
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,520
>> That's exactly what we did.

685
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,679
>> So, Andrea, how what did it feel like

686
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,880
when that that fluid was finally fixed?

687
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,880
It wasn't leaking anymore from your

688
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,559
brain.

689
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,640
>> Oh, I had a chronic cough. Um, I had

690
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:03,919
really bad chest pain. I was exhausted.

691
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,240
Um, and really dizzy, you know, kind of

692
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,960
in a fog and I had a lot of sinus

693
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,159
pressure. So, once it was fixed, it was

694
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,640
like night and day.

695
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,240
>> Oh my goodness.

696
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,840
>> Night and day. And Michael, if you

697
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
hadn't gotten Andre in time, what could

698
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,080
have happened? Because you're not

699
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,760
supposed to have a breach in the most

700
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,559
precious part of the body, the area

701
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,080
around your brain.

702
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,679
>> And and and the symptoms she had were

703
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,279
were dead on. The brain needs to be

704
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,039
bathed in this fluid. Not only does it

705
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,600
provide nutrients and take away waste,

706
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,520
but it literally provides a liquid

707
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,360
cushion to sit on. And when you drain

708
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,279
too much of that, like Andrea did, the

709
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,559
brain sags, the lining stretches, it

710
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,320
gives these terrible headaches and

711
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,400
symptoms. But the most feared

712
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,000
complication is menitis. And that's when

713
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,240
the bacteria from the nose literally

714
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,919
migrate up through that defect and

715
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,240
inflame the lining of the brain or the

716
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,919
brain itself. And if untreated, in worst

717
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,480
case scenario, this can rapidly proceed

718
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,760
to death.

719
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,600
>> Oh my goodness. Andrew, are you feeling

720
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,840
okay now?

721
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,640
>> I'm feeling a lot better. I take it day

722
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,120
by day. I am on disability now because I

723
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,400
do have chronic migraines and chronic

724
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:05,679
facial and sinus pain. Um, as well as

725
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,279
anxiety following the surgery. Um, so I

726
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,159
have my good days, I have my bad days,

727
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,200
but my family and my faith keep me

728
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,440
going. And I'm just really thankful to

729
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,360
Dr. Lamole for everything he did for me.

730
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,080
And I'm still able to be here with my

731
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:23,279
kids and my family. And I'm just very

732
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,960
grateful that I'm sealed. No longer uh

733
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,120
have a CSF leak.

734
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,120
>> Sealed and healed. I'm glad it worked

735
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,159
out. Congratulations, AJ. Mike, thanks

736
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,400
very much for being with us. Thanks for

737
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,500
having me.

738
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,039
>> All right, we'll be right back.

739
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,360

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,039
>> Up next, hip hop royalty are here. Red

faith and marriage, and they win on the

743
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,039
biggest battles couples face. They're

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,679

748
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:58,080
>> No, it's me. We'll find out. Me?

749
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:01,200
[Applause]

750
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,400
Here's a music mogul and a minister.

751
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,039
She's a media maven and the boss behind

752
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,120

755
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,440
and the power of faith and how they

756
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,520
healed from a health emergency they

757
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,200
never thought would happen to them. Come

758
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,760
on out my good friends Rev Run and

759
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,760

760
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:34,859
[Applause]

761
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,320
Boom.

762
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,200
>> I want to do burger.

763
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,240
>> Burger fries. One more time. Burger

764
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,799
fries.

765
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,279
>> All right.

766
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,279
>> I love you, trusty.

767
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,559
>> You're in the middle, right? Okay. I'll

768
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,559
go.

769
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,640
>> I love this. He's He's producing

770
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,320
directors. Make sure the ladies first.

771
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,080
Well, thank you very much. You know,

772
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,600
before we came out, I you were talking

773
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,720
about how to greet each other, right? Of

774
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,080
course, people who are affectionate

775
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,480
towards each other want to hug and kiss

776
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,919
and but I like this burger fries idea.

777
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,640
>> It's got a little something going there.

778
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,399
It works.

779
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,600
>> I just did the elbow quick bump.

780
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,480
>> Elbow's so easy. You don't hurt your

781
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,480
hand that way. Yeah.

782
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,200
>> When guys fist bump, it can be painful.

783
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,760
You can

784
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
>> Yeah.

785
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,200
>> I'm always encouraged by folks of uh

786
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,679
faith and I saw this wonderful quote on

787
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,000
Instagram. God has a bigger plan for me

788
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,399
than I have for myself. Rev. You posted

789
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,840
that. What inspired you? Um, just

790
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,559
thinking about everything that was going

791
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,919
on around me, what's next? How do I

792
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,120
handle the kids? What's going I'm going

793
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,200
going to do the career? We did the

794
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,919
Grammys, all these different things that

795
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,880
are coming at me. And I wanted to know,

796
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,200
okay, what's next? How do I? And I had

797
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,559
to take I out of it and says, he has a

798
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,399
bigger plan for me than I have for

799
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,880
myself. That also encourages you.

800
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,279
>> Yeah.

801
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
>> You start to think, you know, okay, I

802
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,399
want to do this, I want to do that, I'd

803
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,159
like to do this. But what about the

804
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,080
times where you let go and then it comes

805
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,600
out better than you thought it would?

806
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,120
>> So faith is a big part of marriage. So

807
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,760
I'm going to test your faith in Rev.

808
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Does he have anything he does that tests

809
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,600
your faith?

810
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,440
>> Oh,

811
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,679
>> I want to hear the truth here.

812
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,960
>> The nitty-gritty cuz when you live in in

813
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,520
in the same place, it's not always in

814
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,000
harmony.

815
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,600
>> Exactly. So Dr. Oz, he has this thing

816
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,360
where and why would you do this? Take

817
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,080
off your robe.

818
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,799
>> Put it on the floor. What?

819
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,320
>> Who really a man of faith?

820
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,720
>> You got to listen to the whispers so you

821
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,039
don't have to hear the screams. So

822
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,159
>> yeah,

823
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,480
>> first it's like

824
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,200
>> I say, Joey, don't put your robe on the

825
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
floor, babe.

826
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,720
>> And if I don't listen, then what

827
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,000
happens?

828
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,440
>> I go, Joey.

829
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,120
>> That's the scream. That's the scream.

830
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,399
You got to in order to have a marriage,

831
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,440
you have to listen to the whispers so

832
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,960
you don't have to hear us screaming

833
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,399
about the robe.

834
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,000
>> So part of the reason I wanted to have

835
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,720
you guys on, they have a a wonderful new

836
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,880
book. It's called Old School Love.

837
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,159
>> Yes. What does that mean, Rev? Old

838
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,559
school means love is a grownup thing.

839
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,840
Grown folks business, I like to say.

840
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,559
>> Old school opening car doors. Old school

841
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,559
>> holding hands.

842
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,880
>> Holding hands. Old school being

843
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,039
courteous before the divorce rate was

844
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,600
crazy. So, I believe that biblical

845
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,679
principles that are in this book and

846
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,080
some of the ways that we describe them

847
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,360
will work. Like, don't go to bed angry.

848
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,600
People think that's cliche.

849
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,600
>> Yeah, I used to. But that's a scripture

850
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,240
>> because the more we've we found out the

851
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,600
more you can be angry at somebody, the

852
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,320
more you can stay angry. So that one day

853
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,799
itself.

854
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,799
>> Exactly.

855
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,720
>> That's an old school principle.

856
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,480
>> How can two how can two walk together

857
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,320
unless they agree?

858
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,880
>> So that means and that's in the Bible.

859
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,880
That means that love is not so much

860
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
looking in each other's eyes, but it's

861
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,360
looking in the same direction. Oh, I

862
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,760
love that.

863
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,279
>> Yeah,

864
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,559
>> I love that. Not looking in your eyes so

865
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,720
much, but looking forward the same

866
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,360
direction. And if you get on the same

867
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,679
page, you'll have a great marriage.

868
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,399
>> So, you've had challenges in your lives.

869
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,399
And a lot of times, people are pulled

870
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,960
apart by the challenges. You lost a

871
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,360
child.

872
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,039
>> Yes.

873
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,480
>> Which is the most painful thing that I

874
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,399
think any couple can experience. You

875
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,039
lost a daughter a few hours after she

876
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,760
was born.

877
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,440
>> That's heavy.

878
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,399
>> And you said that that you felt lonely

879
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,960
for the child.

880
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,919
>> Yeah.

881
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,960
>> For a while.

882
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,960
>> Um, well, believe it or not, Dr. Oz

883
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,039
before I we decided to have a baby, I

884
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,440
went to Joey and said, "Do you want to

885
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,760
adopt?" And then he said he prayed for

886
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,600
wisdom and God made him reminded me the

887
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,360
first thing she wanted to do was adopt.

888
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,720
So when I went back to her when she got

889
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,320
home from the hospital and said, "Babe,

890
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,200
let's adopt." What happened?

891
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,279
>> Literally, all the pain went away.

892
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,279
>> A lot of couples see their marriages

893
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,360
dissolve in front of them with that kind

894
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,960
of adversity. You think you're cursed

895
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,000
instead of realizing there's some deeper

896
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,399
wisdom there.

897
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,480
>> It reminds me of a basketball team. If

898
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,679
they start arguing within, the team

899
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,159
falls apart. We've never considered when

900
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,000
stressful situations come, doctor, when

901
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,360
things are bothering us or things that

902
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
to fight each other.

903
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,600
>> We're always like sitting together

904
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,519
trying to fight the opposition, the

905
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,600
thing that's coming at our marriage. So

906
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,600
that's in all facets of life, not just

907
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,519
in this particular situation, but in

908
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,240
every situation that comes at us.

909
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,399
>> We're the team.

910
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,000
>> If I'm stressed, like, "Oh god, thank

911
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,240
God I got Justine as a wife."

912
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,399
>> See, my wife learned martial arts so she

913
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,200
could express herself to me differently.

914
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,240
>> Well, you don't want to get in the

915
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,240
middle of a karate chop.

916
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,919
>> No, it happens. Believe me. All right.

917
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,519
Up next, Revon Justine can break down

918
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,360
some of the biggest battles that couples

919
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,519
are facing. And guess what? We caught

920
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,190
them all on tape, so you don't want to

921
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,940
miss it.

922
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,910
[Applause]

923
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,720
[Music]

924
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,640
[Applause]

925
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,919
We are back with Rev Run and Justine

926
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,000
Simmons and we're about to reveal the

927
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,159
biggest battles couples face caught on

928
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,480
tape. Let's take a look at a first

929
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,000
couple who volunteered.

930
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,399
>> So, I came home the other day and I

931
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,559
overheard Nicole on the phone. So, try

932
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,240
not to make too much noise till I heard

933
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,640
my name. So I listen a little closer and

934
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,080
this girl is in there talking about us,

935
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,960
talking bad about us, talking about me.

936
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,880
Girl got the nerve to call me cheap. So

937
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,559
I had to do a little investigation, you

938
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,919
know, for my own personal information. I

939
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:16,480
went in her phone and I found all these

940
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,919
text messages. I could not believe.

941
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,360
>> He couldn't believe it. But he's here.

942
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,679
David and his girlfriend Nicole are

943
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,039
joining us. How did Nicole talking about

944
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,000
you behind your back affect your

945
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,240
relationship?

946
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,480
>> Uh, it it annoyed me. It makes me very

947
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,399
uncomfortable. It puts a lot of pressure

948
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,559
on me, as a matter of fact.

949
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,360
>> So, you actually mentioned the text. I'm

950
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,039
I'm going to show them with the

951
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,440
audience. Is that okay,

952
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,480
>> everybody? All right. So, here it is.

953
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,360
>> You did it.

954
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,640
>> She She texted he did that thing again.

955
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,399
Insert eye roll here. And then Nicole

956
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,640
went on to say something that's a bit

957
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,360
more provocative. I think I should say

958
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,159
something. The groups and coupons are

959
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,039
not the wave. It kind of aggravating me.

960
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,159
>> Really? Yeah.

961
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,600
>> So, Nicole, why do you turn to your

962
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,519
friends talk about things that are

963
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,519
bothering you in your relationship?

964
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,679
>> I mean, I talk to my close girlfriends

965
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,039
because I just want a safe space. I'm

966
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,799
thinking it's private. I just want to

967
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,720
vent. I don't want to hurt his feelings.

968
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,159
I just want to get it off my chest.

969
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,720
>> Was he like this when you met him?

970
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,839
>> Keep it real.

971
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,399
>> I didn't I didn't

972
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,240
>> notice.

973
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,800
>> Quite No. No.

974
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,520
>> I didn't quite notice so much. There may

975
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,040
have been a little

976
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,679
>> coupon came later.

977
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,760
>> Yeah,

978
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,159
>> they started coupon snipping later.

979
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,679
>> No, I were you like that when she

980
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,359
>> Were you always frugal?

981
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,919
>> I I always have a plan.

982
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,839
>> Okay.

983
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,919
>> I always I keep things a certain way. I

984
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,919
like to keep orderly and if if this is

985
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,720
the way that works best, I I see no

986
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,119
reason to.

987
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,839
>> Right.

988
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,560
>> That's one thing, Dr. Uh we have to

989
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,280
realize when we're in that dating stage,

990
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,000
if that's a red flag for for you, then

991
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,000
you just move on. You know, a lot of a

992
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,800
lot of times we just want to, you know,

993
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,280
okay, hope it away. Yeah. Hope it away.

994
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,079
>> So now you you have to meet him halfway

995
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,000
with this.

996
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,960
>> Nicole, I gotta say, yeah, the most

997
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,720
important thing that I've heard this

998
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,079
wonderful couple share and it's I in my

999
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,520
marriage as well, you better be clear

1000
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,280
and honest about it because if you hold

1001
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,000
your feelings now, you're just hurting

1002
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,520
David.

1003
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,280
>> Absolutely. We got some things to talk

1004
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,960
about. We will.

1005
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,000
>> All right. Now, you guys stick around

1006
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,160
because you want to hear this next story

1007
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,640
as well. This is our next couple's

1008
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,720
battle. Someone in our audience is about

1009
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,440
to get surprised by what was caught on

1010
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,520
tape.

1011
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,760
>> My boyfriend Roman and I made this pack

1012
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,720
to get into incredible shape together.

1013
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,040
We're an awesome couple. We motivate

1014
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,119
each other. He's got an incredible body.

1015
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,160
We just want to do this together. No

1016
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,640
chips, no cookies, no carbs. So, we made

1017
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,160
a pack. Let's do this together. Well, I

1018
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,480
feel a little betrayed right now cuz I

1019
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,599
just found some little secrets hidden in

1020
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,280
Roman's truck. Chips.

1021
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,040
Chips.

1022
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,920
Chips. More chips. This chipaholic is

1023
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,200
going to send me into a carb coma. I am

1024
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,599
so upset right now.

1025
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,119
>> Robot, you look like a gazelle. But

1026
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,359
>> did he notice coming?

1027
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,359
>> No. Are those chips yours?

1028
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,359
>> No.

1029
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,200
>> Who Who are you hiding those chips from?

1030
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,240
The dogs? I saw them back there playing.

1031
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,119
>> Yeah, I guess they gave me up. Uh, yeah.

1032
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,400
Yes, they're mine.

1033
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,839
>> They're yours.

1034
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,040
>> What kids? Why Why does it bother you so

1035
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,720
much to have the chips in the

1036
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,440
>> Because we're supposed to be doing this

1037
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,079
together as a team and getting in shape

1038
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,960
together and I want him to motivate me

1039
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,079
and

1040
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,640
>> how's he going to do that if he's

1041
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,160
sneaking junk food behind my back?

1042
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,839
>> That seems pretty innocent, but let's

1043
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,680
just talk about this. How since

1044
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,200
something as seemingly minor as hiding

1045
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,400
things from each other turn into

1046
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,160
something much more important?

1047
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,160
>> Let's ask Rev about that.

1048
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,359
Well,

1049
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,359
>> I have M&M's in my drawer. So, as far as

1050
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,680
>> last night, what happened?

1051
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,359
>> My grandson, I told him, I said, "I got

1052
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,040
some M&M's for you." She said, "No, you

1053
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,160
don't." I said, "Yes, I do." And I kind

1054
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,440
of busted myself. So, the keeping

1055
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,920
secrets,

1056
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,920
>> I'm not that good at really helping this

1057
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,040
couple because I'm him, you know?

1058
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,800
Right.

1059
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,320
>> So,

1060
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,040
>> but

1061
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,880
if it on on a on a true level, on a real

1062
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,680
level, not just on the cookies and chips

1063
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,520
level, which I I'm guilty of. Um, hiding

1064
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,240
situations from each other is not

1065
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,320
healthy. I mean, I do let her know like

1066
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,839
she'll if if I'm eating something that's

1067
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,680
wrong, I'm not really hiding that much

1068
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,599
of it. I'll just do it in her face cuz

1069
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,200
she's been off carbs for a minute and

1070
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,720
she's like, "You're eating extra carbs

1071
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,119
now. Everything's pizza and cake." Dr.

1072
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
Oz,

1073
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,520
>> at least I'm doing it in a face.

1074
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,960
>> No, Dr. Oz, I can't have carbs.

1075
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,720
>> But that you made that up, Lisa. We

1076
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,720
wasn't in it together like that.

1077
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,520
>> I didn't say I'm off carbs. I'm

1078
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,280
listening.

1079
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,800
>> You're not helping them. No, they're

1080
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,240
learning from this. This is

1081
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,280
intervention. You were the actual

1082
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,480
intervention here.

1083
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,800
>> He He He did He's not on carbs. But why

1084
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,240
do the dessert all the time now? You

1085
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,839
understand? He didn't do that before.

1086
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,320
>> Yeah. Why was the dessert now?

1087
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,839
>> I don't know. I think as she got rid of

1088
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,520
carbs out of her diet, I just got a

1089
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,040
sweet tooth out of nowhere. I don't

1090
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,119
know.

1091
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,119
So, but at least I'm not hiding it.

1092
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,920
We're at dinner. I'm like, "Give me the

1093
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,520
lava flow."

1094
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,599
>> But if I say, "Okay, now he said, give

1095
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,040
me the lava flow." Dr.

1096
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,000
>> And I said,

1097
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,480
>> he's going to help us. And so I said to

1098
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
him, well, I I don't want anything. So

1099
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,240
he, that's when he was like told the

1100
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,400
lady, "Come on over." So then when it

1101
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,839
came I said, "hm" like I was going to

1102
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,079
>> and I was like, "Oh, you're off."

1103
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,680
>> And then no, wait. Yeah. He reminds me

1104
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,960
and I said, "Yeah, but I might want

1105
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,520
something." He said, "You know what,

1106
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,040
Jess? I'm not going to get nothing."

1107
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,680
>> Oh, so it helped.

1108
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,520
>> You see what I'm saying?

1109
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,320
>> So you pulled me toward you

1110
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,920
>> by saying no.

1111
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,119
>> Yeah, but you just didn't want me.

1112
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,119
>> Did we answer that question?

1113
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,119
>> Sorry.

1114
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,480
>> Okay.

1115
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,880
>> You know what? I think you just did

1116
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,240
fine. I love you both, dearly. I hope

1117
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,200
that was helpful for you. Thanks for

1118
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,000
being with us.

1119
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,400
>> Thank you very much.

1120
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,160
>> Listen, there's a lot more of this of

1121
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,079
this in their wonderful new book, Old

1122
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,520
School Love, as always wonderfully done

1123
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,240
by this beautiful couple. And guess

1124
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,160
what? You're all going home with a copy.

1125
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,520
>> You get a copy. You get a copy. That

1126
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,520
That'll really help you. We'll be right

1127
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,520
back.

1128
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,720

1129
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,760
[Applause]

1130
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,520
>> Here's the question for everyone in the

1131
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,760
audience. I want home. Think about this.

1132
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,560
What kind of a chicken wing eater are

1133
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,680
you? Are you a one? Right. Where I don't

1134
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,920
know, took a little bite, didn't like

1135
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,640
it. I guess threes, middle of the road.

1136
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,280
Are you a five? Where you know it's just

1137
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,520
the bone barely. Audience, which of the

1138
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,480
choices are you? Let me see you. We got

1139
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,160
ones, threes, fours, fives.

1140
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
You're a one.

1141
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,680
>> Really? A one?

1142
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,480
>> A one.

1143
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,599
>> You don't like the

1144
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,640
>> I really don't eat them.

1145
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,240
>> You don't eat them.

1146
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,760
>> No.

1147
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,359
>> All right. So, what do you think of

1148
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,880
people who are ones?

1149
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,320
>> Like the lady like the lady behind you.

1150
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,000
>> They obviously don't like chicken wings.

1151
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,640
>> There's a one over here. You don't like

1152
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,480
them either?

1153
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,280
>> I like chicken, but not the bone.

1154
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,000
>> Not the bone. All right. Ones.

1155
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
>> I'm a one.

1156
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,720
>> Just one bite and let it go.

1157
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,960
>> One bite. Yep. That's it.

1158
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,560
>> I got to say, the food quiz has elicited

1159
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,880
hilarious reactions from social media.

1160
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,400
Christy Tegan tweeted, "I don't invite

1161
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,240
ones or twos back to my house." Right.

1162
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,760
Even my daughter knows better. She says,

1163
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,760
and I have to say, when I indulge in

1164
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,359
wings, I would never be a one. I got to

1165
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,400
eat everything. Just get to the five. If

1166
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,320
you like them, you like them, right? Am

1167
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,680
I right? Where are the fives here? All

1168
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,960
right. So, Annayia is a five, right? And

1169
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,640
she's joining us here. She's going to

1170
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,240
show us a technique for achieving

1171
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,680
fivedom. Are you all ready to watch for

1172
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,240
the ones out there? All right. Let me

1173
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,000
see how you do it.

1174
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,640
>> Wait, first, did he say five? That's

1175
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
hilarious. Sorry.

1176
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,079
>> Five. Five.

1177
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,359
>> So, you have to dip it first, Dr. Oz.

1178
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,599
>> Of course. Everyone, please.

1179
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,720
>> And then you

1180
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,160
work your way around.

1181
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,599
>> Mhm. M you take your time.

1182
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,599
>> Take your time

1183
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,520
>> cuz you have to savor the moment. You

1184
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,240
can't do too fast cuz then you don't

1185
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,760
taste it.

1186
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,160
>> And when you're done, it's just the

1187
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
bone.

1188
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,359
>> Just the bone.

1189
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,960
>> But from the end, you're eating it.

1190
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,920
>> Why waste time? Oh my. It's almost over.

1191
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,800
It's a four already.

1192
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,240
>> I'm a I'm a Caribbean woman. Sorry. And

1193
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,319
I tell people all the time, I thought

1194
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,760
this was the norm around the world. But

1195
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,200
to see the one

1196
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,520
>> Well, we got fours and threes around

1197
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,440
you, so you're safe. You keep your one.

1198
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,280
The power of change lies in the power of

1199
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,119
you. Just one person, one voice speaking

1200
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,839
the truth and you can all be fives.

1201
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,480
There it goes.

1202
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,800
>> There it is.

1203
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,800
>> Goodbye everybody.
