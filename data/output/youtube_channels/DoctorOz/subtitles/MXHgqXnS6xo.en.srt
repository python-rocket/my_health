2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,880
season 11 starts now.

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,760
Imagine you get into a car accident. You

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,400
look around at the wreckage and realize

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,480
your nightmare isn't over. While you

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,760
were able to walk away from the crash,

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,120
the person in the other car does not.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,960
They died at the hands of your mistake.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,040
Today, you'll meet two women who are

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,520
speaking about their secret shame after

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,800
they accidentally killed someone. What

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,520
happened when they realized another

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,520
person's life was taken at their hands?

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,160
And could they ever forgive themselves?

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,920
On a dark country road in Midland, Texas

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,199
at the wheel of her father's Chevy

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,000
Impala, Laura Bush was only 17 years old

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,640
when she ran a stop sign, crashed, and

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,119
accidentally killed her friend. That

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,680
moment, she says, has haunted her for

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,520
most of her adult life. Many other

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,360
celebrities have opened up about the

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
tremendous guilt and pain they've

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,320
suffered after accidentally taking a

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,200
life. For Venus Williams, it was the

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,240
death of a 78-year-old man after a car

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,200
crash that left her heartbroken. Rebecca

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,200
Gayhart says she didn't want to live

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,080
following her tragic car accident that

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,560
killed a 9-year-old boy.

31
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,799
An accidental killing is defined as a

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
death resulting from a perfectly lawful

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,240
act that one wouldn't expect to cause

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,720
harm. It's estimated that over 1 million

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,840
people a year cause an accidental death

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,759
or injury. And headline after headline

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,240
reveals how quickly our fragile

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,000
realities can crumble through a fatal

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,520
mishap.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,520
>> I hit and killed a young man. He was

41
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,040
just 18.

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,880
That night, the first responders

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,079
couldn't come for a while. And that was

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,960
the loneliest and saddest half hour of

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,560
my life. Then they told me that two men

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,120
had died in the accident. The accident

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,040
that I was at fault for. I didn't think

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,959
that I deserve to be on this earth. I

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,840
felt like it was a mistake that I was

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,080
alive. How can you go on after you've

51
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,680
taken two lives?

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,000
>> On September 23rd, 2018 in the Utah

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,879
Mountains, Caen Richen's life was

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,040
changed forever. That day, she and her

55
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,360
family were out target shooting. What

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,480
they didn't realize was that behind the

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,680
target they set up was a road. On that

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,800
road, another family was driving by.

59
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,080
Caen fired three shots, removed her ear

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,400
protectors, and heard screaming.

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,239
Her bullets had struck a 14-year-old boy

62
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,640
in the head, killing him instantly.

63
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,720
Today, Kaen has come to speak about the

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,920
tragic day that will haunt her forever.

65
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,239
Kaen joins me now in studio. What gives

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,519
you the strength to speak up today about

67
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,840
your story?

68
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,680
>> Um

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,959
the desire and the hope that I can

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,560
prevent future tragedies

71
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,599
and

72
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,159
just the support system that I have, my

73
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,760
husband, my children, you know, the

74
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,599
people around me. Um

75
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,280
I never want something like this to

76
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,560
happen to anybody else. And so whatever

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,400
I can do to prevent that,

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,640
you know, I'll do.

79
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,080
>> Can you take me back to that day? What

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,000
happened after you realized you pulled

81
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,120
the trigger and that something had

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,440
happened?

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
>> Well, when we first took our hearing

84
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,400
protection off, we heard the screaming.

85
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,400
And my initial thought was it was just

86
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,599
some teenagers out goofing around. And

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,280
then the jeep came flying up onto the

88
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,599
top of the hill and stopped and we could

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,080
hear what they were screaming and

90
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,599
realized what had happened.

91
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,840
Um, my four children were with us and so

92
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,319
we had them stay where they were at as

93
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,760
me and my husband ran up the hill to see

94
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,479
if there was anything we could do.

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,840
It was very obvious

96
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,960
that nothing could be done. Um, my

97
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,120
husband called 911

98
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,199
and I went back down the hill to my

99
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,360
children and took them around up to

100
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,639
where our campsite was, where we'd been

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,320
sitting, so that they didn't have to be

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,560
witness to to what had happened.

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,479
>> What went through your mind as you began

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,479
to process that this little boy had had

105
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,479
passed?

106
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,120
It's like living in a nightmare that you

107
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,120
can't wake up from.

108
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,639
Never never thought I would be in this

109
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,639
position.

110
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,680
Thank you.

111
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,759
I just I couldn't believe it had

112
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,840
happened. You know, we've always been

113
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,600
very careful.

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,199
Um, we've worked really hard at teaching

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,840
our kids gun safety

116
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:24,600
and uh, it just

117
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,600
I was in shock. I just

118
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,160
unbelievable.

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,160
>> So, in the days, weeks after the

120
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
incident, the community was in mourning

121
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,440
and obviously the story made headlines.

122
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:41,680
How did people respond to you?

123
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,280
Those who personally knew me, most of

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,759
them were very supportive. Um, there are

125
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,600
a few people that no longer associate

126
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,600
with me.

127
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Um, but there is a lot of

128
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,120
anger. You know, there are times where I

129
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,039
was out that you could hear that I could

130
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,199
hear people talking about me.

131
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
>> Mhm. Some of them knew who I was and

132
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,120
didn't realize

133
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,840
that I was there.

134
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
Um, I learned to quit answering my

135
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,400
phone. I got a lot of blocked phone

136
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,560
calls. Um, I shut off all my social

137
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,600
media because I would get messages from

138
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:27,440
people and then they would block me from

139
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,520
them. Um,

140
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,919
so you just

141
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,240
you have to learn to just ignore people.

142
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,240
you know,

143
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,479
they are allowed to feel however they

144
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,800
want. You know, they don't know the

145
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,639
story. They don't know me. Um, and if if

146
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
it makes them feel better to be angry at

147
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,199
me, then, you know, that's okay. Cuz

148
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,039
there's nothing that they can say to me

149
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,120
that I haven't said to myself.

150
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,319
>> That's tough.

151
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,160
With your guilt, you pleaded guilty

152
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,280
>> to negligent homicide.

153
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,960
>> Yes.

154
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,319
and you've said that you thought you

155
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,560
might spend the rest of your life in

156
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,919
prison. Did Did you believe that that

157
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,240
would be the right penalty for you, that

158
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,919
you deserve that?

159
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,319
Um,

160
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,759
it wasn't necessarily that I believed

161
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,599
it, but I remember sitting up on the

162
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,599
mountain while we were waiting for the

163
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,880
police to arrive, thinking that whatever

164
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:33,479
came my way, I was willing to accept

165
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,479
because I killed somebody's kid.

166
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,680
As painful is for you to say that,

167
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,759
investigators, as you know, went out to

168
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,319
the site. They determined that there's

169
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
no way you could have seen the road, nor

170
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,880
would have expected it to turn the way

171
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,440
it did from where you were standing. Did

172
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,599
that alleviate some of the pain to know

173
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,680
that at least officially people weren't

174
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,000
blaming you

175
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,319
>> a little bit?

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,199
>> So, Kayleen was sentenced to community

177
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,800
service and educating the public on gun

178
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,400
safety, although I understand the judge

179
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,120
was originally going to sentence you to

180
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,800
one day in jail for every year of the

181
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,280
child's life.

182
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,280
What have you said to the family?

183
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:21,280
>> I don't feel like I have the right to

184
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:24,560
impose on them until they're until

185
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,560
they're ready. Um, the only contact

186
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,440
we've really had is to ask them if we

187
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,440
could dedicate the presentation that I

188
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,399
do to the hunter safety groups on gun

189
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,719
safety in the video that I made in their

190
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,279
son's memory.

191
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,919
Um, but we've tried very hard to be very

192
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,680
respectful of their feelings. Um,

193
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,159
>> I'm glad you came here today.

194
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,279
>> Thank you.

195
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,800
>> So, we're going to keep talking about

196
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,880
this. Coming up, a car accident that

197
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,720
took the life of an 8-year-old boy. And

198
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,000
what the woman behind the wheel says

199
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,720
still haunts her today.

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,440
>> I live with the memory of that small,

201
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,160
broken body, and I live with the memory

202
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,240
of his mother's screams.

203
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,320
And I'll always wonder if there's

204
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
something I could have done differently

205
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,760
to avoid hitting him.

206
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,279
>> Today, we asked the heart-wrenching

207
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,200
question. What happens after you

208
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,440
accidentally kill someone? We're back

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
with Kaen who was practicing target

210
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,760
shooting and one of her stray bullets

211
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,440
hit and killed a teen boy. You just saw

212
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,760
a clip of Maryanne. She says she will

213
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,680
never forget the boy whose life she took

214
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,839
that fateful day. It's a horrifying

215
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,880
reality she's had to face for more than

216
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,360
40 years.

217
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
>> Yes.

218
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,720
>> Marian, thank you for being here. What

219
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
what happened that day that changed your

220
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,519
life forever?

221
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,680
>> At the time, I was a student living in a

222
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,519
small town in Ohio on a beautiful spring

223
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,240
day. I was driving along a country road

224
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,880
back to my student apartment when an

225
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,720
8-year-old boy named Brian darted into

226
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,040
the road. I tried to swerve, but I hit

227
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
him and he died before he reached the

228
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,080
hospital.

229
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,040
You were 22 years old when this

230
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,880
happened.

231
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,360
>> Yes, I was.

232
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,800
>> Did you ever wonder why did this have to

233
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,240
happen to me?

234
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:15,600
>> I I think I wondered that from the very

235
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:19,200
beginning and I concluded that I must be

236
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,120
a terrible person. I blamed myself.

237
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,680
Uh although I was not charged with any

238
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:29,360
offenses, I was convinced that this

239
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,120
child's death was my fault. It happened

240
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,440
in front of my car. I collided with him.

241
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,120
>> Um

242
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,839
I also struggled with pretty severe

243
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,200
trauma symptoms for quite some time.

244
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,760
horrible images that would I'd be making

245
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,920
breakfast or brushing my teeth and all

246
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,519
of a sudden a terrible image would pop

247
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,360
into my mind.

248
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,480
>> Um I was overcome with guilt and grief

249
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,079
and fear. Uh it was very difficult to

250
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:06,959
concentrate. Uh so it was a very very

251
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:09,600
difficult time and uh I definitely

252
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,360
held myself responsible.

253
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,800
It took a while, but years later you

254
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,760
wrote a a letter to the boy's mother.

255
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,360
>> Yes, I did.

256
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,640
>> Did you ever get a response?

257
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,680
>> I did. I I received a response from his

258
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,839
brother. His mother had passed away.

259
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,920
>> And the brother and I have had a number

260
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,800
of conversations

261
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,880
which I believe have been very healing

262
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,000
and helpful for both of us. And I'm

263
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:43,120
pretty awed by his generosity of spirit.

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,800
It's it's a gift and a bit of grace. Um

265
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:51,200
I I will say people ask me all the time

266
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:54,480
about contacting the family of the

267
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,680
victim that they unintentionally killed.

268
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,959
And what I tell them is if they are

269
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,760
hoping for forgiveness or some

270
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,000
understanding or some reconciliation,

271
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,279
they're probably not ready to make that

272
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,440
approach because they don't really, in

273
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,800
my opinion, have the right to ask for

274
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,639
that from their victim. But when their

275
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,040
healing has progressed to a point that

276
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,920
they could just speak from the heart and

277
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,600
say, "Your son, your partner, your

278
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,160
spouse lives with me, is in my heart,

279
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,560
and I just want you to know that um

280
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,839
because I know he's in your heart, too."

281
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,240
That can be very beautiful and powerful.

282
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,839
>> So, there are about 20,000 people in

283
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,760
this country who accidentally kill

284
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,120
someone else. It's not that rare,

285
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
>> right? And I've taken care of lots of

286
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,160
folks in my life who felt responsible

287
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
for the deaths of others.

288
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,920
>> Sure.

289
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
>> Sometimes it's people who are in a car

290
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,720
accident. Sometimes police officers

291
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
taking

292
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,440
>> trying to keep the place safe.

293
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,959
Healthcare providers, right?

294
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,200
>> When patients don't do well,

295
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,639
>> right?

296
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,320
>> And what I've noticed, I don't know if

297
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,839
if your research has shown this, that is

298
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,680
there's a deep sense of quiet of

299
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,200
solemnness that happens

300
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,440
>> and and you know, you've been listening

301
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,920
to Kaen's story. What's your message of

302
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,160
hope for her? Because I I I feel a deep

303
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,399
sense of darkness in you, Kaen. And I'd

304
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,040
probably feel it's been how many days or

305
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,639
months since that child died?

306
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,320
>> 16 months in one day.

307
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,600
>> And you have children that are similar

308
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,320
age.

309
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,880
>> I have four children between the ages of

310
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,880
11 and 18.

311
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,760
>> Okay. Kayen,

312
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,880
this tragic shooting

313
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,519
will change you, but it doesn't need to

314
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,880
define you. You're so much more than

315
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,480
that. And I don't think anybody could

316
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,600
have watched and listened to your

317
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,480
interview with Dr. Oz and not recognized

318
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,279
that you're a very caring and thoughtful

319
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,519
person and also very brave for coming

320
00:13:51,279 --> 00:14:00,560
out here and telling your story.

321
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:02,399
I want to invite you to

322
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,320
honor

323
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,320
that young boy who died too young in the

324
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,399
choices you make going forward. You've

325
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,199
already started to do that with your gun

326
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,920
safety activism and that's very

327
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,199
beautiful. What I find is that when

328
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,959
unintentional killers reach out to other

329
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,279
people, they actually heal themselves

330
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,880
even as they're helping others because

331
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,120
we regain our self-respect, a sense of

332
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,120
ourselves as good people that we've

333
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:38,800
lost. We regain trust in ourselves in

334
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,920
the world. and we regain a sense of

335
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,120
acceptance. We're no longer disconnected

336
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,600
from the people around us. We're part of

337
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,480
a community and we're helping to make

338
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,040
that community a safer, kinder, more

339
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,959
compassionate place. So, that's my

340
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,240
invitation to you. I think you're

341
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,600
already on that journey. I have every

342
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,240
confidence in your ability to succeed

343
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,000
and um I wish you peace.

344
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,279
>> Thank you. You're welcome.

345
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,199
>> Sen, what will it take for you to

346
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,199
forgive yourself and find some bit of

347
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,199
peace?

348
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:22,279
>> Right now,

349
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,279
I don't know that it's

350
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,360
I don't know that the forgiveness will

351
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,600
ever truly come. I think it's more

352
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,440
acceptance

353
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,040
and

354
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,000
moving forward, you know, so that it's

355
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,440
not defining me, so that I'm making a

356
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,480
difference

357
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,199
>> in other people's lives.

358
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,959
My whole purpose now is to make sure

359
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,040
that nobody else goes through this.

360
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,120
>> I wish you the best going forward. I

361
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
know it's a long road. Thank you very

362
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,160
much.

363
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,959
>> Thank you.

364
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,959
>> We'll be right back.

365
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,959
Coming up, medical mysteries that will

366
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,600
shock you. What would you do if your

367
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,759
skin looked like fish scales all over

368
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,560
your body? Or could you be allergic to

369
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,560
something so vital to life as water?

370
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,850
Medical cases that will baffle you.

371
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,929
That's next.

372
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,929
[Music]

373
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
We're back. Investigating medical

374
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,560
mysteries. Imagine your skin feels and

375
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,440
looks like this. scales that look like

376
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,360
they're from a fish all over your body.

377
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,759
You're covered with thick, dry scales

378
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,839
that peel off to become painful cracks

379
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,079
on your body's biggest organ. Today, we

380
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,320
investigate the medical mystery of what

381
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,279
could cause skin to blister, peel, and

382
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,000
shed so visibly and so intensely. For

383
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,440
one woman, she says her skin gets so dry

384
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,199
that her eyelids flip out. Take a look

385
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,320
at what she goes through every day just

386
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,959
to get out of the house.

387
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,560
I am totally not a morning person, but

388
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,240
this is the most important part of my

389
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,279
day because it sets the tone for my

390
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,439
skin. So, I always start with eye drops.

391
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,319
Um, just keep my eyes hydrated so they

392
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:13,120
don't close all the way. How would I

393
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,919
describe my skin? Rough, dry,

394
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,240
flaky, and peely. Broken because it

395
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,799
doesn't do what it's supposed to do. One

396
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,880
of the things with my condition is I

397
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,360
always have to carry lotion around and

398
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,839
my skin also sheds so I have to be

399
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,799
constantly sweeping.

400
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,520
Growing up different was definitely a

401
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,000
challenge emotionally. I felt most

402
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,799
people saw my skin first instead of

403
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,360
getting to know who I am. I began to

404
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,640
feel worthless and less than all because

405
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,080
of my skin.

406
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,160
>> I'm so happy that you're here. May I

407
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,039
touch your hand? Yes, absolutely. Thank

408
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,320
you for having me.

409
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,679
>> Thank you for being here. So, please

410
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,559
share with everybody the name of your

411
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
condition.

412
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,360
>> Yes, it's called lamelariosis

413
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,039
and basically my body sheds old skin

414
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,679
cells off too slow and that's what

415
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,000
causes the dry flaky scales.

416
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,080
>> Lamelichthosis.

417
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
>> So, you can tell when your skin is

418
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
starting to dry out. What does that mean

419
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,600
you have to do? What does it feel like?

420
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,720
It basically it starts out feeling more

421
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,039
itchy than normal and it'll start

422
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,200
actually feeling tight and maybe a

423
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,120
little tender and that's how I know I

424
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,039
need to reapply the lotion.

425
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,160
>> So I notice your skin and you you point

426
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,160
out in that piece it's the first thing

427
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,679
people see and one does notice. I

428
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,400
noticed your eyes first by the way which

429
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,880
are beautiful.

430
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,720
>> Thank you.

431
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,360
>> But may I may I examine your hands?

432
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,679
>> Absolutely.

433
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,320
>> So this is pretty typical the scaling.

434
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,760
>> Mhm.

435
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,760
>> And it doesn't hurt when I touch it.

436
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,320
>> No, not at all.

437
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,240
I actually don't mind when people aren't

438
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,240
afraid to touch me because so much of my

439
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,120
life people wouldn't touch things I

440
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,480
touched. So,

441
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,559
>> well, I'll keep holding your hands then.

442
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,919
>> Sure.

443
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,200
>> What What was that like as a child

444
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,760
having people I'm sure they had

445
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,600
nicknames for you and they unfounded

446
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,640
fears and they judge you based on what

447
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,120
you look like. Something you couldn't

448
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,080
change.

449
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,640
>> Oh, absolutely. When I was little, it

450
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,200
was a huge challenge because you just

451
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,200
want to fit in. You want to belong. And

452
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,720
when I started school, parents actually

453
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
called the principal and wanted their

454
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,520
kids taken out of my class.

455
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,760
>> The parents called?

456
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,000
>> Yes. I think they were afraid it was

457
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,559
contagious, which it is not.

458
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,480
>> And as a result, um, it the kids, I

459
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,679
think, were afraid of it then because

460
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,080
their parents were.

461
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,919
>> Sure.

462
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,240
>> And when I actually started school, they

463
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,880
wouldn't touch things I touched. I was

464
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,200
bullied by exclusion. always kind of

465
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,440
left out on the outside looking in is

466
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,440
how I often felt. I get stared at

467
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,120
everywhere, too. And I know it's just

468
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,520
something that people aren't used to

469
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,600
seeing. So, it's their natural reaction,

470
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,960
but that's hard, too, when you're

471
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,640
constantly being stared at.

472
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,240
>> Well, it's it's your largest organ. Just

473
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,600
to put in context, I know you know, but

474
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
for everybody else, we probably have 20

475
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,240
square feet of skin. That's like a a

476
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
small bathroom worth on the floor of

477
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,679
skin. It's a lot of skin, right?

478
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,880
Protects us from germs. Is vitally

479
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,160
important to how we feel things and

480
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,559
touch things. how we perceived by

481
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,760
others. And so the emotional side's one

482
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,799
part of it, and I want to come back to

483
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,799
that in a second, but the physical part

484
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,320
is really important. And for example,

485
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,520
regulating your body temperature is

486
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,039
probably a challenge because I don't

487
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,440
know, do you sweat normally through the

488
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,039
skin?

489
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,919
>> I actually cannot sweat.

490
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,320
>> You can't sweat at all.

491
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,080
>> No.

492
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,919
>> So, how do you deal? That's dangerous.

493
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,840
>> It is. It's actually life-threatening.

494
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,919
Something as simple as a fever, I could

495
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,160
actually die from.

496
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,520
So, thankfully, I haven't had one in

497
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,919
many, many years. But I basically carry

498
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,520
around a spray bottle that I fill with

499
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,760
water and I call it my fake sweat.

500
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,000
>> Do I see it there? Yeah.

501
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,280
>> And what it does is it acts as my body's

502
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,320
way of sweating.

503
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,240
>> So this is a it's dangerous actually.

504
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,679
You're brave that you grow up as with a

505
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
problem that you probably were aware at

506
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,640
young age could be lethal to you.

507
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,919
>> Mhm.

508
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,919
>> One of the things that's get that's

509
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,120
amazing to me is some of these this is a

510
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,320
genetic abnormality. Correct.

511
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,159
>> So not something you could have done or

512
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,760
changed. We don't have a cure for it. It

513
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,200
can happen to any skin tone,

514
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,880
>> right? And the condition is something

515
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,880
that most folks don't understand. So, if

516
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,400
you want to spend two seconds explaining

517
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
it, let me give a little background.

518
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,600
When children are born with this

519
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,400
condition, uh they have this little

520
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
translucent uh film almost. This is what

521
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,880
you look like as a baby. Yes.

522
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,760
>> Which I think is really cute.

523
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,280
>> My grandma said I almost looked like uh

524
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,679
when I was born with a collodian

525
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,000
membrane, I was almost like I was a

526
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,200
sausage link cuz you have like that

527
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,480
thing around you.

528
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,720
>> Exactly. The casing. Yeah.

529
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,559
>> Right. And then the membrane is replaced

530
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,520
by the thicker scaly skin as you get

531
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,960
older and emotionally

532
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,400
from the first moment you can remember

533
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,720
life all the things that you mentioned

534
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,640
which are processing so beautifully now

535
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,600
>> is you know was still was there and it's

536
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,880
hard to do that. How did you cope

537
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,640
emotionally? How did you get to this

538
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,320
point as as a as I don't know I I'll use

539
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,720
the word healthy as you appear balanced

540
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,360
as you appear. It's definitely been a

541
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,360
huge transformation and people who know

542
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,080
me now, they find it hard to believe

543
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,240
that I used to be shy and insecure, but

544
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,159
it was kind of three-fold. One is

545
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,039
definitely my faith because I believe

546
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,360
God creates everyone in his image and

547
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:08,320
the very things that we often see as

548
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,720
flaws are the things he's going to use

549
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,679
to impact the world in a big way.

550
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,760
>> Beautifully said.

551
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,120
>> Thank you.

552
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,120
And secondly is the performing arts. I

553
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,440
remember my first dance show. I was far

554
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,760
enough away from the audience that for

555
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,480
the first time in my life, people saw me

556
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,200
as Bailey the dancer instead of Bailey

557
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,360
the girl with the weird skin. And then

558
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,520
the third, and everyone struggles with

559
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,000
insecurities. I'm sure you have them as

560
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,799
well.

561
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,559
>> Absolutely.

562
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,799
>> And when you look in the mirror every

563
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,320
day, you have a choice.

564
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:44,559
And you could choose to believe all the

565
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,240
things that the world tends to say is

566
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,799
beautiful and you have to fit into the

567
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,320
certain mold. Or you could choose that

568
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,039
you're beautifully unique just the way

569
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,280
you are. And life is so much better when

570
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,520
you choose the second route.

571
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,559
>> So you you redefine beauty.

572
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,240
>> Yes.

573
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,720
>> Bailey's beautiful now.

574
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,240
>> Yes. Well, I always have been beautiful.

575
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
>> Yes. You always Exactly. Now you realize

576
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,600
you're beautiful.

577
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,880
>> Now I realize it. I'm owning it. for you

578
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,880
have the power of one which we've been

579
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,480
talking about on the show a lot. You

580
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,760
have a strong voice. You use it. You

581
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,200
speak the truth and you're going to

582
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,520
change a lot of lives by doing that.

583
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,559
>> Thank you.

584
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
>> Bless you for coming to our show.

585
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,760
>> Thank you so much.

586
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,360
>> Up next, a medical mystery that is

587
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,640
baffling. Can you be allergic to

588
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,080
something that all of life depends on?

589
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,559
Water.

590
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,559
>> We'll be right back.

591
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,880
>> It was a relationship that ended very

592
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,440
poorly. Tried to ruin my life. revenge

593
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,440
porn.

594
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,760
>> Not only were there topless photos of

595
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,799
me, but they had added a Google map to

596
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,039
my location.

597
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,039
>> Oh my. That's coming up on Thursday.

598
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,280
>> We're back investigating medical

599
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,039
mysteries. Water, it's vital for

600
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,919
survival. But what if every time you

601
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,159
took a sip

602
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,559
of water or showered or got caught in

603
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,960
the rain, your skin became red, itchy,

604
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:10,080
and felt like it was on fire? My next

605
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,039
guest says her body rejects water, and

606
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,880
even a drop of water can put her at

607
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,159
risk.

608
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,120
>> I see water as an obstacle in my life.

609
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,279
I'm literally allergic to water.

610
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,760
So, if I'm externally exposed to it,

611
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,000
there will be hives and rashes. And

612
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,679
internally, I will have abdominal

613
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,520
cramping and migraines and fevers.

614
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,039
Foods with high water content, like

615
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,960
fruits and vegetables, can be pretty

616
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,880
painful for me to eat. I've even

617
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,039
recorded the sound of my stomach when

618
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,039
it's cramping.

619
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
Things as simple as washing my hands is

620
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,799
painful. Brushing my teeth really hurts.

621
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,960
I honestly only shower about one to two

622
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,200
times a month now.

623
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,200
Dehydration is a pretty constant symptom

624
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,080
of mine. I've even been admitted to the

625
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,520
ER on multiple occasions.

626
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,279
Having a chronic condition with

627
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,640
invisible symptoms can be really

628
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,039
challenging because there's a lot of

629
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,640
discrimination. I've even had a woman

630
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,240
accuse me of faking my disability.

631
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,159
There's so much that I can't do because

632
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,320
of my condition. My body is just

633
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,279
fighting a battle with itself and it

634
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,279
environment.

635
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,919
Tessa joins us via Zoom. Tessa, thanks

636
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,120
for being with us. Let's go back to the

637
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,039
very beginning. This started when you

638
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,640
were about eight years old, pretty

639
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,720
young. What kinds of symptoms did you

640
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,640
first notice?

641
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,640
>> Um, I first started noticing I had

642
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,559
really big rashes all over my body when

643
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,000
I would step out of the shower. So, at

644
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,320
first we thought maybe I could be

645
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,640
allergic to my shampoos or my soap or

646
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,360
body wash, but it just kept coming back

647
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,039
to water. It was in lake water, oceans,

648
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,919
rain water, even just my own sweat and

649
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,520
tears.

650
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,200
>> So, how did the doctors pinpoint that

651
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,559
your body was reacting in fact to the

652
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,640
water that you mentioned? I mean, it's

653
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,039
so essential to life. I I'd never heard

654
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,640
of it before I heard, but your story.

655
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,320
>> Yeah, most people have not heard of it.

656
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,960
It was pretty hard to diagnose. It took

657
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,880
us a few years. It started with just

658
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,480
eliminating food allergies and

659
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,960
eliminating allergies to anything else

660
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,120
I'd be coming into contact with. But a

661
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,039
water allergy test is super simple. You

662
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,640
just get a towel, soak it in room

663
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,559
temperature water, and lay it over your

664
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
upper limb, and within about 20 minutes,

665
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,919
you'll see a reaction.

666
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,679
>> So, what was your reaction when they

667
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,320
actually made this diagnosis of a water

668
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,760
allergy? It's so so jarring.

669
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,360
>> Yeah, I was I was a kid. I was only 8 to

670
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,559
10 years old when this was happening.

671
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,320
And I was kind of in denial of it. I

672
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,000
didn't really know what was going on, so

673
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,240
I didn't really know how to accept it.

674
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,799
And I would lie about my condition to

675
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,720
people, to friends. I would say it was

676
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,320
my asthma. It wasn't something

677
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,320
underlying from that. So, I really

678
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,919
didn't accept it until I was older.

679
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,760
>> It does sound unbelievable. And just for

680
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,840
everyone listening, since I've read up

681
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,279
on it, it appears around puberty. We're

682
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,320
not sure why it happens. One theory, by

683
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,400
the way, is that the water actually

684
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,200
activates something on your skin or in

685
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,720
your body. And Tessa gave us you thank

686
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,400
you for sharing your medical records and

687
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,919
medical records actually

688
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,919
>> demonstrate this. It's a rare case

689
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,600
what's called aquagenic erdicaria.

690
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,360
Aquagenic is water and herdicaria is

691
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,720
hives. So basically, you're allergic to

692
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,159
water. It's real. Yeah.

693
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,360
>> And in your case, you say that you're

694
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,880
allergic both externally and internally.

695
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,279
So which means you can't even drink

696
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,760
water. So how do you stay hydrated?

697
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,720
>> I I try to stay hydrated using whole

698
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,400
milk. Um the fats and proteins and sugar

699
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,720
found in whole milk actually help kind

700
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,799
of like sneak the water molecules into

701
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,720
my system. But even my level of

702
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,320
hydration is probably everybody else's

703
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,760
level of dehydration.

704
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,159
>> Yeah. I mean, it's hard to avoid water,

705
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,799
right? It makes up 60% of our bodies as

706
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,799
well.

707
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,760
>> So they can ask of a personal question

708
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,279
here.

709
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,360
>> Many are probably thinking how do you

710
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,840
shower, right? Because that that must

711
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,039
affect your body adversely. How often do

712
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,760
you shower?

713
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,600
>> I only shower about one to two times a

714
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,399
month right now.

715
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,120
>> And and what happens when you do shower?

716
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,360
>> I even in cold water, I will get a fever

717
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,080
within about 5 minutes of stepping into

718
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,000
it. I will exit the shower with hives

719
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,520
pretty much all over my body and I have

720
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
to rest for about an hour or two

721
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,880
afterwards.

722
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,559
>> I would only shower once a month or less

723
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,000
too personally.

724
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,480
>> All right. So, what what about if you're

725
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,559
outside playing and it starts to rain.

726
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,559
>> If it starts to rain, I will do anything

727
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,480
I can to get inside. Whenever I'm in

728
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,320
rain, I will get a fever and a migraine

729
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,080
and it's really awful. But if I have to

730
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,720
go out in the rain, I have an umbrella

731
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,880
built for like four people that I will

732
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,679
hunker down underneath to try to stay

733
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,679
dry.

734
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,440
>> Well, I I I tell you I commend your

735
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,039
resilience and for being able to smile

736
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,159
about it, then keep hanging in there.

737
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,679
This is what I think we'll find a cure

738
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,200
for. You just got to figure out exactly

739
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,399
what's going down.

740
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,080
>> Yeah, I hope so.

741
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,120
>> Stay out of the rain. Thanks for sharing

742
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,120
your story. We'll be right back.

743
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,440
>> Coming up, children who say they've

744
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,760
lived past lives. Could this boy have

745
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,760
lived a past life of baseball legend Lou

746
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Garrick?

747
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,520
[Applause]

748
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,480
Today we investigate the phenomenon of

749
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,720
past lives and the children who say

750
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,200
they've lived them. Like a toddler who

751
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,480
told his parents he once lived a past

752
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,480
life as a Civil War soldier. or a

753
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,200
10-year-old who says he had a past life

754
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,360
as a Hollywood agent in the 1950s with

755
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,760
lots of details. And you're about to

756
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,480
meet a boy who says he lived a past life

757
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,360
as someone who died nearly 70 years

758
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,279
before he was born. Baseball legend Lou

759
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,120
Garrick. Please welcome Christian and

760
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,600
his mother Kathy. Thank you both for

761
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
being here.

762
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,559
>> Thank you.

763
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,320
>> So Ky, take me back when this all

764
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,520
started. Christian was 2 years old. So I

765
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,640
don't know if you even know this.

766
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,240
Probably most kids don't remember when

767
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,080
they're two. What was so unique about

768
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,880
your son that also caught your

769
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,200
attention?

770
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,399
>> Well, we're not baseball people and he

771
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,320
saw some neighborhood kids playing

772
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,480
baseball in the neighborhood and became

773
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,000
so obsessed with baseball that he had us

774
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,240
playing baseball with him like 8 to 10

775
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,240
hours a day. Um, we put some videos on

776
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,240
YouTube and they got like 10 million

777
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,840
views and still these videos of him when

778
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,000
he was 2, three, four years old get

779
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,360
millions of views like every year still

780
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,720
10 years later.

781
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,399
>> It's a good throw. You're a lefty which

782
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,799
is an advantage. Yeah.

783
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,240
>> So, Christian started making comments at

784
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,679
the same time that he started playing.

785
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,960
And Kathy, this is probably something

786
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,320
you'll remember more than he would. And

787
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,440
I gather you were in a plane one day and

788
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,240
he said something that stopped you in

789
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,520
your tracks.

790
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,960
>> Right. In the very beginning, I didn't

791
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,399
think much of it. He would say strange

792
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,799
things like, "I was a tall baseball

793
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,679
player."

794
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,039
>> He'd say in the past tense.

795
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,120
>> He would say past tense, but I would

796
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,200
correct him. So, when he was 2 years

797
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,960
old, Adam Sandler saw him on YouTube and

798
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,559
flew us to Boston to be in a movie. And

799
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,840
while we were on the plane, I was trying

800
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,159
to put his seatelts on, and he was

801
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,679
struggling with me. and he said, "I

802
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,399
didn't wear seat belts when I was big

803
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,679
and and I drank alcohol and even then I

804
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,200
didn't think much of it. It was a little

805
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,520
embarrassing. People were laughing."

806
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,640
>> Yeah.

807
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,480
>> Um but it really when he turned three is

808
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,799
when the floodgates really opened and he

809
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,120
began sharing very specific details,

810
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,080
things that he hadn't had any access to

811
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,480
that information.

812
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,600
>> One I know is happened when he saw a

813
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,960
picture of this gentleman. I'll put it

814
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,520
up there if you don't mind. This is

815
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,720
baseball legend Babe Ruth. So Christian,

816
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,320
how did you react when you saw that

817
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,559
picture? When I saw it, I got very

818
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,880
furious and I wo my bat up in the air

819
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,320
and I told my mom, "I don't like him. He

820
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,080
was mean to me."

821
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,200
>> We were at Finway Park when he saw that.

822
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,640
He was too Yeah.

823
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,720
>> Yeah. That's That's a weird thing. Babe

824
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,039
Ruth had played in Boston initially.

825
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
>> Yeah.

826
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,480
>> So, had you ever talked to mentioned

827
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,080
Babe Ruth? You talk about baseball

828
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,600
history at all with your son?

829
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,080
>> Not at all. We weren't baseball people.

830
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,320
His dad's from Germany, so not at all.

831
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,039
>> And so, you just thought this is a wild

832
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,559
imagination of a young child growing,

833
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,720
>> right? I really did in the beginning,

834
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,720
but then as time went on, he got so

835
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,320
specific and shared just very specific

836
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,640
things about playing baseball in the

837
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,360
1920s and 30s. Um, he was able to

838
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,080
recognize people in photographs and name

839
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,600
some people. Um, so it just the more

840
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,360
that these details came out, I realized

841
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,559
there was no possible way that he could

842
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,640
just be making it up.

843
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,919
>> So you started asking around for advice

844
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,960
about what might be going on with your

845
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,799
son. What did you learn?

846
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,720
>> Right. Well, reincarnation is not part

847
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,559
of my belief system being a Christian.

848
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,880
Um I went to my pastor and the first

849
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,120
thing he said was maybe he's you know

850
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,960
possessed by an unwelcome spirit like a

851
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,320
spirit of a dead person

852
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,200
>> which as a mother that's very

853
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,440
disconcerting

854
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,120
>> scary right so then I took a very

855
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,480
scientific approach which you'll

856
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,559
appreciate I went to the University of

857
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,919
Virginia School of Medicine and got in

858
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,240
contact with researchers there who've

859
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,080
been researching children's past lives

860
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,679
um for the last 50 years they've

861
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,039
documented o almost um 3,000 cases and

862
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,880
what they told me to do is show them

863
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,559
photographs from Babe Ruth's era because

864
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,840
we knew he was upset by Babe Ruth. We

865
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,159
knew some things he had said that would

866
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,519
be cons consistent with that era like

867
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,720
when he grew up he said there was fire

868
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,000
in the lights like gaslighting. Um so I

869
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,679
showed him some pictures and

870
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,360
>> the gas lighting from the 20s.

871
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,760
>> Yeah. Well this was early Yeah. early

872
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,919
1900s. Yeah. Well in the house too.

873
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,559
>> So Kathy showed this picture of Turan.

874
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,640
This is a 1927 Yankees. Maybe the best

875
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,559
team to ever play baseball. And Babe

876
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,480
Ruth is in this picture. He's top row

877
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,120
third from the left. Christian, what did

878
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,320
your mom What did you say to your mom

879
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,760
when you saw this picture? Were you

880
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
surprised by it? Could you find yourself

881
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,240
in it?

882
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,720
>> Yeah. I I immediately pointed to a guy

883
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,480
with dimples and I said, "That was me."

884
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,240
>> It's a guy in the top left. We circle

885
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,960
him. That's That's Lou Garri.

886
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,399
>> Yeah.

887
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,360
>> And at the time, we didn't even know who

888
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,640
it was. But

889
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,640
>> what was that like actually hearing your

890
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,640
son at least be able to put some

891
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,279
language behind what he was trying to

892
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,880
tell you?

893
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,120
>> Yeah. I was grateful at the time that I

894
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,399
had Dr. Tucker and Carol Bowman who's

895
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,760
another expert in the field because they

896
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,679
said continue to show him photos. So I

897
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,200
showed him photos of of L Garri's

898
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,919
parents. He was able to pick out the

899
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,559
names from a list of names. Um it was

900
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,919
strange. It was definitely um strange as

901
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,440
a mother, but I really wanted to listen

902
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,360
to him and be there for him.

903
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,919
>> Do do you remember that picture being

904
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,799
taken or details about what was going on

905
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,039
then?

906
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,320
>> No, not too much.

907
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,240
>> But you felt pretty comfortable picking

908
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,559
out that person, Lou Garry.

909
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,799
>> Yeah.

910
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,559
>> In the image. So, there probably some

911
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,519
folks out there thinking, Kathy, you

912
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,120
know, you you're you're feeding your son

913
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,559
this information. There's just no way.

914
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,399
What do you say to those skeptics?

915
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,559
>> Well, I was the most skeptical of all.

916
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,159
And um you know, the only reason we're

917
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,599
really sharing the story now is not to

918
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,040
convince people of reincarnation, but

919
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,520
really just to share that message that

920
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,599
our souls survive death. Um that love

921
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,520
can surpass one lifetime. And I really

922
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,159
feel like if we can start to see people

923
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,000
as souls within a body rather than, you

924
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,919
know, this physical body representation

925
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,800
of who we are, we can have a lot more

926
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,960
compassion. Um, a lot be a lot just less

927
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,639
judgmental. And, um, I think really the

928
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,240
world needs that right now. So,

929
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,359
>> for sure it needs that. But I'm really

930
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,960
curious what's going on with you

931
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,560
Christians. So, when we come back, the

932
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,399
chilling memory Christian says he

933
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,720
remembers from his past life as Lou

934
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:45,399
Garry. Plus, could you have a past life

935
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,399
and not know it? Stick around.

936
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:51,040
[Applause]

937
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,960
It was a relationship that ended very

938
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,079
poorly. Tried to ruin my life.

939
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,079
>> Revenge porn.

940
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,400
>> Not only were there topless photos of

941
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,440
me, but they had added a Google map to

942
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,680
my location.

943
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,680
>> Oh my. That's coming up on Thursday.

944
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,960
>> Yeah.

945
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,440
>> Made the cast. We've been talking about

946
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,280
children who say they lived past lives.

947
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,359
Christian says he once lived a past life

948
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,359
is Lou Garri. He's back along with his

949
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,000
mother Kathy. Also joining us is medium

950
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,000
Anna Ramandi who trained past life

951
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,119
regression therapists. So you know a lot

952
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,640
about this. So Christian, you started

953
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,400
having memories when you were two. Yeah.

954
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,720
>> What is the first memory you have

955
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,240
personally of the past life?

956
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,400
>> Well, when I was little, I used to tell

957
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,480
my parents like things. I was a tall

958
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,560
baseball player and that I stayed in

959
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,200
hotels almost every night and stuff like

960
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,119
that. What did it feel like to have

961
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,119
those sensations, those visions, those

962
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,480
memories? Did it ever frighten you?

963
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,720
>> No, not really. But it was strange

964
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,320
because

965
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,839
>> you'd never seen those really. You just

966
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,720
sort of felt that they were part of you.

967
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,839
>> Mhm.

968
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,240
>> And you're 11 now.

969
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,000
>> Yeah.

970
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,480
>> Are you still having those memories?

971
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,240
>> No. As when I turned six, they started

972
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,560
slowly fading away. And that's what

973
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,160
usually happens with past life memories.

974
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,680
>> And your mom is taking you to hospitals

975
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,320
to talk to doctors about this.

976
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
>> Yeah.

977
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
>> And so you've learned a fair amount

978
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,320
about it. Does it bother you you don't

979
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,200
have those memories anymore or you're

980
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,599
okay moving on?

981
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,200
>> I'm okay moving on.

982
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,920
>> And what makes Christian's story so

983
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,000
unique?

984
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,520
>> A couple of things. First of all, he

985
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,320
remembers so vividly and specifics. You

986
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,880
know, often kids will talk about past

987
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,119
lives, but it's they kind of the drop in

988
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,359
memories and then they're out. He lived

989
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,240
with this. He felt it. This was me.

990
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,079
Also, Lou Garriig is not gone very long,

991
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,000
you know, and to have a soul that is

992
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,680
shared with someone famous who hasn't

993
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,160
been gone very long is also quite

994
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,079
unique.

995
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,680
>> Yeah. It's not Caesar or Cleopatra.

996
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,200
Someone who's, you know, people remember

997
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,480
being alive with with

998
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,560
>> Lou Gary. So, if you can give us a quick

999
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,359
insight about what reincarnation really

1000
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,520
is.

1001
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,000
>> Well, you know, our bodies die and it

1002
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,560
goes to dust, but the soul goes on

1003
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,040
forever. And so when we die, the energy

1004
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,680
of the soul, the soul has vibration, you

1005
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,160
know, goes on and the soul has an

1006
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,880
opportunity to write some of the wrongs

1007
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,359
it did in a past life. And so the to the

1008
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,119
soul will come back and, you know,

1009
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,920
occupy another body.

1010
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,800
>> And is it common that a child will lose

1011
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,839
this ability to experience a past life

1012
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,520
as they get older?

1013
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,000
>> Yeah, there's an open window between

1014
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,359
birth and sex. Um, you know, usually

1015
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,680
around six, kids are becoming

1016
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,359
socialized. they, you know, they're and

1017
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,400
they're becoming their own selves, okay?

1018
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,079
And they tend to forget about, you know,

1019
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,000
what their past life was. I mean, you

1020
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,119
can see like, well, babies will point

1021
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,520
and talk and they can't communicate, but

1022
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,240
um they're seeing and feeling and then

1023
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,680
it goes.

1024
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,960
>> Are you picking up anything? I'm not

1025
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,440
putting pressure on you, but I'm just

1026
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,520
sitting here.

1027
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,839
>> A couple of things. Um, first of all,

1028
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,320
there's a man here named Richard.

1029
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,119
Richard,

1030
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,480
>> it's my dad.

1031
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,480
>> Um, who says

1032
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,520
>> he goes to all the games. All the games.

1033
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,680
and he's with a younger female um uh

1034
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,240
Chris. Um he's with her. They go to your

1035
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,240
games.

1036
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,040
>> My stepsister who passed away is named

1037
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,280
Kristen.

1038
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
>> Okay.

1039
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,880
>> And my dad's named Richard Bird. Richard

1040
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,760
Bird is my father. And he passed away

1041
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
passed from Alzheimer's.

1042
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,119
>> They go to all your games.

1043
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,200
>> And he played baseball with him before.

1044
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,000
>> But he loves that you have become your

1045
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,160
own. Like you're not it's it's your

1046
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,359
Christian now. But I'm also feeling Babe

1047
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,040
Ruth. Okay. Not Lou Garri. Babe Ruth

1048
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,599
because he wants to set the record

1049
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,960
straight. He's sorry and he wants you to

1050
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,440
let that go. I'm

1051
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,200
>> gonna cry. And and I'm the reason I'm

1052
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,800
emotional is because he still has issues

1053
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,800
with Babe Ruth at this age. He still

1054
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,040
doesn't really like him because of a

1055
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,280
past thing. So it really touches me that

1056
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,640
you

1057
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
>> Yeah, you got to let it go. Don't hold

1058
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,599
it anymore.

1059
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,240
>> Boy, he's a he's a complex character.

1060
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,480
>> He's beautiful.

1061
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,160
>> May not let it go with Babe Ruth or you

1062
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,000
may not remember L Garri, but I

1063
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,720
understand you're a lefty, which L Garri

1064
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,119
was also.

1065
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,119
>> Yep.

1066
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,920
>> Yes, he batted lefty. So can you throw

1067
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,040
left-handed?

1068
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,359
>> Yeah. Well,

1069
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,480
>> yeah.

1070
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,839
>> I'm taking my ring off because I've

1071
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,359
learned long ago, don't wear any rings.

1072
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,720
You guys throw it over here. Let's see

1073
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,240
what you got.

1074
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,880
>> Gonna have you throw it a break.

1075
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,320
Literally. All right. Hit the glove.

1076
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,359
>> I got the children's glove, by the way.

1077
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,880
Here.

1078
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,839
>> I'm not moving it.

1079
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,400
>> All right. Let's see what you got,

1080
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,000
Tiger.

1081
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,160
Jeez.

1082
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,320
All right. Throw us one more time. Put

1083
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,720
it down here, coach.

1084
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,079
There we are. Well, it's the best I can

1085
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,800
do with this glove. Christian, thank you

1086
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,000
very much. Thank you.

1087
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,079
>> You can hear more of Christian's story

1088
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
in the book, The Boy Who Knew Too Much,

1089
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,000
an astounding true story of a young

1090
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,440
boy's past life memories. We'll be right

1091
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,720
back. Best shot.

1092

[Music]

1094
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,760
>> This next story is going to give you all

1095
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,560
the feels guaranteed. This mama

1096
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,040
Chihuahua Rosa gave birth to a premature

1097
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,720
litter. And tragically, none of them

1098
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,240
survived.

1099
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,240
But that's not the end of the story. I

1100
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,240
wouldn't have told it because Rosa was

1101
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,760
in the process of being rescued and

1102
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,040
that's when an amazing thing happened.

1103
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,640
It's a little bit of serendipity.

1104
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,720
Joining us now via Zoom to tell us more

1105
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,119
about it is Rachel Merro, the executive

1106
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,000
director from Secondhand Hounds. So

1107
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,000
Rachel, why while Mama Rosa, who lost

1108
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,400
her pops, was in transit on the way to

1109
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,480
your rescue, your phone rang again. What

1110
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,200
was that call about?

1111
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,400
It was a call from an Indian reservation

1112
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,200
and they had two five two week old baby

1113
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,520
puppies who had just lost their mom and

1114
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,160
had nowhere to go. So, Secondhand Hound

1115
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,599
said yes and uh we thought maybe we

1116
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,520
could make a love match.

1117
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,920
>> All right. So, you get one dog mama,

1118
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,280
five dog babies. Sort of serendipity.

1119
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,040
You're thinking about maybe a match. So,

1120
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,520
what what happened next, Rachel?

1121
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,240
>> It was crazy. It was like fate. Um we

1122
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,720
introduced them. Mama dog, Rosa, when

1123
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,839
she heard them yipping, she immediately

1124
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,839
started wagging her tail, cleaning them,

1125
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,640
nursing them, and they've been together

1126
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,640
ever since.

1127
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,880
>> Oh my goodness. So, what can we all

1128
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,280
learn from this story, Rachel?

1129
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,440
>> I think it's just great um that Rosa

1130
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,119
adopted these puppies, and I know some

1131
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,079
of your viewers might be looking to

1132
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,599
adopt a dog themselves. And it's just we

1133
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,599
want people to know that you don't need

1134
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,920
to go to a breeder to get a purebred

1135
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,040
like Rosa or to get little puppies like

1136
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,040
these guys. Gosh,

1137
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,520
>> you can go to your local shelter or

1138
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,960
rescue and it saves a life as well.

1139
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,640
>> Liza, thank you for all the wonderful

1140
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,640
work you and others do. Second Hang

1141
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,920
House, fantastic story. Appreciate you

1142
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,760
sharing it. Remember everyone, the power

1143
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,839
of one lies in the power you make a

1144
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,119
difference. One person with one voice.

1145
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,119
Speak the truth. Goodbye everybody.
