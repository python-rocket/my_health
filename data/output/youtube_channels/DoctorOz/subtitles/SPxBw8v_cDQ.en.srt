1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,319
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,240
gas, bloat, constipation. Sometimes it

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,320
seems like no matter what you try, you

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
can never make the stomach pain fully go

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
away. That was the case with Christina.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,480
She recently came on to our show into

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,080
the truth tube and asked for help. Now

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,080
she's back. Let's take a look at how

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,640
she's been doing

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,800
time.

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,960
Remember school teacher Christina? She

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
was constantly constipated.

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
None of the things I've tried have

14
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,080
worked.

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,039
So he called in specialist Dr. Amy

16
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,559
Meyers to help. She's a gut flush that

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,520
everyone can use to take back their

18
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,719
digestive health.

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,480
Definitely excited for this.

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
You will keep a poop journal for us.

21
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,960
Yes. Yes, I will.

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,120
So, how's Christina doing today?

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,000
When I left the show, I started the

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,960
recommended detox by eliminating dairy,

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,719
gluten, soy, corn. I was given a list of

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,920
foods that I was allowed to eat.

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,160
Spinach, um, kale, there was fruits,

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,320
different proteins. At first, nothing

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,719
was happening, but by the end of week

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,199
two, I was hopeful. Today is day one,

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,680
and I went with no trouble. Day two, and

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,840
I went. And for five straight days,

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,240
things were great. I was able to go.

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,600
Yay.

35
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,640
But then everything stopped.

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,360
Unfortunately, today hasn't been my day.

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
I'm not giving up, though. I think part

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,360
of my problem is is that my diet is

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,720
getting repetitive. the foods are not

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,720
changing and it's the same thing over

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,159
and over again. So, I'm looking for

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,400
different foods that I can incorporate

43
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,640
into my diet. I don't want to get backed

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,079
up again. I know I can do this.

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,920
Let's get straight to the truth, too,

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,960
because we have some good news to report

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,159
on Christina. Now, before the show, uh,

48
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,759
and before you started getting a little

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
help from us, you told us you're having

50
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,920
roughly two bowel movements a week,

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,280
right?

52
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,640
Sometimes even less.

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
Yes. Unfortunately.

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,399
Unfortunately, which is never a pleasant

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
feeling to have. No.

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,600
Your bowel movements since the show on

57
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,560
average

58
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,680
four times a week.

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,880
I think it's fabulous. Yeah.

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
How's that feel?

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,719
Very good. Very good. Relieved, happy,

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
excited.

63
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,799
So, it helps with a little bit of this

64
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,720
stuff. So, the good news is you're

65
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
pooping, which I'm very happy about. So,

66
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,000
I think that part of it was the things

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,480
we talked about in the last show, but

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
you might have a problem that a lot of

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
Americans have right now that we don't

70
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
talk about much in Western medicine.

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,879
Okay.

72
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,239
But people who do functional medicine,

73
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,520
look at the root causes for problems.

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,879
Dr. Myers does this.

75
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,160
They have other tests they can do. So

76
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,440
they sent the test off. It's a

77
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
comprehensive stool test.

78
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,760
Mhm.

79
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
And they came back with a absolutely

80
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
fascinating finding.

81
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
Okay.

82
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,040
You have candida and bacterial

83
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,519
overgrowth.

84
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Okay.

85
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,160
In your poop.

86
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
So there are things growing in there

87
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
that aren't supposed to be grown in

88
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,680
there.

89
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
Okay.

90
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
So I want to try to address that today.

91
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
And I also want to address your concern

92
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,200
about the fact that you're eating the

93
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,800
same food all the time and you want some

94
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,319
diversity in diet. If I do those two

95
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,319
things, we'd be smiling and happy.

96
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,879
Yes. Maybe even poop more.

97
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,280
Yes.

98
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
All right. So, uh, I have been

99
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
searching, searching, and I think I have

100
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
the answers. And Dr. Myers is here to

101
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
join us. She's going to walk us through

102
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,879
her gut flush food rules. These can help

103
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,319
anybody, by the way. Anybody who's got

104
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,080
constipation or bloating, all these

105
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,959
things can help you with all of them.

106
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,400
But we're going to help you in

107
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
particular, right? Come on over.

108
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
Even better,

109
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
Dr. Myers, how are you?

110
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,120
Hi. Good. Good to see you.

111
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,760
Ye, you can stay in the middle.

112
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,159
I thought you were going to stay in the

113
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,519
middle.

114
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,400
Were you running away?

115
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
No, definitely not.

116
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
You have to go to the bathroom.

117
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,120
No.

118
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,840
Okay. Just asking. It's possible. All

119
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,840
right. So this this issue of yeast

120
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
overgrowth is a big one. It does cause

121
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
problems for folks. It's something that

122
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
again we don't acknowledge as widely. Uh

123
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,599
but in functional medicine is pretty

124
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
popular.

125
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,720
I see it in virtually almost all of my

126
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,239
patients and a lot of them complaining

127
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,760
of the symptoms that you came in with

128
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,200
with the gas and the bloating and the

129
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,640
constipation.

130
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,959
So the first food rule is to drink an

131
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,159
anti-inflammatory ginger root tea. If

132
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,599
you don't mind explain what this is

133
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,080
everybody, why it works and how we would

134
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,920
make it.

135
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
Yeah. So ginger is very

136
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
anti-inflammatory. Here we're mostly

137
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,720
going to be using some ginger. Boil it

138
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,159
up. Add a little lemon for flavor and

139
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
some mint to top it off.

140
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,599
Interesting.

141
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,959
Give it a taste. See if you like it.

142
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
It's pretty straightforward. It's sort

143
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,239
of what you might expect, but without

144
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,360
the sugar in it. And it's again the

145
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,439
first of several steps we're going to

146
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
give you, but this needs to become so

147
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,319
you'll tolerate that and it's different

148
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
from what you had. Okay. This next step

149
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,360
is important. It's going to address the

150
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,040
issue of variability in what you're

151
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,879
eating, but also help us with the

152
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,120
candida and bacterial overgrowth. That's

153
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,799
to get 50 grams of fiber. But we want

154
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,560
the fiber to come from vegetable

155
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,120
sources, not from grains.

156
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
Okay.

157
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,759
Please explain why that's so important.

158
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,919
So these types of of vegetables which

159
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,240
are your cruciferous vegetables actually

160
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,759
contain sulfur and nitrogen which help

161
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,120
to fight the yeast. Okay?

162
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,320
So that's going to be the most helpful

163
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,919
part. And then we don't want to be

164
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,080
eating the grains particularly gluten

165
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,000
because that easily converts to sugar

166
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,759
which is what candida and the bacterial

167
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
overgrowth are going to be feeding on.

168
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
Okay?

169
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,919
Right. So these are several examples.

170
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,360
And if you're bored by these we have

171
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,680
bigger problems.

172
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,000
These look these are some of my three

173
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,199
favorite recipes that we have. The first

174
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,600
one is a cabbage, spicy cabbage, kale,

175
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,759
and sweet onion salad. And there's a lot

176
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,120
of anti-inflammatory ginger and curcumin

177
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,120
spices and herbs in there as well.

178
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,479
Oh, that's really good.

179
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,440
Is it good?

180
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,360
Surprisingly good.

181
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,120
Yeah, it's amazing. Okay, this is one of

182
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
my favorite. I eat this almost every

183
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
week. This is cherry roasted Brussels

184
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,199
sprouts.

185
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,280
Um, those are actually my new favorite

186
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,199
lately, so I'm excited to

187
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,759
You like Brussels sprouts now? Oh, I

188
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,600
like that.

189
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,639
Yeah, I had some last night for dinner.

190
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,080
They were amazing.

191
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,240
That's uh we have a soup also.

192
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,960
Yeah, we have a broccoli and kale soup

193
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,199
which is super quick. Great on a cold

194
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
day like it is outside right now. And

195
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,759
you know, you can just put it in the

196
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,479
thermos, take it with you to work. It's

197
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,880
delicious.

198
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,160
Okay,

199
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,520
so that's sort of the one big area.

200
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,600
Again, it's more fiber than I normally

201
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,759
recommend. We normally say get 25 to 30.

202
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,440
You're about 25 now. We're asking you

203
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,199
just for you to go up a little higher.

204
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,039
But for everybody, we're saying make

205
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,800
most of that fiber not from grains, but

206
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,720
from vegetables. Okay. Next big issue is

207
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,479
to cook with coconut. This is a big gut

208
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,600
flush rule. Why is that?

209
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,199
So coconut is very antifungal, has

210
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,560
antiviral properties as well, but

211
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,320
there's something in it called caprillic

212
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
acid, which specifically goes in and

213
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,680
pokes holes in the yeast cell wall and

214
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,919
is going to help kill that yeast that

215
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,240
you have. Um, coconut you can use in all

216
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,639
different types of of forms and the oil

217
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,400
and the milk, shredded coconut. So I

218
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,240
love this shrimp. It is cooked in

219
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,919
coconut oil and then also has the

220
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
coconut flakes on top of it. So it's a

221
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,520
coconut shrimp. And this is another one

222
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,240
of my favorites I eat almost every week,

223
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,400
which is chicken pod thai, but we do it

224
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
with spaghetti squash instead of pasta.

225
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,840
And you really cannot even tell the

226
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,960
difference. And it is delicious.

227
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,039
That got the audience excited.

228
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,400
Yeah, it's really good.

229
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,680
And then the last little bit here is a

230
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,039
ritual you and I are going to get into

231
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,240
and anyone else who's having issues with

232
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,440
this. It's a detox shot after dinner. So

233
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,120
here's your shot.

234
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
I want you to drink the shot before Dr.

235
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,560
Myers explains it. So as we're drinking,

236
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,440
please pray to explain it.

237
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,440
Okay. So, we are squeezing uh the juice

238
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,680
of of a of some garlic and then that

239
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,680
good, huh?

240
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,400
Are your eyes watering, too?

241
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,000
I felt it was good.

242
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,319
Okay. Hard for me to explain with those

243
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,720
expressions.

244
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,919
Definitely recommend that one.

245
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,039
Try to blow the air out of my ears.

246
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,240
I was going to say, is it killing off

247
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,080
everything in your body? It's really

248
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,759
good. Cold and flu season's coming up.

249
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
So, this is good for everybody, not just

250
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,080
people suffering from candy. You survive

251
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,599
the shot. The bacteria and viruses

252
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,520
won't.

253
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,440
So, what's in here? You just

254
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,960
I can smell the garlic. So, it's a

255
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,440
garlic. It's about a tablespoon of

256
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,680
garlic. It has uh squeezed a half a

257
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,280
lemon and then a drop of oil of oregano.

258
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,639
Listen, you're well on your way here.

259
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,560
You're going you're going almost every

260
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,919
other day, which means no longer of much

261
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,880
of a concern to me. I want you to be

262
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,560
more regular.

263
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,759
Uh not just going every day, but also

264
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,120
knowing you're going to go every day.

265
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,840
It'll take a big load off your mind and

266
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,319
your intestines.

267
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
Yes.

268
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,039
And I think these will get you there.

269
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,240
Plus, what Dr. Myers walked us through

270
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,520
and walked everyone do today is

271
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,520
something you can do every single day of

272
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
your life and mix it up so darn much,

273
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,599
except for the shot here, which is still

274
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,160
poisoning me.

275
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, I know.

276
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,919
Easy to include. I know. All these

277
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,720

278
