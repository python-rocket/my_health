1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
From the time I was 7 years old, I knew

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,359
I wanted to be a doctor. It was my

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,960
calling to heal and save lives. So, I

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,360
had a hard time understanding how

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,440
someone who was supposed to be a healer

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,000
could be accused of murder. This is

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,160
2-year-old Benjamin. His parents, a

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,119
doctor and a nurse, were charged with

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,279
killing him. Today, in an exclusive

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,840
interview, Benjamin's parents are

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,720
speaking out. Did they have anything to

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,800
do with the death of their son? Crime

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,239
correspondent Melissa Moore is here with

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,320
the story. So Melissa, it gets everybody

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,559
interested. A doctor and a nurse accused

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,920
of murdering their defensees 2-year-old

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
child. What was the community's

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,280
reaction? Well, this became a

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
high-profile case right from the

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,440
beginning. The community was divided in

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,200
taking sides. Some wondered, were they

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
being treated differently because the

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,600
son was adopted from Taiwan? And then

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
also the medical community was divided

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
because of the science of child abuse,

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,960
which is really unclear. I thought it

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,440
was, but I've learned differently. And I

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,360
must say in my mind was the idea that

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,439
this man might be either be given a

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,799
break because he's a doctor, his wife as

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,479
well, cuz she's a nurse. Or maybe it's

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,720
the opposite. They're held to a higher

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,640
standard. Thank you very much, Melissa.

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,360
So, after a three-month investigation,

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,439
Dr. James and Edelyn Yip were charged

36
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,520
with child endangerment. The murder was

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,960
a was the charge in the death of their

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,600
son, Benjamin. But six years later, the

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,400
charges were dropped. The ifs now join

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,320
me. Thank you very much for being here,

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,880
Edeline.

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,640
Dr. Let's start with your son's medical

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,720
condition. Tell us a little bit about

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,119
the problems that you identified as you

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,079
were adopting him. Well, it appeared

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,159
that he had some minor medical problems

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,759
uh when he was in the orphanage. He had

48
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,399
a problem with something called tracho

49
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,000
malaysia which is a bit of a little

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,640
breathing problem. There was a question

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,680
of whether or not one of his kidneys was

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,360
a little misshapen but it didn't appear

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,759
that there were a large number of

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,799
problems or that they were very severe.

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,000
He has a twin Jonathan. Any problems

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:14,959
with Jonathan? Not nearly uh to the

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,040
level of Benjamin. uh he didn't have any

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,440
demonstrated problems of significance in

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,520
the orphanage. So the ifs allowed us to

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,360
look at Benjamin's medical records which

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,120
as you can see from my medical unit

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
carrying these papers is quite

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,879
extensive. That's for a 2-year-old.

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,280
Looking through these records the months

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,480
before Benjamin died, uh he was admitted

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,720
to the hospital for several health

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,319
issues. And I I've jotted these down.

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,160
There was malnourishment. There was

69
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,599
vomiting, dehydration, kidney failure,

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,160
vitamin deficiencies, staff infection,

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,480
several healing fractures in the hands

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,560
and feet. I mean, this is a remarkable

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,080
list of problems. You know, in medicine,

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,599
Dr. You know, since you're a physician,

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,080
you know, but when when you get a chart

76
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,599
that's this thick, you know, there's a

77
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,599
big problem. And that's for a

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,800
2-year-old. How do you explain all of

79
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,519
this?

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,959
Well, um, you know, I I don't think

81
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,200
there is a good explanation, and we

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,400
never got a good explanation from any of

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,720
the physicians that we saw. I

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,599
was investigating non u

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,640
anatomical, non-physiological

86
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,200
potential causes on my own. But, you

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,840
know, we we continue to be in this

88
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,640
process of trying to find an answer.

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,000
So, let's go back to the day that your

90
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
son, Edeline, if you can help me with

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,760
this, to say the day your son was found

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,560
unconscious. What happened? Um, I stayed

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,040
home that day because he wasn't feeling

94
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:47,360
well. Um, he had a feeding tube and um

95
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,560
the feeding tube alarm um went off. So,

96
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,840
I went into his room

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,040
and I found him unresponsive.

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,799
Unresponsive. You're he Yeah. You know

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,439
what that means? Not moving. He reacted.

100
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,560
Yeah.

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,720
He wasn't breathing right.

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,720
So, what did you do? I freaked out.

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Um,

104
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,680
I called 911

105
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,639
and I

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,199
I forgot how to do CPR. I forgot the

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,360
rate of chest compressions to to

108
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:34,400
breaths.

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,440
Um I I turned him on his side

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,840
and he had some food

111
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,560
that came out of his mouth and I freaked

112
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,160
out.

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,360
There there are people watching who are

114
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,280
going to say you're a trained nurse. How

115
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,840
can you forget CPR when you need it

116
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,160
most?

117
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,520
I'm a mom,

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:04,000
first of all, and nothing could ever

119
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:07,120
prepare you in finding your child not

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,039
responsive and not breathing.

121
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,160
So, I couldn't remember.

122
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,520
When the EMS group came,

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,759
you were there with your son.

124
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,280
I gather he was relatively lifeless at

125
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,440
the time. When did you realize that he

126
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,440
had passed?

127
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,639
I didn't know what was happening when

128
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,520
they told us that it was a very terrible

129
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:48,560
thing and it was a grave situation. I

130
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:51,120
was in shock. I could not believe that

131
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,240
that they were thinking that that he was

132
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,240
dying because we did everything we can

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,680
for him.

134
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,639
I I think um you know the thing was is

135
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,800
that he he was on life support for

136
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,400
several days um before he actually um

137
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,240
passed. Can I show everybody what the

138
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,600
medical records have revealed? Sure.

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
So because you allow us to look through

140
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,520
the im the records, we don't have the

141
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,199
actual images, but we have a pretty good

142
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,360
idea of what the doctors were dealing

143
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
with. And I want everyone to understand

144
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
what issues were raised because then

145
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,919
you'll begin to appreciate why their

146
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,120
accusations made and we all have to look

147
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,600
at this and try to decide in our own

148
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,880
minds what we think happened. So in the

149
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,880
chart it says that Benjamin had a

150
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,680
subdural hematoma. That means that he

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,600
had somehow injured part of his head and

152
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
there was bleeding under the surface of

153
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
the skull. You notice it's supposed to

154
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,520
be completely symmetrical and this is

155
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,280
not symmetrical and that caused a shift.

156
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,639
You notice these white lines are not in

157
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
the middle. The white lines are pushed

158
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,479
over and this black circle is supposed

159
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,440
to be some space in your brain. It's

160
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,000
completely missing here. Right? So this

161
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,080
means there was some head trauma that

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
pushed the brain over may have caused a

163
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,919
lot of these injuries. There were also

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,599
bilateral retinal hemorrhages. So in the

165
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,360
back of the eye there was bleeding and

166
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,759
this is together with this this other

167
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,880
findings considered a classic for shaken

168
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,080
baby syndrome. Shaken baby syndrome is

169
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,280
now known as abusive head trauma.

170
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,520
Dr. Yip when you heard these findings

171
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,319
when they were shared with you what were

172
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,000
your first thoughts? Well you know I

173
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,440
went to medical school as well and this

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,199
is the classic triad of uh shaken baby

175
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,880
syndrome. So, um, I knew that we would

176
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,720
be accused.

177
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Adeline, when did you realize that

178
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,759
doctors were thinking that you might be

179
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,639
responsible for your child's injuries

180
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,759
and subsequent death?

181
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,160
When he um

182
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,639
was flown to Sacramento

183
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:02,000
uh at a hospital there and the doctor

184
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,919
told us um about what they were thinking

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,919
about. I was I was horrified.

186
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,240
How could they after all

187
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,240
the things that we've done and after his

188
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
long history

189
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,800
of being ill

190
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,240
think that we would hurt our son?

191
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Just to clear the air, I'm going to ask

192
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:30,080
the question, did you or your husband

193
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,440
ever abuse your son Benjamin? No.

194
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,440
And it's hurtful to hear those

195
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,440
accusations.

196
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,719
I've heard those accusations, but I know

197
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,800
I did not do anything to hurt my son.

198
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,680
Were you angry about the accusations?

199
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,680
Well, yes. I mean, you know, I I think

200
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,640
um I think I know why they happened and

201
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,640
but now I'm more upset knowing about the

202
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,480
science.

203
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,959
Up next, what caused Benjamin's injuries

204
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,040
and why was his brain swelling? The

205
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,640
answers when we come back. Benjamin Yip

206
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,959
was just two years old when his mother,

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,200
a nurse, found him unresponsive in his

208
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,080
room. In a panic, she says she forgot

209
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,839
how to do CPR for reasons still unclear.

210
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,839
Benjamin did not survive. We are back

211
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,600
with Benjamin's parents, Dr. James Yip

212
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,200
and his wife Edeline. Dr. Yip, as you

213
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,240
would take your son, Benjamin, who you

214
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,640
had adopted when how how old was he? He

215
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,600
was 15 months when he came. I'm sorry.

216
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,839
18. 18 months, sorry. When he came home.

217
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,040
So, uh, your adopted son comes into your

218
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,640
home. You're taking him to doctors

219
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,240
because things aren't right. What

220
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,240
diagnosis

221
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,600
that sort of unify the problem are you

222
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,160
hearing? What you must be doing research

223
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,519
on your own as well? Yes, absolutely.

224
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,120
And there was no diagnosis. We had a

225
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,480
number of people look at him from his

226
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,600
primary care doctor to specialists at uh

227
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,399
other institutions. And you know, we

228
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,120
they were focused on specific parts of

229
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,320
his diagnosis, but not really a unifying

230
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:06,320
diagnosis. What do you think was wrong

231
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:10,080
with him? Well, I'm unsure myself why he

232
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,680
was so ill um to start with. So, after

233
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,600
the paramedics rushed Benjamin to the ER

234
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,120
and examined him, doctors believe his

235
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,079
condition was consistent with something

236
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,320
called shaken baby syndrome, which many

237
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,800
of you have heard of. It's called by

238
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,200
physicians abusive head trauma. After a

239
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,160
three-month investigation, Dr. Yip and

240
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:33,040
his wife, nurse Edelyn, were arrested

241
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,880
and charged with murder, child abuse.

242
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,839
Dr. Yip is a doctor. What's it like to

243
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,360
be arrested and charged with the abuse

244
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,440
of your child and the death of your

245
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,320
child?

246
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,959
Well, obviously it perhaps not, but

247
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,079
obviously it it it

248
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,480
speaks to the core of what I am pledged

249
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,000
to do, which is to help people. And it

250
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,560
is against that core value.

251
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,440
And when it occurred, it was something

252
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,399
that made me very upset. Uh, you know, I

253
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,800
was arrested at my place of work um in

254
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,880
front of all of my patients.

255
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,399
Um, why wouldn't you just go turn

256
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,800
yourself in?

257
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,560
We actually agreed to cooperate with the

258
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,800
sheriff's office uh if they chose to do

259
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,200
that, but they chose to show up

260
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,600
unexpectedly and do so and arrest me

261
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,000
there. To make a statement in your

262
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,320
opinion? I I don't know. You know,

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,720
obviously they never actually made

264
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,680
specific accusations about who did what.

265
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,920
It's my belief that I was arrested in an

266
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:43,360
attempt to use the arrest as leverage to

267
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:46,800
either um turn against my wife or uh

268
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,160
somehow because of loss of income uh be

269
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,079
willing to make a deal.

270
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,560
Adeline, the theory is that you were the

271
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,279
last person with your son. You delivered

272
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,760
a fatal blow to his head. It led to that

273
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,600
bleeding and the swelling and the other

274
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,680
challenges and problems that we talked

275
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,920
about when I was showing those images.

276
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,600
How do you respond as a mother to that

277
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,519
accusation? I didn't do it. I took care

278
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,120
of my son

279
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,800
every day and

280
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,880
I didn't I did not hit him.

281
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,360
So after the arrest, authorities took

282
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,800
away your two other children. Yeah. It's

283
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,920
a compounding an accusation

284
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,200
actually before the arrest. Yeah. It

285
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,600
took the children away from you

286
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,519
beforehand. Yes. They took I'm sorry. Go

287
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,040
ahead. They took the children away the

288
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:44,399
day after Benjamin went to the hospital.

289
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,800
So he was in the hospital dying and

290
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,240
child protective services ripped our

291
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,160
children away from our friends. How do

292
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,480
you deal with that? grieving for the

293
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,200
loss of one son while seeing your other

294
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:02,920
two children taken from you. You can't

295
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,920
you can't grieve. We have not had

296
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,320
a time to fully grieve.

297
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,959
How long were they taking from you for?

298
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,360
They were gone almost a year. A year?

299
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,360
Yes. Yes.

300
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,560
Let me just touch on one other issue

301
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,560
because I'm still stunned by this.

302
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,320
You're both working folks like so many

303
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,320
couples in America. Yes. There were

304
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,519
other caregivers involved with your

305
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,519
three children, all adopted.

306
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,880
Is there a possibility that someone who

307
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,200
cared for Benjamin may have been

308
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,120
involved in these injuries? No. No, we

309
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,880
we don't believe so. We don't think so.

310
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,200
I was the one who was a primary

311
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,680
caregiver. So, if anything happened, you

312
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,000
would have known about it. Yes. Up next,

313
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,399
a surprising twist in the case. Shaken

314
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,800
baby syndrome may not have caused

315
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,120
Benjamin's death. So, what did and who

316
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,519
was to blame? We're back with a doctor

317
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,920
and nurse who were accused of murdering

318
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,399
their son. Benjamin was just 2 years old

319
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,800
when he died after arriving unresponsive

320
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,600
to the ER. Doctors found his condition

321
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,279
consistent with shaken baby syndrome.

322
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,680
Benjamin's parents, Dr. James Yip and

323
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,440
his wife Edund are back with us. From

324
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,399
the beginning, both of you vehemently

325
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,160
denied the charges, the accusations that

326
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,839
you were responsible for shaken baby

327
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,839
syndrome. So, if that's not why Benjamin

328
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:28,639
died, why do you think he died?

329
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,160
I think he um he aspirated, he swallowed

330
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,160
um

331
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,000
some of the the food that he ate that

332
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,680
evening, it got dislodged into his

333
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,160
lungs. that because when I remember when

334
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,959
I turned him over, there were pieces of

335
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,560
carrots and potatoes that were coming

336
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,360
out of his mouth.

337
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,440
So, I think he aspirated.

338
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
So, after more than six years of

339
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,040
fighting to prove their innocence,

340
00:14:52,959 --> 00:15:01,040
prosecutors dropped the charges.

341
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,839
Big move. How does it feel to be out

342
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:09,600
from under those allegations?

343
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:12,079
It's freeing, but you know, there's

344
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,560
there's some not being able to believe

345
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,320
it's finally over.

346
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,079
Can I bring in an an expert in this area

347
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,880
because I want to get to this issue of

348
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,040
shaken baby syndrome. What is it really?

349
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,120
An attorney involved, Paige Kab from the

350
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,240
Innocence Project is joining us now.

351
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,240
Paige, thank you very much for being

352
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
with us. Thank you for having me, Dr. H.

353
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,120
I'm stunned here. I'm I'm I'm looking at

354
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,880
a couple of medical professionals who

355
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
are accused of murdering their child for

356
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,480
reasons that I completely understand. At

357
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,240
least I thought I did. You know, head

358
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,519
injuries, bleeding in the eye, things

359
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,800
that are consistent with this shaking

360
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,720
baby syndrome, which I thought I

361
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,279
understood. Why did the prosecutors drop

362
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,440
the charges? So, this is really a case

363
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,199
of guilty until proven innocent. And and

364
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,440
part of what happens in these cases is

365
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,120
when we when doctors see these injuries,

366
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,639
these findings, um there is this there's

367
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,639
they've been trained that this is shaken

368
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,880
baby syndrome or abusive head trauma.

369
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,320
And so they tell the the prosecutors

370
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,639
that and they of course believe the

371
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,720
experts. So we really had to prove that

372
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,279
the yips were innocent, that Benjamin

373
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,040
had had this lifelong serious illness,

374
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,759
that he was unable to shake these

375
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,759
infections. And that ultimately led to

376
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,680
the stroke which is one of the things we

377
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,519
had to show them was that strokes can

378
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,000
cause subdural hematomas which I know is

379
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,680
one of your questions. So this all

380
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,360
started with a British neurosurgeon who

381
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,079
was looking at a baby had a subdural

382
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,839
hematoma. Um and he was wondering how

383
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,680
does this baby have this internal trauma

384
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,560
and no external signs of trauma? No

385
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,320
bruises, no skull fracture, no swelling.

386
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,160
Um and he came up with shaking this idea

387
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,839
that maybe you shake a baby and that's

388
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
how you get this internal injury with no

389
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,600
external injury. And so he wrote a paper

390
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,199
to warn people about the dangers. It's

391
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,120
like taking an egg and shaking it really

392
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
hard, right? You'll scramble the egg on

393
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,639
the inside, but the shell will still be

394
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,639
intact. That's the basic concept.

395
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,880
Exactly. And that turned into this rash

396
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,959
of diagnosis. There are thousands of

397
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,480
potentially innocent people in prison or

398
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,800
who've had their families ripped apart

399
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,720
because of this diagnosis. And it got so

400
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,720
bad that that British neurosurgeon who

401
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,720
first came up with it came out in 2012

402
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,439
and said, "This is just a hypothesis."

403
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,120
And it's still an unproven hypothesis.

404
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,199
Emily, Emily, you're the the face of

405
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,280
this now. H how are you recovering?

406
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,000
Not knowing what the new normal is quite

407
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,679
yet. Um

408
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,760
it's it's been very difficult. Um

409
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,000
because now a lot of people know about

410
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,400
it and our children have questions and

411
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,080
it's it's

412
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,240
we've come to realize that we're not

413
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,720
alone in this battle. We were very

414
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:46,080
fortunate to have our community um stand

415
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,240
behind us and our faith. Um we were told

416
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,760
that if we wanted our kids back, we had

417
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,000
to get a divorce and we said no, we did

418
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,880
not do anything. We want our children

419
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,240
back. Um we stood firm on our belief and

420
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,960
knowing that we're innocent and we we

421
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,480
fought and to to get to where we are

422
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
today.

423
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,559
I would have thought you just put this

424
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,840
behind you, but you've agreed to come on

425
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:19,440
the show and tell your story. Yes. Why?

426
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:24,160
Well, I think um we want to encourage

427
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,480
people who may be accused to actually

428
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,640
to be honest with themselves and don't

429
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,880
let somebody convince you that you've

430
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,039
done something wrong. This is not

431
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,400
medical certainty, no matter what they

432
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:41,280
are told. And it seems that our

433
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:44,640
our attitude now is to believe an

434
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,240
accusation immediately as it is made.

435
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,880
And I hope that the public will

436
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,440
return to the true belief in innocence

437
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,880
until proven guilty.

438
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,440
I wish you the best with your two

439
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,960
children. Thank you. Thank you for
