1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:08,160
He's known by three letters,

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:10,240
BTK. Bind, torture, kill. The notorious

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,480
serial killer terrorized America's

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,679
heartland and murdered 10 innocent

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,080
people. Dennis Rder was living a double

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,840
life as a soft-spoken family man and

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,160
church leader. And he's been writing to

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,760
me from prison. Lots of insights here.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,480
We have these letters today. What do

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,480
they reveal about his psyche? and his

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,800
daughter Carrie is here finally opening

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,640
up years after learning the truth about

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,719
the man she thought was a loving

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,040
father. For over 30 years, the area

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,399
surrounding Witchah, Kansas, lived under

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,000
the dark spectre of a serial

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,800
killer. One who taunted authorities with

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,760
poems, depictions, and clues boasting of

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,680
his twisted murders bearing his sadistic

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,239
signature, "Be

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,920
tind, torture, kill." His reign of

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,239
terror began January 15th,

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,479
1974. The day 15-year-old Charlie Otero

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,960
returned home from school. Moments after

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,000
his brother Danny, 14, and sister

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Carmen, 13, to discover unspeakable

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,720
horror. Alerted by Carmen's screams,

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,080
Charlie would find his parents,

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,560
38-year-old Joseph and 34year-old Julie,

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,720
bound with rope, suffocated, and

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,560
strangled to death in their bedroom.

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,799
Charlie tried frantically to revive

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,799
them. Finding the house phone dead,

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,960
Danny ran to a neighbor for help.

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
Responding officers would find the three

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,600
eldest Otto children sobbing on the

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,520
front lawn of their home. Inside, they

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,840
would later find their little brother,

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,079
9-year-old Joseph Jr., bound and

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,320
affixiated in his bedroom. Their

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,799
11-year-old sister, Josie, would be

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,759
found hanging from a pipe, bound and

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,159
partially clothed in the basement. Their

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,079
brutal, senseless, and sickening murders

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,240
would send shock waves through the quiet

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,640
Midwestern community. They would be the

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,719
first in a series of 10 unsolved murders

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
that would torment the area and

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,439
authorities for more than three decades

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,560
as the killer played a twisted cat and

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,000
mouse game with the media and law

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,840
enforcement before finally falling prey

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,160
to his depraved desire to be

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,400
acknowledged for his murders when a

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,160
floppy disc would link the killer to his

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,239
crimes in

57
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,120
2005. The suspect would be shocking.

58
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,680
Dennis Rider, an Air Force veteran and

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,000
family man known for his role as a

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,160
church and cub scout leader. The

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,120
accusation would blindside his wife of

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,000
34 years, their grown son, and their

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,840
daughter, Carrie. In court, Raider's

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,680
gruesome recounting of his killings

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,120
would further devastate the families of

66
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,360
his victims and his own. Today, Raider

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,760
is serving consecutive life sentences in

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,760
prison. But the daughter he raised

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,920
continues to struggle with the reality

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,560
that the father she thought she knew,

71
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,000
she now knows as a serial

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,319
killer. Dennis Rder's daughter, Carrie

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,920
Rosson, joins me now. I know this is

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,360
difficult to go through and I appreciate

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,720
you coming on here and talking honestly

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,040
about your dad and your relationship

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,560
with him. What kinds of thoughts keep

78
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,000
you up at night when you think about

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Dennis Rder? um since the arrest of 14

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,920
years ago. I mean, the initial just

81
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,080
running it through my head trying to

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,840
figure out was this true and could he

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,360
have really committed these crimes, you

84
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,120
know, and who was the man that raised

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,280
me? Um like now I still have night

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,319
terrors. What happens during your night

87
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,319
tears? Um, so I it's usually I fall

88
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,680
asleep too quick, you know, or I'm very

89
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,000
tired and then within like 30 minutes to

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,360
an hour I'll wake up screaming like

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,519
screaming full on waking up the house.

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,480
Um, I always think there's somebody in

93
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,560
my room there in my bedroom there to

94
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,959
hurt me and I'm it's like I'm trying to

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,239
fight them off. Let's unwrap this a

96
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,319
little bit. By the way, night terrors

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,640
are pretty common for kids to have,

98
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,560
right? Probably 40% of kids have them.

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,879
They said your autopilot just goes

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
crazy. It's it's it's wired to relax the

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,200
lamp, but yours doesn't. Therapy

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
actually does work often times for it,

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,159
but ultimately you got to deal with the

104
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,680
demons, right? Some of the ones that may

105
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,159
be left behind from the interactions

106
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,560
with your dad. How would you describe

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,720
what kind of a person he was? He's been

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,639
labeled labeled a serial killer, right?

109
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,080
But that's not how you probably saw him.

110
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,560
No. No. Um he was a pretty much good dad

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,720
most of the time. Like we camped and we

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,160
fished. He was basically my best friend,

113
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
my buddy. We would walk the dog

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,560
together. That was just something I did

115
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,960
with him. Garden. We built tree houses.

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
We would run to the hardware store. He

117
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,000
and he didn't just do things with you.

118
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,440
He taught you. So, he taught me about

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,440
the outdoors. He taught me how to plant

120
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,400
a garden. He taught me how to fish. And

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,800
I was very, very close to him all up

122
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,680
until the day of his arrest. But there

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,240
was also that other side of like

124
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,560
occasional anger in our houses, flashes

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,800
of eruption, you know, like you were

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,520
scared sometimes of who was home and

127
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,600
what he would do. He was like could

128
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,960
undercut you with abuse, emotional

129
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,120
abuse, too. Did he ever physically hit

130
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,080
anything that you ever saw you, a pet?

131
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,000
He did not ever hit me. Um, but my mom

132
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,240
had made this wonderful like dinner of

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,759
manakotti and we got into this fight on

134
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,160
the table and my dad like leaped out of

135
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,639
his chair and grabbed my brother and put

136
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,800
his hands around my brother's neck like

137
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,680
from the front and started to try to

138
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,240
strangle my brother at dinner. And when

139
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,840
my dad did that, it was like like it

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,520
wasn't my dad for a second. His face

141
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,680
changed. It was like full of rage and

142
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,400
cold and his eyes would narrow. And then

143
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,840
when he we pushed him off, he his

144
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,840
shoulders slumped and you could tell he

145
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,520
felt sorry and realized what he had

146
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,199
done, you know. But honestly, like that

147
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,880
that happened one more time a few years

148
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
later, but I don't ever remember talking

149
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,720
about it with my family after that. Ju

150
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,479
just to put it on in context, your

151
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,560
father had actually murdered people

152
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,320
before you were even born, right? He

153
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,720
committed seven murders, including a

154
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,000
family of four, leaving orphaning three

155
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,840
older kids for the Oo family. And then

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,400
after the Otteros, he murdered Katherine

157
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,280
Bright who was young over by the um WSU

158
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,520
campus, the college campus in ' 74. Then

159
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,759
he stopped. Then my brother was born.

160
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,600
Then in 77, he married Shirley. He

161
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,120
murdered Shirley Vianne Ralford. She was

162
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,319
a mom and he murdered her in front of

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,800
her children. He locked him in a

164
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,039
bathroom. Then in 77 when my mom was

165
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,840
pregnant, um she was three months

166
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,479
pregnant with me. He murdered Nancy Fox.

167
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,400
And I found out in therapy in 15 that

168
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,840
when he murdered Nancy Fox, he took his

169
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,639
belt off and strangled her with his

170
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,520
belt. When I and then I I in therapy

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,639
then working through like she took me

172
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,720
back to that and I remembered when I was

173
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,400
four, dad had taken his belt off and

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,759
threatened me and I could still see him

175
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,639
loomed in the hallway with a light

176
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,039
behind him snapping that belt at me and

177
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,120
I had completely suppressed that. And

178
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,520
then I and then when I realized what he

179
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
had done to Nancy, like the therapist

180
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,759
said that was a major breakthrough to

181
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,080
like pull that back out and have that in

182
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,759
the open and put it in place. There are

183
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,160
these isolated moments. Many of them

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,000
you've obscured, you've blinded yourself

185
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
to. A lot of us do that in our lives. We

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,680
forget the the harmful things we've

187
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,840
experienced. So if you didn't know that

188
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,199
your father was a serial murderer, what

189
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,759
would you say you love the most about

190
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,000
him?

191
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:33,759
um just that he would spend time with

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,120
you and he was kind and like like he

193
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,120
loved you and like he would go to any

194
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,520
any effort to take care of you. So when

195
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,280
I was in college I was 2 hours away and

196
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
I didn't have a car so he was the guy

197
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,440
that would drive after work on Fridays

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,360
and come get me. The man everybody knows

199
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,440
after '05 doesn't match my father at

200
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,360
all. you know, like when he was

201
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,759
arrested, I tried to alibi him and say

202
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,520
like you got the wrong guy. Like, you

203
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,599
know, he's a church leader, boy scout

204
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,720
leader, a really good dad, except, you

205
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,479
know, for a few incidents, you know, and

206
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,680
nobody would believe me. And my mom said

207
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
the same thing, like she was sitting

208
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,879
there with the police on the day of his

209
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,879
arrest saying, "You've got the wrong

210
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,680
man." You know, my all my family told

211
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,639
him that, too. But, you know, and then

212
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,319
you come to find out

213
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:21,560
like you never knew that person, you

214
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,479
know, but nowadays I try to tell people

215
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,120
like the only man I know is my dad and

216
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,639
that's why I still love my dad because I

217
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,599
have to hold on to that or I'm going to

218
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,360
die or I would be dead, you know? And so

219
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,680
I don't know BTK. It's

220
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,760
taken 10 years in and out of therapy to

221
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,440
even be able to say BTK or look you in

222
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,959
the eyes and say that and sit here and

223
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,600
talk to you. That's why I've never done

224
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,080
media before because I wouldn't have

225
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,160
been able to handle it. So people think

226
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm crazy that I still love my dad, but

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,760
I don't know anybody else. That's the

228
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,120
only person I know. You know, I think I

229
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,959
think you're very brave for telling your

230
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,360
truth and don't let anyone take that

231
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,920
away from you. It's not your fault your

232
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,279
dad did what he

233
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,360
did. And when we come back, the moment

234
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,360
6-year-old Carrie realized a murder in

235
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,040
her town would change her life forever.

236
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,720
We'll be right back. We're back with

237
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,519
serial killer BTK's daughter, Carrie

238
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:18,000
Rosson. So, when he was terrorizing that

239
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,880
Kansas town? Mhm.

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,800
You were there, right? Were you fearful

241
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
as you heard about these crimes, not

242
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,399
knowing it was your own father in your

243
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,880
own house? Well, in so in ' 85 I was 6

244
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,240
years old and our neighbor U Marine

245
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,560
Hedge, she went missing and um 10 days

246
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,360
later they found her body strangled out

247
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,320
in the country um a few miles east of

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,399
our church. Somehow at 6 years old I

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,080
knew she had been abducted and I knew

250
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,160
she had been murdered and strangled and

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,760
a six-year-old shouldn't know that. Did

252
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,920
your father know you were scared about?

253
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,800
did. And I didn't know he knew I was

254
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,519
scared until I read it in Ramslland's

255
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,360
book and he said it worried him that

256
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,480
like the murder of Mrs. Hedge was

257
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,440
affecting me even though he had done he

258
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,360
had done the murder but he also got off

259
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,440
on it.

260
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,200
Got off like narcissist like sexual

261
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,839
sadistic high. That's what he is. This

262
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,440
is a sexual sadistic psychopath. So,

263
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,760
he's basically getting a power trip

264
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,519
because his daughter's now got trauma in

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,440
her house. So, I'm six. I knew dad was

266
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,680
gone that night because I knew he was at

267
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,200
a scout camp out and I had slept with my

268
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,560
mom because I was scared cuz we had a

269
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,440
thunderstorm. I knew that at

270
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,519
6. Then when the police come in 2005 to

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,800
my house, the FBI, they're telling me

272
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,240
and I'm like, "No, no, you've got the

273
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,440
wrong eye." And I said, "What are the

274
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,200
dates?" Then my then I remember Mrs.

275
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,600
Hedge. my guts just sear in half. And

276
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,000
that was like that first moment that oh

277
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,079
my god, I think my dad murdered Mrs.

278
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,839
Hedge. And and then it came to find out

279
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,200
like a few hours later my dad confessed

280
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,560
to Mrs. Hedge.

281
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,720
When your when you learned that your

282
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,880
father had

283
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,800
confessed, how'd that affect you? You

284
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,440
know, I'm so out of it. I'm so I'm

285
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,440
physical shock for 5 days. I'm shaking.

286
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,320
Come to find out, my dad had taken

287
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,079
jewelry and driver's license from his

288
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,519
victims, and he had hid them in a false

289
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,959
bottom space underneath our um catchall

290
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,040
in the hallway where we rode out

291
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,399
tornadoes. So, I mean, our three

292
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,240
bedrooms were there in the bathroom was

293
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,720
a small three-bedroom ranch. So, you're

294
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,600
walking past where this evidence is for

295
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
26 years of your

296
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,279
life. And like, I think the FBI knew to

297
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,560
tell us that so we would know it was

298
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:45,600
real. So my family knew quite a bit more

299
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,560
before the public did. So we knew we

300
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,800
knew very early on my dad was guilty.

301
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,399
And so then we spent months riding my

302
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,160
dad trying to convince him to plead

303
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
guilty. You know, I'm like, you know,

304
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,079
you're guilty. Tell them you're guilty.

305
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,880
Like save the victim's family, save the

306
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,959
community, save our family from like

307
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,480
millions of dollars and two years of

308
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,720
trial, which you see what Golden State's

309
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,040
going through right now. Yeah, like like

310
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
just take the plea.

311
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,920
Up next, the day Carrie will never

312
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,519
forget. She's taken us back to the

313
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,760
moment she realized her father was a

314
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,240
serial killer terrorizing their town and

315
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,959
how her DNA helped put him behind bars.

316
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,120
Don't go away. For decades, the BTK

317
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,200
killer had toyed with the Witchah,

318
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,680
Kansas police task force trying to catch

319
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,560
him, sending them taunting letters,

320
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,560
twisted clues, and even asking advice as

321
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,279
to whether a floppy disc could be traced

322
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,959
to a particular computer. Raider

323
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,320
believed the lieutenant who claimed it

324
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,160
couldn't, it could. And when BTK sent a

325
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,399
floppy disc to a local television

326
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,600
station, it was quickly linked to a

327
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,920
computer at Dennis Raiders's church. But

328
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,399
DNA testing would link him to his

329
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,480
killings. Prosecutors subpoenaed a

330
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,639
tissue sample from a papsmear done on

331
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,120
Raider's daughter, Carrie, at a student

332
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,920
clinic near Kansas State University,

333
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,959
which he had attended 5 years earlier.

334
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,600
DNA tests on that sample matched DNA

335
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,480
collected at BTK's first murders more

336
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,880
than 30 years ago. It showed beyond

337
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,800
doubt that Carrie Raider was related to

338
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,680
BTK, that the man responsible for the

339
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,000
brutal murders of at least 10 people was

340
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,000
her

341
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,000
father. We're back with serial killer

342
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,480
BTK's daughter, Carrie Rosson. So, it

343
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,480
was your DNA that helped put your father

344
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,399
behind bars.

345
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,680
Were you aware that your DNA was being

346
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,320
used? No. Um, when the FBI agent knocked

347
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,880
on my door on February 25th,05, I was

348
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,480
still even in my pajamas and the FBI

349
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,320
agent is dropping like the bombshell of

350
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,160
bombshells on me in my kitchen, telling

351
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,399
me he's like, "Your dad is BTK." Like,

352
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,160
he just dropped it like that.

353
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,920
So, we talked for about an hour and then

354
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,160
we got up to leave and the agent says,

355
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,519
"Well, we need your DNA to match it to

356
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,920
some things." And I was like, "What

357
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,519
things?" And he's like, "Evidence." And

358
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,440
he and he didn't know how to collect

359
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,199
DNA. And I said, "You know what? Well,

360
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,800
on CSI, like they grab swabs and swab I

361
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,199
literally said that like swab your

362
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,120
mouth." So, we grabbed Q-tips and swab

363
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,680
my mouth. And I was like the one that

364
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,360
told him how to do it.

365
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,680
This is so bizarre. Now they they had

366
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,560
actually they had already taken my DNA.

367
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,360
So then I think just so they they got

368
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,040
they you had a papsmear, right? They had

369
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,160
actually subpoenaed the papsmear which I

370
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,639
didn't know they could do but without

371
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,399
your knowledge and they got the DNA from

372
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,920
that and that's how they figured this

373
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,760
out. The swab I guess was to confirm

374
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,920
that. I think it was also to kind of

375
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,600
cover their rares like like just in case

376
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,120
in case it wasn't be allowed to be used

377
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,519
in court. Exactly. And so then that was

378
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,440
Friday and on Saturday night CNN ran an

379
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,160
article that was that said I had turned

380
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,000
in my father and I had given blood and I

381
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,000
knew those two things were wrong. I was

382
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
very angry and I felt betrayed because

383
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,920
my father had betrayed me. These

384
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,160
institutions that I loved and adored. My

385
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,600
father had betrayed me. Now a few weeks

386
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,600
the media was betraying me. An

387
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
institution that I loved journalism. I

388
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,680
love journalism. Now they're stalking

389
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,360
me. So I'm I'm betrayed by the media.

390
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,199
So, I wanted to make sure people

391
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,480
understood at that time that's how I

392
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,720
felt. And it took 10 years before I was

393
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,199
able to talk to a journalist and not be

394
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,560
angry.

395
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,480
I'm glad you're not angry today and

396
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,560
talking to me about stuff that matters a

397
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,519
lot. Right. When was the last time you

398
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,160
saw your father? 2004 in December. We

399
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,680
were home for Christmas. And so, dad

400
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,199
came out of the bathroom. He was in his

401
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,600
brown compliance uniform. He looks like

402
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,519
a county sheriff. He's all got his his

403
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,440
belt his belt on and his gear and his

404
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,639
nightstick. He's like way overdone for

405
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,800
his compliance job. And I hugged him. He

406
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,399
smelled like Old

407
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,320
Spice. He hugged me really tight. He

408
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,000
said, "Um, I love you." Which he hardly

409
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,199
ever said, rarely ever was affectionate

410
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,320
verbally. He said, "I love you and I'll

411
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,920
see you soon." Because they were going

412
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,399
to come up and see us again. And I said,

413
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,480
"I love you and I'll see you soon." And

414
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,480
that was it. He's gone. And

415
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:14,399
so in ' 05 when I knew I was never going

416
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,160
to see him again, even though I I was

417
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,480
falling apart, I knew to seal that

418
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,639
memory tight. I knew to go back and try

419
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,040
to remember like how he smelled, how he

420
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,959
felt. And I can like still feel him

421
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,880
today because I'm never going to have

422
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,880
that again. And people people are

423
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,480
knocking me still like they're saying,

424
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,800
"You don't have the right to talk about

425
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,560
him. You don't have the right to suffer.

426
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,240
you didn't lose anything. He's a

427
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,079
monster. You don't have the right to

428
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,720
talk. You don't have the right to write.

429
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,639
You don't have the right to

430
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:49,279
grief. And I would never say that to

431
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:51,839
anybody about anything. You know, it's I

432
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,240
lost the man that I loved. I lost this

433
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,199
massively important person in my life

434
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,880
and he was taken

435
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:00,160
away. And I was never allowed to grieve

436
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,320
because you can't how do you have a

437
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,079
funeral for someone that's still alive?

438
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,799
And how do you grieve publicly for

439
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,640
somebody that everybody

440
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:10,720
hates, you know? So, what do you do? You

441
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,240
just you gather up with the people, you

442
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,400
know, your family, and you try to hold

443
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,720
on and

444
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,959
survive

445
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,760
because I mean, you're not you're not

446
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,199
allowed to do it publicly, you know, and

447
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,839
people are like, "You shouldn't have

448
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,839
wrote about that good decent man." And I

449
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,400
said, "I had to write about the good

450
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,799
decent man. I had to find him again. I

451
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,799
spent years going back in those memories

452
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,200
to find him again because I needed to

453
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,799
find my dad before I could write about

454
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,720
BTK.

455
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,960
Writing books is often therapeutic. It's

456
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,240
cathartic. If you're okay with this, I'd

457
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,640
like you to read an excerpt from

458
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,320
something you wrote. Dear Carrie, I'm

459
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,799
starting to enter a phase in life that

460
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,280
mom may not accept me, and her loyalty

461
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,280
is beginning to weaken. I sent her a

462
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,919
birthday card, Mother's Day card, and no

463
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,520
letter or thanks. Her last letter was a

464
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,000
month ago. Do you think I should still

465
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,000
write? It hurts to write and not get any

466
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
reflection.

467
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:14,679
You write you you say that those letters

468
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,679
anger you. But what angers you the most?

469
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,520
I mean, the letters anger me because you

470
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,760
see the narcissism and I'd never saw it

471
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
before. You see, it's about him and why

472
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,240
aren't people calling me? Why aren't

473
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,640
people visiting me? why aren't you, you

474
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,080
know, supporting me in my time of need

475
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,400
in the prison, which, you know, I'm

476
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,160
sitting here trying not to roll my eyes.

477
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,880
Um, what really angers me

478
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,320
are like that public perception that my

479
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,120
family was culpable and that we were

480
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,120
hiding something. And we've always said

481
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,840
that if we had any inkling he had harmed

482
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,200
someone, let alone murdered anyone, you

483
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,240
know, we would have gone screaming out

484
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,160
that door to the police. You don't sit

485
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
down with a man and serve him manakotti

486
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,320
if you think he's murdered like even

487
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,320
harm someone

488
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,400
you know and at the very most when I

489
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,799
shared about him hurting my brother like

490
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,240
we thought that was the whole iceberg we

491
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,840
didn't realize it was the very tip and

492
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,559
that there was psych psychosis

493
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,400
underneath it

494
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:17,679
right the other thing that angers me is

495
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,960
that my dad now tries to throw like his

496
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,679
mother my grandma Dorothia under the bus

497
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,120
like blames her for something wrong with

498
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,039
my dad. My grandma Dorothia and his dad,

499
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,960
my grandpa Bill were the most amazing

500
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,520
people. It's very brave of you to talk

501
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,120
about this. Probably painful as well.

502
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,960
What is your hope? What is your goal

503
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,559
coming public for the first time the way

504
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:45,200
you are? I want one I realized when

505
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:47,600
I for 10 years I prayed to God and I

506
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,120
said I want a quiet peaceful life. I

507
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,320
want the media to go away. I want to be

508
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,760
left alone. And God granted that. The

509
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,160
problem is all of that suffering, pain,

510
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,840
everything I'm telling you about times a

511
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,320
thousand embedded in me and it was

512
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,080
rotting inside

513
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,000
me. So it wasn't until after I forgave

514
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,160
my dad, I came back to started to come

515
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,360
back to myself in 2012 and I forgave him

516
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,520
for what he had done to me. The

517
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,880
betrayal, not for the crimes, those are

518
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,320
not mine. Those are the families to

519
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,720
forgive. I forgave him for what he did

520
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,600
to my

521
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,000
family writing. That's how I heal. So I

522
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,919
went and did it to heal. And then

523
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,520
everybody, a lot of people reached out

524
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,559
as soon as I started talking and saying,

525
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,480
"You're helping us like abuse victims,

526
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,880
crime victims, people with criminals in

527
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,320
their family, war veterans with PTSD."

528
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,000
They were privately reaching out and

529
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,159
saying, "Something in your story is

530
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,559
positively helping us with our own

531
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,799
trauma. And after this book, this book

532
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,280
came out a week ago, I am flooded with

533
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,760
messages of people saying you're helping

534
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,400
us heal." Well, I think you did that

535
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,039
today. I thank you for coming on and

536
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,720
