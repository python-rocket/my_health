Hello. How are you? Welcome to the show.

Thank you. So, how much can we believe

from all the glossies, the magazine

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,680
pictures we see of these folks? Well,

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,359
the magazine's job is to know any and

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,600
everything about the celebs, so trust

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,439
them. Plus, I did my own research. Dr.

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,280
Oz, I talked to some doctors, some

30
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,360
stylists, as well as all my experience

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
on the red carpet. These celebrities

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,479
know what they're talking about, and I'm

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,520
listening. All right, let's go to it.

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,280
Over here, we're going to start with

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,680
famous faces. The first famous face is

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Lupita Nongo. The queen Lupita. Well,

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,880
let me tell you, her skin is

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,320
effervescent. She illuminates from the

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,600
inside out. So, we're going to listen to

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,560
what she does. She's all about avocado

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,520
oil. Yes. What she does is she uses it

42
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,520
as a moisturizer all over her face and

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,799
she just really gets all shiny and glowy

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,079
and delicious. Well, she looks

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,759
beautiful. She does. How do you How do

46
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,439
you apply it? Well, it's easy. You want

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,360
to wash your skin with a regular facial

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,200
wash and then you slather it on your

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,520
skin like moisturizer. It's much like

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
lotion except for way better and

51
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,799
natural. You know, Leita likes to be

52
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
organic. But most importantly, it's thin

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,880
enough that it will penetrate the skin,

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,479
but it's thick enough that it acts as a

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,159
protective barrier and that's why it

56
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,920
works. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Next

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
famous face we'll talk about and but but

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,439
I should point this out. Avocado oil has

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,399
restorative processes if it's cold

60
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,479
pressed which is what you want to look

61
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,840
for. So you approve? I approve. Okay,

62
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,280
great. Jennifer Anderson's been on the

63
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,640
show. What is her health secret to keep

64
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
that skin of hers looking so darn

65
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,879
smooth? Yeah, she's amazing. She's 46

66
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,239
years old. She looks half her age. So

67
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,200
again, you want to listen to what she

68
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,680
has to say. And her secret is petroleum

69
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,280
oil. Super cheap, super easy. You can

70
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
get it anywhere, even a gas station.

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Petroleum jelly. Where does she put it?

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,599
Petroleum jelly. She puts it right under

73
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,480
her eyes so that she can moisturize her

74
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,440
under under eyes and wart away wrinkles,

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,120
which is what every girl wants, right?

76
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,280
Yes. And then on top of that, for a

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,800
twofer, she fills her sink up the next

78
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
morning. She wears it all night long.

79
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,120
She fills up her sink with ice and cold

80
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,440
water, sticks her face in it so she can

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,800
reduce the puffiness of her eyes. That

82
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,239
makes a lot of sense cuz then if you do

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,519
that, the blood vessels, they narrow

84
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,200
down a little bit. So it stops any

85
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,280
swelling you might get. So no wrinkles

86
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,959
and she's It's so easy to do. petroleum

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
gel. I'll do I have big bags. I'll start

88
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,800
doing that. All right. You look great.

89
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,280
One more famous face. Lisa Rena. What's

90
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,120
her secret? Our favorite new housewife

91
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,720
in Beverly Hills. Now, Lisa Ra is known

92
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
for a couple things. She's gorgeous. Her

93
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,000
body and her pucker, right? Big lips.

94
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,040
Big old juicy lips. Well, what she does

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,040
is she adds cinnamon to her beauty

96
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,920
regime so that she can keep them nice

97
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,599
and plump and kissable. Cinnamon. You're

98
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,680
kidding me. How does it work? Well, what

99
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,360
she does is she puts her lip gloss on or

100
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,959
lipstick and she just takes a pinch,

101
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,440
just a little bit. It goes a long way.

102
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,599
And she dabs it all over her lips,

103
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,200
mushes it in, waits a couple minutes,

104
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,799
and boom, pow, kissable lips. Cinnamon

105
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,000
must be the most useful thing out. I'm

106
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,360
serious. You use it for everything. One

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
little cautionary thing cuz I play with

108
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
this a little bit. Don't put it on dry

109
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
cuz it can irritate your skin. So, make

110
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
sure, as you say, put it on your, you

111
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,879
know, something with some Yeah. Make

112
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,480
sure there's a barrier. Put your gloss

113
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,720
and it's a twofer. It tastes good on top

114
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,720
of looking good. Absolutely. Let's go to

115
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
health secrets for the Hollywood hair

116
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,000
you all want. We've got three wonderful

117
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,599
victims here. Jennifer, Lindsay, and

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,959
Stacy. We're putting them all to the

119
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,280
test. Jennifer's going to get the

120
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,640
Katherine Zetta Jones approach. What do

121
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,239
we know about Katherine Zita Jones?

122
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,239
Well, her hair is long, shiny, and

123
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,879
gorgeous. Right. So, we want to take one

124
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,280
of her tips, and it happens to be beer.

125
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,799
A nice cold beer. Yes. You're kidding

126
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,080
when she drinks it. No, no, no. She

127
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,760
doesn't drink it. Don't drink the beer

128
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,599
for shiny hair. What she does is she

129
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,040
puts it in her hair, rinses it through,

130
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,639
kind of leaves it in for about 20

131
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,400
minutes, and then she shampoos and

132
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
conditions it like normal. She doesn't

133
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,199
smell like beer all day long. She might,

134
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,320
but I don't think anybody has a problem

135
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,680
with that, right, guys? No. I like And

136
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,280
what what kind of beer do you use? You

137
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
know what? It doesn't matter what kind

138
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,479
of beer you use, but it shouldn't be

139
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,880
right out the refrigerator. It should be

140
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,320
warm and flat. So, when your husbands

141
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
are leaving beer around the house, we

142
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,440
finally have a good use for it, ladies.

143
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,880
We like it. Yeah. You know, I didn't

144
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,639
realize this was true, but stylists have

145
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,919
been using this for years. So instead of

146
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,360
paying a lot of money for that, use as

147
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,280
you mentioned the used up stuff for the

148
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,400
the damaged hair repair kit that you

149
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,919
want. Absolutely. It leaves your hair

150
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,320
shiny until it's the proteins in it.

151
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,639
Really happy smell. Sure. It's happy

152
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,440
hour hair. It is happy. That's exactly

153
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,280
what it smells like. Just came. What do

154
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,040
you think about it so far? I can always

155
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,120
use something for dry ends and for more

156
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,479
shine. So I love beer. We're enjoying

157
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,320
the beer. You can drink the leftovers,

158
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,240
by the way. Good for you. Cheers. Oh,

159
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,400
you can't get it. You can't drink. Next

160
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,320
up is Lindsay. She's trying the Denise

161
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Richards healthy hair secret. Yes.

162
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,199
Denise Richards has gone to the avocado.

163
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,720
Good fatty acids in avocado. And what's

164
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,080
great, she has her shower cap wine. What

165
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
she's going to do is she's going to mix,

166
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,479
mash up one ripe avocado, pour in a

167
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,240
tablespoon of olive oil, make a paste,

168
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,000
and put it on her ends. You know, our

169
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,440
ends get really dry, ladies, especially

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,280
with the weather. So, she's going to put

171
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
it on her hair and then put the shower

172
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
cap on and bake it in there for about 20

173
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,080
to 30 minutes. And how often do you

174
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
normally have to do that? Well, you

175
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,960
should do it about twi once every two

176
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,479
weeks unless you are a flat iron or blow

177
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,400
drying addict, which most of the people

178
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,639
in this audience probably are. And you

179
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,000
should up that avocado and do it maybe

180
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
once a week. How often would you have to

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,840
use it? Um, well, I I need to I deep

182
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,759
condition my hair every couple months

183
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,199
because I get highlights. So, I think it

184
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
would be important for me to do it every

185
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,240
couple weeks at least. And when you have

186
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,400
something left over, chips and dip

187
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,120
always look. Exactly. Yep. Chips and

188
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,880
dip. Chips and dip. Thank you, Lindsay.

189
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
All right. Last up is a Hollywood secret

190
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,919
from Blake Lively and Stacy's trying

191
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,759
out. What's Blake's secret? She has it

192
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,039
now. Well, Blake literally got this from

193
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,280
her mama. What it is is mayonnaise,

194
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,520
which is filled with fat as well. A lot

195
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,880
of us have balayage. We have highlights.

196
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,039
You probably have highlights all through

197
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,120
your hair, but the most dangerous part

198
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,039
is the bottom. It really gets ratty. So,

199
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
you take matte mayonnaise, you put it at

200
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,039
the bottom, you massage it in. Now, this

201
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,560
is different than the avocado. What

202
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,160
Blake does is she goes into the shower,

203
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,400
shampoos her hair with the mayonnaise

204
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,319
on. And usually what shampoo does is it

205
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,160
strips the dirt and the oil from your

206
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,919
scalp, but it also when you're washing

207
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,840
the bottom, it doesn't strip the oils

208
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,440
from the bottom because the mayonnaise

209
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,800
the mayonnaise protects it. Oh, I love

210
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,319
that. What do you normally do for your

211
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,240
split ends? Oh, I have to put lots of

212
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,240
conditioner at the bottom, lots of

213
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,639
product, and flat iron it. Well, this is

214
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,479
cheaper. I got to say it's cheaper. Very

215
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,000
good. A good use. Another good use for

216
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,440
mayo. Absolutely. Thank And how long do

217
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
you keep it on? You keep it on about 20

218
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,160
to 30 minutes before you go into the

219
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,080
shower. And then you shampoo it and

220
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
condition as usual. The summer time

221
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,400
especially, you need this, right? You

222
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,080
know what I love about it? It has

223
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,520
natural oils in it. So, it actually will

224
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,800
help lubricate the hair, moisturize it

225
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,240
as well as your scalp. Let's get a

226
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,160
little closer up there. All right. Thank

227
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
you very much, D. Next up, let's get to

228
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,319

times. The celebrities are out playing.

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,039
out from behind the curtain. They have

237
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,400
tried these treatments cuz I actually

238
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,000
want to see what they look like. Kim

239
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
Kardashian's health secret. What is it?

240
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,960
I mean, we're going to follow anything

241
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,440
she does apparently with all her Twitter

242
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,120
followers. She is all about sugar. A

243
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,680
little bit of sugar goes a long way.

244
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,560
What she does is she takes sugar and

245
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,039
puts it in her body wash. Washes her

246
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,759
body all over from head to toe. Smooth,

247
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,440
glowy skin. That simple. That simple.

248
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,120
Kristen, tried it. Come on out.

249
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,840
Oh, she's dressed. How do you feel? Out

250
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,319
of the cabana. She's sweet, but you

251
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,800
smell sweet. Yes. So, how did it go for

252
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,680
you? It was great. Like, what I did was

253
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,000
I just put it on um I mixed my sugar

254
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,599
with my body wash.

255
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,960
And I put it on like that. Right in the

256
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,560
shower. Right in the shower. Put all

257
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,400
over your body. Yeah. And then I rinse

258
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,680
off and I feel just like a Kardashian.

259
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,039
She feels like a Kardashian. Well,

260
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,639
there's lots of products out there that

261
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,639
have sugar scrub, but this is chemical

262
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,720
free, totally organic. This is the way

263
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,840
to go. But, you know, I use brown sugar,

264
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
by the way, which is not an accident.

265
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,399
You should use brown sugar over

266
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,760
granulated sugar. It's a little less

267
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,760
irritating, especially if you got

268
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,880
sensitive skin. It's a great idea. Here,

269
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,360
take the rest of sugar with you can have

270
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,560
it all. Parting gift for Dr. Thank you

271
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,000
very much. The least I could do,

272
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,680
literally. All right, let's get to

273
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,240
another health secret for a beach buy.

274
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,160
This one is from JLo. What's her secret?

275
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
Oh, well, JLo, again, we all watch

276
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,279
American Idol just to see how gorgeous

277
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
she is. She's so smart. that body of

278
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:58,080
hers at age 46.

279
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,240
She sniffs grapefruit extract. Okay. To

280
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,839
suppress her appetite. What do you think

281
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,120
about that, Dr. Als? Do you approve?

282
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,399
Well, she was on the show and that's

283
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,160
when I learned she was doing this. And

284
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,839
there's actually data. It's in animals,

285
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,519
but it works. But she's data in her that

286
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,800
it works, too. So, I like the idea. I

287
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,920
wanted to ask Latrice, who's in our

288
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,360
audience, to try it out. She's in the

289
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,600
comic. Come on out, Latrice.

290
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,519
Well, she looks wonderful. Hungry. I'm

291
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
always hungry.

292
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,080
So, we gave you some of this grapefruit

293
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,839
extract. You've been using it for a

294
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,320
while. What do you think? You know what?

295
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,760
It is so awesome. What I do is I sniff

296
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,959
it every time I'm hanging out with like

297
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,399
my girlfriends or different things like

298
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,240
that because I'm always hungry. Peer

299
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,680
pressure eating. Major, major, major.

300
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,760
And then they want to know, "How do you

301
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,120
stay so slim?" And I said, "I'm using

302
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,160
grapefruit extract." And my girlfriend's

303
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,200
like, "Give me some. You always have it

304
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,320
in your purse." I'm like, "Uhuh. You

305
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
have to go get your own." Exactly.

306
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,519
Right. You fight for a claw at it. You

307
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,000
do. So, actually, you know what? I feel

308
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,080
that I look better than you know Dr. Oz.

309
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,360
Pose girl pose. I like that. I like

310
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,839
that. She twirls. Go ahead. Go ahead and

311
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,160
give it to us. Give it to us.

312
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,279
They again, it's hard to study this

313
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,640
stuff in humans, but as I mentioned,

314
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,839
they use this in rats and it shows that

315
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,440
it actually lowers appetite. And for

316
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,279
that reason, the rats ate less. Yes.

317
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,800
Thank you very much. Snack on, girl. All

318
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,200
right. One more celeb health secret.

319
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,200
This one is from Selma Hayak. Selma's 48

320
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
years old and looks fantastic for her

321
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
age. What is her secret? Yeah, this is

322
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,519
actually my favorite, so listen up. This

323
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,680
is called dry brushing. Now, the same

324
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
sort of idea of sugar scrubbing the dead

325
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,839
skin off of your your skin, your arms,

326
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,160
your body. This you do before you get in

327
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,240
the shower and it gets off all that

328
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,519
extra layer. So, you go in there already

329
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,600
smooth and then you can do the sugar

330
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,600
afterwards. This is She swears by it.

331
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
She gets in there and she's yummy. Come

332
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,200
over here. I'm going to I'm going to

333
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,120
fence you on guard. Yes. Do we have a

334
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,680
subject? Cassie, please come out, my

335
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,160
dear. There she is.

336
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,279
Hi. So, you've been trying this and if

337
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,399
you if you bear with us, we're going to

338
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,160
actually show everyone else what we've

339
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,160
been doing to you. So, use which side?

340
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,519
The hard side like this or No, this is

341
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,920
not it's not dominatrix. We're not

342
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,880
spanking anybody. This is to slough off

343
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,360
dead skin. So, how do you do it? So, we

344
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,360
go brush up. We brush up. How does that

345
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,560
feel? Not too bad, actually. Okay. I

346
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,839
actually like it. I think it feels

347
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,519
really good. And I It feels kind of like

348
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,640
a massage. Yeah. You get addicted to it,

349
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,800
I have to say. And you start going,

350
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,560
"Where's my dry brush? I need to slough

351
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,079
off some if you go like this." No, no,

352
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
no, no. You don't want to do that. You

353
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,399
really want to do it towards the heart

354
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,160
for circulation to let the blood flow.

355
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,360
And you do it on your legs, too. I'll do

356
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,720
it, too. Like, why not? I don't want to

357
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,279
be left out. Actually, I just wanted to

358
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,560
cuz it feels so dang good. You can get

359
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,640

360
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,839
did. It really It's really nice. Feels

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,000
good when you're doing it and afterwards

as well. And you feel soft and smooth.

363
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,680
It's like a baby's bottom. And I think

dr.com. I'll be right

370
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,279
back. Coming up, some may argue that

371
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,360
faith and health are unrelated, but this

372
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,000
doctor says that the power of prayer can

373
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,920
reduce the risk of stress and add years

374
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,480
to your life. Can the power of prayer

375
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,839
help you heal? Prayer can cure disease.

376
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,839
Coming up next, suit up for summer with

377
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,519
detox week. All week long, I'm going to

That's coming up on Monday.

383
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:22,560
God saved my life. A direct answer to

384
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,480
thousands and thousands of prayers.

385
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,720
The big conversation today, can the

386
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,320
power of prayer help you heal? Kent

387
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,839
Brantley, the doctor who was treated for

388
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,240
Ebola and recently released from the

389
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,240
hospital, credited prayer and God with

390
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,160
helping him heal. I've seen too many

391
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,079
miracles as a practicing surgeon to

392
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,760
ignore the potential power of prayer.

393
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,440
And I'm not the only one. The doctor

394
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,440
you're about to meet has tangible

395
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,720
evidence that the power of prayer can

396
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:51,040
actually help you heal. Meet Dr. Harold

397
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,160
Koig. I am a trained medical scientist

398
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,440
and a physician. My primary training is

399
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,040
to conduct research in an objective and

400
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,360
scientific manner. But I do believe that

401
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,800
there is something

402
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,480
more that is the power of prayer. A

403
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,120
professor of psychiatry at Duke

404
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,279
University, Dr. Harold Koig is a pioneer

405
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,680
in connecting the worlds of medicine and

406
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,040
spirituality and identifying the link

407
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,200
between prayer and health.

408
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,440
He's even seen the effects of prayer on

409
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,519
his own well-being. Prayer has helped me

410
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,240
a lot in terms of dealing with my own

411
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,800
chronic pain that I've had for 20 to 30

412
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,880
years. Dr. Koig is convinced that people

413
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,519
who are religious lead much healthier

414
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,079
lives and that the power of prayer is so

415
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,160
profound it can add 7 to 14 years to

416
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,720
your lifespan. He didn't learn about it

417
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,800
in medical school, but Dr. Koenig firmly

418
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,519
believes that practicing religion and

419
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,600
prayer can be for many people a crucial

420
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,320
key to healing. People need more than

421
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,959
just medicine or surgery, it helps a

422
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,360
lot, but it's not enough. And that's

423
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,360
kind of where faith enters into the

424
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:04,160
picture. The world's top expert on

425
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,079
religion and health, Dr. Harold Coney,

426
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,800
is joining us. Do you think prayer can

427
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,920
really heal or cure disease? I think

428
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,079
that prayer can heal and cure disease.

429
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,120
But you know, it doesn't happen very

430
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,240
often that it that a person prays and

431
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,279
the disease is gone. Most of the time we

432
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,680
pray and and we we get the strength to

433
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,399
endure the condition. And you know, when

434
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,600
we're coping better with a condition, we

435
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,880
actually do better

436
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,120
physiologically. So it's been preciously

437
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,480
difficult to actually find hard data in

438
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,320
this area. I've done research in this

439
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
area. others have as well. But I want to

440
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
show you if I can some, you know, very

441
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,079
new research that's just come out. These

442
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,160
are images from a recent study u that

443
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,519
Dr. Con brought to my attention. And

444
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,399
they did a study looking at people who

445
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,120
are at risk of depression. Uh this image

446
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,199
uh shows the area of the brain that that

447
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,199
makes decisions, the area that senses

448
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,000
things. This is the area down here that

449
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,279
remembers things. Now this image is a

450
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
compilation of people's brains who were

451
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,160
depressed and had not done any prayer

452
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,600
around that issue. And the purple

453
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,839
signifies that there's actually a

454
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,000
thinning of the part of the brain. Let

455
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,680
me show you the second scan now. Same

456
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,279
kind of thing. They collected images of

457
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,399
people who are high risk for depression.

458
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,399
For example, their parents were

459
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,000
depressed. Uh and these people had

460
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:27,360
prayed. Notice the red and the yellow

461
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,839
marks. These yellow areas and red areas

462
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,160
show us that the brain is actually

463
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:34,480
thicker. It's compensated by being able

464
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,920
to cope better with what's going on.

465
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,560
This is the first evidence that I've

466
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,240
seen of the power of prayer on the brain

467
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,600
that's physically actually changed our

468
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,000
brains. It's as though the brains were

469
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,680
doing bicep curls in order to make it a

470
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
bit stronger. And in part because of

471
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,519
this, some researchers have argued that

472
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,880
prayer can help reduce the incidence of

473
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,519
depression, a very difficult to treat

474
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,000
problem by 90%.

475
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,399
That's a big statement. Now, what about

476
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,639
people who aren't overtly religious but

477
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,639
are spiritual? Does the impact seem to

478
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,639
reside there as well? Well, you know,

479
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,199
people who are spiritual and who are not

480
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,040
particularly religious, um, they are

481
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,399
going to derive benefit from things like

482
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,680
meditation where it's not so much

483
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,639
focused on religion. But you know uh

484
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,759
when people pray in the context of a

485
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,519
relationship with God with with with the

486
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,759
with God whom they see as a friend who

487
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,000
can come into their lives and give them

488
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,399
strength and hope that really seems to

489
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,800
make an additional difference. I noticed

490
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,920
that the military is doing work on on

491
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,120
spirituality. They actually have

492
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,120
concluded that it's important for the

493
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,360
resilience of folks in the military who

494
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,600
are struggling. You've actually given a

495
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,519
number out of how much benefit prayer

496
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,759
might offer to us quoting a number I

497
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,920
believe around 7 10 maybe even 14 years

498
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,000
of longevity. How do you get those

499
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,079
numbers? Well, you know, religious

500
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,079
involvement including prayer seems to

501
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,720
affect our bodies in many different

502
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,519
ways. It affects our minds in terms of

503
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,679
how we cope with stress and illness. It

504
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,720
affects our health behaviors, how we

505
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:12,079
live our lives, whether we exercise,

506
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,640
what we eat, uh our smoking habits, our

507
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,439
drinking habits, and it also surrounds

508
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,559
us with a faith community to provide

509
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,360
support for us during hard times. So,

510
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,360
all of those factors seem to affect our

511
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,240
physical health and extend our

512
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,840
longevity. I I called my buddies who

513
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,440
work at real age, which is a great way

514
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,440
of assessing how old your body thinks

515
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,840
you are. And their numbers were not too

516
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,120
different from yours if if it reduces

517
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,400
stress, which is a big part of this

518
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,160
because we don't want it to be an a

519
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
stressful process to incorporate this

520
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,400
into your life. We showed Dr. Ken

521
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,320
Brantley earlier. He's been very vocal

522
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,960
about the power of prayer. Uh he's

523
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,919
argued that it helped him heal from

524
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,840
Ebola. There are some who question

525
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,360
whether that's true or not. How would

526
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,320
you have an argument with them? How

527
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,200
would you defend Dr. Brantley's beliefs.

528
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,080
Well, I think that his beliefs are

529
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,080
powerful for him and because they are so

530
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,799
powerful for him. Religious beliefs are

531
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,880
one of the most powerful factors that

532
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,360
you can imagine in a person's life and

533
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,320
in their health because he believes that

534
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,480
that probably has affected his immune

535
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,679
system in various ways that have made

536
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,880
him stronger and more able to resist the

537
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,440
virus. Now you know can we say that this

538
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,679
is not a miraculous

539
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,000
Godcaused cure of him? No, we can't.

540
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,919
Science cannot answer that question. But

541
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,120
what we can do, we can say that because

542
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,760
of his positive attitudes that his body

543
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,760
was probably more able to fight off this

544
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,200
virus. Dr. Thank you very much. You

545
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,960
know, religion is a deeply emotional and

546
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,080
personal topic obviously and some may

547
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,520
argue that faith and health are

548
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,440
unrelated, but the connection has always

549
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,559
seemed very real in my practice. In

550
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,480
fact, I think practicing medicine

551
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,000
without a spiritual or religious element

552
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,760
is a departure from the norm of history

553
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,520
since the first healers, all of the

554
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,600
first healers pretty much were spiritual

555
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,600
leaders as well. So, religion does help

556
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,919
cope with social problems. It helps cope

557
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,280
with uh with life in general. And I

558
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
think we ought to embrace every tool

559
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,960
that helps as long as people don't feel

560
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,480
judged or uncomfortable in the process.

561
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,840
That's an important element because I

562
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
don't want people feeling that way. Tell

563
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,039
us what you think. You can join the

564
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,480
conversation at dr.com and tell us if

565
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,080
you think the power of prayer can help

566
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,080
heal. We'll be right back.

567
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,080
Next. Are you waking up in the middle of

568
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,400
the night? Mind racing? Heart pounding?

569
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,960
Welcome to the 4 a.m. club. You're not

570
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,039
alone. Uncover unique stress remedies to

571
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,320
stop your mind from racing and keep you

572
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,320
fast asleep.

573
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,950
[Applause]

574
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,320
[Music]

575
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,080
[Applause]

576
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,840
Next. It's happening all over the world

577
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,360
and you may be a part of the club and

578
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,520
not even know it. I'm talking about

579
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,960
women on the age of 50 who wake up in

580
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,000
the middle of the night with their minds

581
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,640
racing and their hearts pounding. Sound

582
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,720
familiar? Yeah. A lot of nodding heads.

583
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,919
Comedian and author Annabelle Gerwitch

584
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,840
calls it the 400 a.m. club. I'm

585
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,200
Annabelle Gurwitch. I'm a 52-year-old

586
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,320
mother, wife,

587
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,640
comedian, author, and I happen to be the

588
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,600
founding

589
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,240
member of the 4:00 a.m.

590
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,760
club. It doesn't take much to be a

591
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,520
member. Whether you had too much coffee

592
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,640
during the day or you're waking up

593
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,320
thinking about what you have to do

594
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,480
tomorrow, we've all been there. We're up

595
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,919
at 4:00 a.m. And it's great to know that

596
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,960
when you wake up in the middle of the

597
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,640
night, you're not alone.

598
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,400
Annabelle's 4:00 a.m. club. We're open.

599
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,039
What's up, Annabelle? Annabelle.

600
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,080
Annabelle. Annabelle. It's 4:00 a.m. and

601
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,440
I'm wide awake. Me, too. I'm up again.

602
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,039
You can check the temperature in your

603
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,960
room, but I think you're just having a

604
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,559
hot flash. I think cookies are like

605
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
needed right now. I don't know if

606
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,080
cookies are a sleep aid. Do you have any

607
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,200
book recommendations? I have a great

608
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,280
recommendation. I just wrote a new book.

609
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:05,120
It's called I see you made an effort.

610
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:06,799
Annabelle. Annabelle. Annabelle.

611
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,039
Right on target. So, what wakes you up

612
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,280
at 4:00 a.m. in the morning? Okay. At

613
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,840
4:00 a.m. I start to wake up and I'm

614
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,640
thinking about the things I forgot to do

615
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,600
2 days ago. The things I forgot to do 25

616
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,760
years ago. Did I give my kid enough

617
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,200
greens? And why did I go to bed with a

618
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,799
sweater wrapped around my waist? And

619
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,360
then I realize it's not a sweater, it's

620
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,679
my waistline. Now it's grown on you.

621
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,679
It's everything. Now you've fielded lots

622
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,480
of calls from women who complain about

623
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,559
this 4 a.m. scenario and there must be

624
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,720
common themes. Yeah. You know, I mean I

625
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,480
since I started the book tour, I've met

626
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,280
women all over the country and I think

627
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,600
it really boils down to stress. We're

628
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,520
really stressed out at this age. So

629
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,360
animal decided to try some rather

630
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,159
unusual stress relievers to help out our

631
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,559
fellow 4omemers. Take a look. Ladies,

632
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,880
thank you so much for coming over. I've

633
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,440
come up with some stress relievers that

634
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,280
will help us get a little extra sleep

635
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,760
tonight. Are you ready to try something

636
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,400
unconventional? Yes. Are you ready to

637
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,360
get dirty? Yes. Not that kind of, you

638
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,720
know, the right kind of There's a lot of

639
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,039
research that says that singing and in

640
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,480
particular singing together releases

641
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,559
endorphins and that's one of those

642
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,640
happiness hormones. So, I've arranged

643
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,559
for a singing instructor to work with us

644
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,070
and the best part is you don't have to

645
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,720
be a good singer. Well, thank qualify.

646
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:32,520
[Music]

647
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,559
Hey ho, nobody home.

648
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,039
Hey, nobody home. Meat, no drink, no

649
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,480
money.

650
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:43,880
Hey, nobody home. I forgot what I'm

651
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,760
singing.

652
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:51,600
Hey, nobody home for a first try.

653
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,280
I could see singing at 4 a.m. and being

654
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,280
very happy. Not so much my neighbors.

655
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,039
Meditation has been shown to be relaxing

656
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,440
for the brain and I like a moving

657
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,520
meditation. So I thought of dervish

658
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,120
whirling. Dervish whirling is an ancient

659
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,799
technique. It's from the 13th century in

660
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:15,840
Turkey. You guys, are you ready? 1 2 3 4

661
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:18,470
5 and da da da. And d my skirt's not

662
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,240
going out. Okay. All right. Wait.

663
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,480
[Music]

664
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,480
I

665
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,919
overwhelled. People have been doing mud

666
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,240
baths since Roman times, right? People

667
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,240
say it improves your digestion. It

668
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,360
relaxes muscles. This is going to be the

669
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,799
thing. This is going to the amazing

670
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,600
thing is it helps us sleep. I'm going to

671
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,520
help you guys stir up this brew, but I'm

672
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,559
not hopping in. It feels kind of

673
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,679
amazing. It does. It's like playing in

674
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,159
the dirt. This is just so out of my

675
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,880
comfort zone of the normal day that it

676
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,159
just feels so good. Thank you for

677
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,559
inviting me cuz I'm not going to be a

678
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,200
member of the 4:00 a.m. club tonight. Me

679
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,919
neither.

680
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,559
I might be cleaning up till 4:00 a.m.

681
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:07,120
I'm so glad it worked for you guys.

682
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,480
Some very extreme measures. It looked

683
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,960
like dung you were putting into the mud

684
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,279
bath. And it was mud. It was mud from

685
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,799
the Baltic Sea. And my father's from the

686
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,400
part of the world in Turkey where they

687
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,320
actually do the whirling dervishes. But

688
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,559
you get dizzy at age 52 doing that kind

689
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,559
of work. Yes. I I have to say that is

690
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,880
not my distresser. It was the singing

691
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,360
for me. You know, you get so caught up.

692
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,000
You're not you chores, bills, working,

693
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,760
kids, and we were just so joyful and

694
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,120
playing together that we forgot about

695
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,480
those things. And I slept really well

696
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,080
that night. Think about that, folks. I

697
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,520
know it sounds like who has time to go

698
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,960
play? A little bit of it if you can

699
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,320
sleep at 4 in the in the morning is

700
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,640
probably worthwhile. Okay. You got an

701
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,320
emergency kit for all the the folks on

702
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,320
the edge of 50 who might be suffering

703
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,640
from not only 4 a.m. scenarios but other

704
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,679
things as well. Yes. It starts with I'm

705
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,840
supposed to hold this. Is this right?

706
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,320
Yes. Granny panties.

707
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,799
Right. They come. I hold it like this.

708
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,080
Those might be your size. All right.

709
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,760
Exactly. All right. Come over here. Come

710
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,840
on here. All right. So, what do you do

711
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,159
with these? Okay. Why do I Why do I need

712
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,240
granny panties? Well, the granny panties

713
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,640
are really for a sense of humor. Just to

714
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,720
remind you to laugh because in menopause

715
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,400
you need your sense of humor. And if you

716
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,000
also if you wanted some carbohydrates,

717
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,760
you might need those too because you

718
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,520
gain weight so quickly at this age.

719
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:23,200
Okay. Inside here. All right. You ready?

720
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,760
Tweezers. Okay. Tweezers. Tweezers. On

721
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,559
any given day, I can end up with more

722
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,760
chin hairs than my teenage son.

723
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,960
Tweezers. At this age, very important.

724
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,799
Then I've got a great selection here of

725
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,559
reading glasses. I don't need to tell

726
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,640
you why, right? I lose my glasses all

727
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,400
the time. Usually I'm wearing them when

728
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
I'm looking for them. You have to hide

729
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,600
these around the house. I do that too,

730
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,360
by the way. Always. Great. Okay. Then

731
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,159
the most important thing in the kit is

732
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,000
the phone. Why? You're looking at me

733
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,840
like why, Annabelle? Why this? Right.

734
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,480
Well, what I have really found that I

735
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,039
need at this age is community. I need my

736
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,080
girlfriends. Now, my new trick is

737
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,919
exercise dates twice a week. Standing

738
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,600
dates with my girlfriends. So, you get

739
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,000
two things. You get your girlfriend time

740
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,400
and your exercise time together. I have

741
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,080
a well thought through. Lots more of her

742
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,600
wonderful insights. And I see you made

743
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,200
an effort. It's a wonderful book is out

744
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,960
now. Be sure to visit our Facebook page.

745
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,240
Enjoyed it on Annabelle's 4 a.m. Club

746
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,210
Conversations. Here's a home phone

747
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,640
number, by the way. We'll be right back.

748
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,480
[Music]

749
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,200
How do you make sure that you get a good

750
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,279
night's sleep? Meditation. Every night

751
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,360
before bed, I make sure to take at least

752
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,840
15 minutes to meditate. It helps quiet

753
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,640
my mind and relax me. Share your story

754
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,640

facebook.com/d. Next, it's often called

756
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,279
the silent killer. One in every three

757
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,480
adults lives with it. High blood

758
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:50,880
pressure. What you can do to get it

759
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,039
under control and how you can monitor it

760
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,360
right from your own home. Coming

761
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,720
up, suit up for summer with detox week.

762
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,480
All week long, I'm going to show you

763
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,559
different ways to detox your body to

764
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,880
feel healthier, be happier, to look

765
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,360
slimmer. Swaps to lose weight and the

766
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,610
food to jumpst start your energy. That's

767
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,760
coming up on

768
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,760
[Applause]

769
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,960
Monday. A third of the audience is

770
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,360
standing. Now, why is that? Because they

771
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,720
represent the one out of three adults

772
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,919
with high blood pressure. Now, this

773
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,600
season, I'm asking you to take simple

774
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,520
steps to better health. Today, we're

775
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,360
focusing on the very first step I want

776
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,799
everyone to take to get their blood

777
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,400
pressure under control. Now, before I

778
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,600
tell you exactly what that step is, I

779
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,200
need a little help from my assistant of

780
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,000
the day. How about seat number 73? 7. Is

781
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,840
that

782
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,159
you? Well, how are you? Everyone else,

783
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,279
you have a

784
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:46,799
seat. Oh, good. Come on down here. Let

785
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,000
me put this on you real quick. What's

786
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,919
your first name? Joanna. Joanna. Uh, is

787
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,919
that your family back there, friends?

788
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,159
That's my friend Karen. Oh, she's I bet

789
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,080
she was down here. Now, your blood

790
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,000
pressure, what is it? Uh, typically it's

791
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,200
normal. 110 over 75ish. Oh, you have

792
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,279
good blood pressure. Unless I'm really

793
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,640
excited. They're like, "Now, come come

794
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,480
sit. We're going to check your blood

795
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,399
pressure." I have a remarkable effect on

796
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,039
people. I can raise anybody's blood

797
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,440
pressure. All right. So, here, put your

798
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,360
arms right through there and let me just

799
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,960
see what it is. And you sit there and

800
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,399
try to make the world a calm place with

801
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,159
all these people watching you. and we'll

802
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,520
put these numbers on. And while I tell

803
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,880
you this about this a little bit, you

804
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,000
you ignore me. You're just concentrating

805
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,760
on your blood pressure and relaxing

806
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,279
yourself. Now, you want to use a wide

807
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,880
range cuff. These cuffs I just put on

808
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,480
are designed for different sizes of arms

809
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,679
so you don't get the wrong number for

810
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,440
yourself. And remember, the blood

811
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,120
pressure is the number everybody of the

812
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,240
blood rushing against your blood

813
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,000
vessels. The top number is designed to

814
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,679
tell us exactly how hard your heart pump

815
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,039
blood into your blood vessels, how

816
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,880
pushed them out and engorged them with

817
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,080
blood. The lower number tells us when

818
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,000
your heart's not pumping, when your

819
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,679
heart's relaxed, how much you relax, how

820
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,440
much your blood vessels are able to open

821
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,440
up and let blood flow through them. So,

822
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,520
the ideal blood pressure is anything

823
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,440
below 120 over 80 over there. That green

824
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,840
light that I'm identifying. Anything

825
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,559
between 120 and 140 over 90 is called

826
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,360
the orange area. That's called

827
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,559
prehypertension. You ideally don't want

828
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
to be there. It's better off if you're

829
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,679
not there. You want to be in that green

830
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,399
light area if possible. Anything in the

831
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,960
red zone, 140 over 90 or above, we don't

832
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,960
want that. and your blood pressure.

833
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,399
Well, your lower number is great, 76.

834
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,360
Your higher number, because of me, I'll

835
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,799
take the blame on this, is 163. But, but

836
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,399
that that's because you're a bunch of

837
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,520
folks around you in your life. The

838
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,799
beauty of what I'm going to talk to you

839
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,320
about today is the fact that when we go

840
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,919
to doctor's offices and we have that

841
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,960
white jacket that you're wearing on, we

842
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,240
raise your blood pressure. When you're

843
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,679
rushing to get to the office, it goes

844
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,600
up. The best place to take your blood

845
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,679
pressure is at home. That's when it's

846
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,440
going to be nice and low, especially to

847
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,840
keep your spouse out of it and let

848
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,600
everything happen. But the reality is

849
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,520
because so many of us have high blood

850
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,919
pressure and we don't have symptoms.

851
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,440
It's called the silent killer. It's the

852
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,720
most important thing to pay attention

853
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,080
to. If you don't know your number, you

854
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,159
can't deal with it. All right, let's get

855
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,279
you up. Let me walk you over here

856
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,200
because I'm going to show you why I care

857
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,120
so much about blood pressure. And you're

858
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,799
going to love this. And it has to do

859
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,320
with your blood vessels. So, we got two

860
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,240
blood vessels here, right? And both

861
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,159
blood vessels are normal. They both

862
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,919
could take you to your old age or having

863
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,000
any problems. But the water which is the

864
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,919
blood in your body can either come in a

865
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,919
very gentle way sort of like like this

866
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,240
gently massaging the inside of the blood

867
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,200
vessel you know interestingly touching

868
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,640
it delicately nudging it right that's

869
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,559
what you want a blood pressure that's in

870
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,159
that green zone like there won't have

871
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,919
any damaging effects to your blood

872
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,399
vessel so you don't have to fix poles

873
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,559
and problems but if your blood pressure

874
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,159
is that of a fire hydrant right and

875
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,840
instead of being that nice number that I

876
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,480
mentioned earlier You're more like, I

877
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,840
don't know, have like a jet engine,

878
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,679
right? And you do this to your blood

879
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,880
vessel wall. Watch what happens. You see

880
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,880
ripping off the edge there. Tearing it

881
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,559
up. Exactly. Right. And as you tear it

882
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,440
up, now you're left with a blood vessel

883
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,600
wall that's got a big gap in it. And

884
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,080
when that gap is there, see all this

885
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,080
down here? This material, this is the

886
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,480
blood vessel that's being ripped. And

887
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
your body has to fix this. So see this

888
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,679
dark area that's left without a

889
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,120
covering? This teflon like covering is

890
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,600
missing. Your body has to repair that.

891
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,840
It puts down plaque with cholesterol.

892
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,600
All kinds of bad stuff happens when this

893
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,679
delicate lining is ripped off with high

894
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,600
blood pressure. So, we don't want that.

895
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,760
Instead, what we want to do is to figure

896
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,240
out ways of preventing it. Now, under

897
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,080
these sheets, I've gotten examples of

898
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,760
what happens over the long period of

899
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,120
time if we tolerate that. You put your

900
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,120
purple gloves on. The first specimen is

901
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,720
pretty riveting. I'm coming down again

902
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,480
if we have to. We'll do it at the very

903
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,279
end. How's that? I'll race you for blood

904
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,760
pressure at the end. Okay. This is the

905
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,200
aorta, the major tube that carries blood

906
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,159
in the body. And you see these little

907
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,240
chips? Yes. Go ahead and touch those.

908
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,840
That's like the torn up red in there.

909
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Well, that's what happens when that torn

910
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,240
up red is replaced by plaque. These are

911
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,919
little

912
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,320
plaques. Little chips here. Describe

913
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,399
them to everybody. They're uh hard.

914
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,240
Yeah. Much hard. Bony. Much harder than

915
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,440
I expected. Bony is interesting. It's a

916
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,880
good way to describe it. It's not

917
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,240
supposed to be like this table. It feels

918
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,559
like the table. It's supposed to be like

919
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,880
a very rubbery substance and it's not

920
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,880
that anymore. And then over time as this

921
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,960
becomes rigid and unable to allow the

922
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,200
blood to pass normally, your heart will

923
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,960
change from this beautiful little baby

924
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,080
size of your fist, nice and elegant,

925
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,760
right? About the right size to this. Oh,

926
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,840
this is a heart that's faced high blood

927
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,360
pressure and burnt out from working hard

928
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,039
every single day. Since I've been

929
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,559
talking, your heart's beaten a couple

930
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,840
hundred times. All of ours has. And if

931
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,000
we're pumping against that high pressure

932
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,440
that I showed earlier, it's a problem.

933
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,120
So, we don't want to have this in our

934
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,360
life. We don't want to experience any of

935
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,519
this. And the first step, the first step

936
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,519
is to know your blood pressure and

937
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,960
monitor at home to avoid crazy numbers

938
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,799
that aren't accurate. So, take your

939
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,760
gloves off here. Let's go through this.

940
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,640
How often do you check your blood

941
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,159
pressure? At the doctor, once a year. At

942
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,640
the doctor, once a year. Yeah. You know,

943
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,240
we you know why we used to do that? It

944
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,320
was the only thing we had available.

945
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,480
There was no other way of doing it. But

946
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,000
research without any question shows the

947
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,440
best place to do it is at home. So, I

948
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,919
could come visit you at home. Sure.

949
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,279
Sure. Okay. But but most doctors aren't

950
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,600
going to do that. The best thing to do

951
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,039
is to figure out an atome blood pressure

952
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,159
monitoring system that works for you.

953
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,760
I'm going to give you my guidelines real

954
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,840
quickly. You're going to settle down,

955
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,519
sit in your in place for five minutes

956
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,440
without moving with your feet on the

957
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,880
floor with no one bothering you. And

958
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,320
then you're going to start off initially

959
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,840
by taking your blood pressure in both

960
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,799
arms because they can be different. And

961
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,919
you want to know if there's a

962
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,600
difference. There are lots of reasons

963
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,039
for that, but you should know that. And

964
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,960
if there is a difference for more than

965
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,720
10 millimeters of mercury, then you

966
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,559
actually want to be to call it to your

967
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,760
doctor's attention. You can use a wrist

968
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,960
monitor if you want. And if you use a

969
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,399
wrist monitor, this is an example of

970
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,840
one. You want to put it up by your

971
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,960
heart. It'll tell you there's a little

972
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,399
light on there. It'll tell you where to

973
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,000
put it like you're pledging allegiance

974
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,360
to the flag. And that little light will

975
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,640
light up and it'll let you know that

976
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,399
you're in the right spot. So arm or

977
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,640
wrist, they'll both work great. You want

978
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,760
to do this for a week, twice a day. Then

979
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,279
you'll know what your true blood

980
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,480
pressure is. You we all have ups and

981
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,159
downs, but you'll know generally. And

982
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,760
then after that, you can go, you know,

983
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,880
to once a month or more regularly,

984
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,799
depending if your blood pressure is high

985
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,720
or low. Does everything I'm saying makes

986
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,919
sense? Yes. And yeah, we live in an era

987
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,440
where we can know this. Why not take

988
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,360
advantage of it? All season long, the

989
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,720

next. Now, I've been telling you that

1035
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,240
small steps can make a big impact on

1036
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,880
your health. One mom and her family are

1037
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,800
proving just that. Lisa Leak overhauled

1038
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,640
the food in her home and change her

1039
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,800
family's health. How'd she do it? She

1040
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,079
shopped the supermarket like a pro, and

1041
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,079
she's here to show you how to do the

1042
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,839
exact same thing. Welcome to the show,

1043
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,839
Lisa. So, how'd you overhaul your

1044
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,760
family's food? Well, a few years ago, we

1045
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,119
had a huge wakeup call when we started

1046
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,560
researching the foods that we were

1047
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,920
eating and realized that a lot of the

1048
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,920
foods we thought were healthy were

1049
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,680
actually highly processed. So we

1050
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,960
challenged our family to take a 100 days

1051
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,280
of real food pledge. 100 days. Yes. Now

1052
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,720
how do they respond to that? Well, we

1053
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,400
certainly explained to the children that

1054
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,920
we were doing this for our health and I

1055
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,599
think children generally want to do the

1056
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,760
right thing. So they were on board once

1057
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,960
we told them the reasons behind it. What

1058
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,560
kind of results did you get? Did the

1059
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,839
folks feel healthier or not really? You

1060
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,440
know, we didn't expect to have any

1061
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,960
immediate changes to our health. So we

1062
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,920
were really surprised when my husband

1063
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,599
lost 10 pounds. I had more energy. My

1064
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,160
youngest daughter's constipation

1065
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,040
basically went away overnight. Also, her

1066
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,880
asthma improved so much and my good

1067
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,440
cholesterol, the number that you want to

1068
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,520
be high went up by 50%. I couldn't

1069
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,599
believe it. Yeah, that's ab and this is

1070
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,119
again small steps done right. The way

1071
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,320
you describe it makes incredible

1072
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,520
impacts. Come on over here. Okay, let's

1073
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,280
get to the tips on how to shop the

1074
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,520
supermarket like a pro. The first thing

1075
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,599
you are you need to do is to buy fast

1076
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,040
and easy food staples, things that you

1077
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,640
have to have on your shopping cart. Yes.

1078
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,320
Now, while it's ideal to shop the

1079
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,160
perimeter of the of the store and to get

1080
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,000
lots of fresh produce, it's not always

1081
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,599
realistic for a busy family. So, these

1082
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,760
are some of the staples I do buy from

1083
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,760
the middle of the store. Starting with

1084
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,560
um whole grain crackers and cereal.

1085
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,480
These are 100% whole wheat pas. These

1086
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,800
fruit leathers are a great little snack

1087
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,320
and treat for my kids. And also, you can

1088
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,000
find fruit and nut bars that only have

1089
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,520
two or three ingredients, so I always

1090
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,800
have one of those stashed in the bottom

1091
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,200
of my purse. And I love popcorn. I also

1092
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960
love that it's 100% whole grain snack.

1093
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,560
And I want to show you a little trick.

1094
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,880
You can take just a third of cup of

1095
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,359
kernels, put it in a brown paper lunch

1096
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,599
bag, and then you just fold over the top

1097
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,560
and you can microwave this and make your

1098
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,160
own microwave popcorn with no additives

1099
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,839
or unwanted chemicals. So, you just put

1100
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,440
it in for about 3 or 3 and 1/2 minutes

1101
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,040
and it's done. And folks, doesn't cost

1102
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,640
very much. It's a paper bag basically.

1103
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,240
You got it done. All right. And over

1104
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,320
here we have foods that you think we

1105
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,680
shouldn't be getting. These are are food

1106
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,280
you are because they make health claims.

1107
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,440
you might want to be wary about.

1108
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,680
Exactly. So, like this says it's all

1109
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,760
natural and it might be, but natural is

1110
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,000
not a term that's regulated. So, you

1111
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,079
have to read the ingredients to be sure.

1112
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,599
So, it was difficult for us to figure

1113
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,440
all these things out, but once I figured

1114
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,599
it out, it's so much easier now. And you

1115
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,920
teach the kids. Okay. Lastly, you say

1116
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,000
shop in season. Yes, that is a great way

1117
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,320
to save money. And I have a tip for you.

1118
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,839
So, berries, for example, they are

1119
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,359
definitely a better deal when they're in

1120
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,000
season in the summer. And I actually

1121
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,839
freeze fresh local organic blueberries

1122
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,599
and eat them all winter long. And they

1123
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,200
are so much better than the frozen

1124
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,359
packaged berries that you get from the

1125
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,040
store. And another great tip to get your

1126
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,720
kids involved is if you're in the

1127
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,000
produce section, give them a dollar and

1128
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,359
tell them they can buy whatever they

1129
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,040
want. And that's exactly how I got my

1130
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,480
oldest daughter to eat a cucumber for

1131
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,920
the first time. And she now loves them.

1132
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,599
So I think just because she was able to

1133
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,440
make the choice with a buck. If you can

1134
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,560
get do that, we're well to do. Okay. So

1135
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,240
after shopping, doing all these smart

1136
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,400
things, you said you've could put a

1137
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,240
couple meals together just as an example

1138
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,359
to tantalize you how cool this could be.

1139
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,880
So for breakfast, what do you have for

1140
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,160
us? Well, this is a recipe for my new

1141
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,760
book. These are whole wheat banana

1142
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,839
pancakes. And the great thing about this

1143
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,599
recipe is that the bananas are so sweet.

1144
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,960
It's a great introductory recipe for

1145
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,200
someone who's just getting used to the

1146
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,560
taste of whole wheat. So, and for lunch,

1147
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,560
you've got pita pizzas, which every

1148
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,240
child loves. Yeah, these are so easy.

1149
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,560
You just take those whole wheat pas and

1150
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,400
I use jarred organic tomato sauce from

1151
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,839
the grocery store and grated mozzarella

1152
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,760
and you can toast them in the oven or

1153
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,520
the toaster oven. And I actually make

1154
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,119
big batches of these in advance and

1155
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,119
freeze them for my kids school lunches

1156
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,200
and I pack them cold and they love them.

1157
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,040
They eat them up and this looks like a

1158
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,280
lot of work. This is a slow cooker.

1159
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,359
Yeah, this No, this is so easy. So, this

1160
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,800
is the most popular recipe on my blog. I

1161
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,720
call it the best whole chicken in the

1162
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,240
slow cooker. You basically rub some

1163
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,920
spices on the chicken and you put it in

1164
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,000
the slow cooker with an onion. No need

1165
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,400
to add any liquid. And then you cook it

1166
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,079
on high for 4 hours and is like tender

1167
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,000
falling off the bone. This cannot be

1168
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,280
that good. It is so good. And especially

1169
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,440
if you have a recipe where you need to

1170
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,839
use cooked chicken, this is how I always

1171
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,760
make it. And then the best thing to do

1172
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,359
is you take the bones after you're done

1173
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,200
eating the chicken, put them back in the

1174
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,880
slow cooker, fill it with water, leave

1175
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,640
the cooking juices in there, add some

1176
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,079
veggie scraps, and I make homemade

1177
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,320
chicken broth overnight while I'm

1178
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,440
sleeping. So, you make something with

1179
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,920
ingredients you would have thrown away

1180
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,599
anyway. I love it. And finally, popcorn,

1181
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,040
which I think is the best snack for

1182
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,040
those of you who have issues late at

1183
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,560
night. This is this you is that is that

1184
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,480
cinnamon on there? Yes, this is cinnamon

1185
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,920
glazed popcorn. And just because you're

1186
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,240
on a real food diet doesn't mean you

1187
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,720
can't have a sweet tooth. I love to make

1188
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,400
this. You just mix melted um butter and

1189
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,320
honey and cinnamon and ginger together

1190
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,560
and you bake it on a low temperature

1191
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,079
together. And I always give this to the

1192
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,839
teachers for holiday gifts every year

1193
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,119
with a little recipe card and it's a big

1194
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,520
hit. Does it help with the grades at

1195
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,280
all? They're getting good grades to

1196
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,480
begin with. I hope I am very proud of

1197
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,160
you. You invested a little bit of

1198
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,359
effort, made those small steps, and now

1199
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,960
you changed the life for you and your

1200
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,720
family. Yes. And the next generation,

1201
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,280
too. Congratulations. You had all of

1202
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,720
Lisa's recipes in her new book, 100 days

1203
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,200
of real food. It's absolutely fabulous.

1204
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,200
I'll be right back.

1205
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,480
All new Oz. Suit up for summer. Detox

1206
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,680
week kicks off with a summer cleanse

1207
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,880
almost anyone can do. All week long, I'm

1208
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,880
going to show you different ways to

1209
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,359
detox your body to feel healthier, be

1210
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,280
happier, and to look slimmer. Swaps to

1211
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,040
lose weight. We made ice cubes that have

1212
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,359
blackberries in it. It's very clever,

1213
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,079
very refreshing. And the summer food to

1214
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,440
jump start your day. I feel amazing. I

1215
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:21,300
have a lot more energy. All new

1216
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:24,409
Oz. That's coming up on Monday.

1217
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,409
[Music]

1218
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,040
It is time for In case you missed this.

1219
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,960
First up, it's our big conversation

1220
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,800
point today. Can the power of prayer

1221
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,560
help you heal? Religion and health

1222
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,079
expert Dr. Harold Coney says yes, and

1223
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,000
he's emphatic about it. He believes that

1224
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,240
prayer can promote healing by reducing

1225
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,960
stress and anxiety, and it actually even

1226
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,480
helps depression by 90%. Now, studies

1227
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,240
have found that physical changes in the

1228
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,480
brain happen in people who are religious

1229
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,839
and pray. And some may argue that faith

1230
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,040
and health are unrelated, but the

1231
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,280
connection has always seemed very real

1232
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,440
to me in my practice. Next, shop the

1233
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,040
supermarket like a pro. One way to do

1234
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,800
this, and this is, I think, pretty

1235
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,240
simple, is realize that it's not

1236
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,440
practical to just shop the perimeter of

1237
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,599
the store, although it's a good place to

1238
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,760
start. You can buy fast and easy food

1239
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,119
staples everywhere. For example, and in

1240
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,400
these packages, I'll give you some some

1241
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,960
of these. You can have whole wheat

1242
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,319
crackers. There's pa puff rice cereal.

1243
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,400
Again, check the ingredients. Fruit

1244
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,440
leathers, these nut bars are fabulous.

1245
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,119
Again, look to make sure you don't have

1246
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,560
25 synthetic things in there, but these

1247
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,319
can be easily found with a little bit of

1248
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,599
homework. Um, and even with things like

1249
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,280
popcorn, you can prepare them as a

1250
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,880
wonderful late night snack. So, let me

1251
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,640
close with a warning. Please be careful

1252
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,920
about what you buy online, especially

1253
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,760
weight loss pills. There are some

1254
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,359
dubious people online that pray on folks

1255
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,960
like you who are trying to do the right

1256
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,000
thing for your health. Sometimes they

1257
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,720
even try to make it seem like I'm

1258
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,760
endorsing their products. I don't. To

1259
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,880
