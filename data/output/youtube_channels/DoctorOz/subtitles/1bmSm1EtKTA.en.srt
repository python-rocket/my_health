1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,600
Let's look inside the yolk of an egg. We

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,320
investigate brand new science. Now we're

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,160
discovering that it may have a dark side

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,480
that may change the way you think about

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,719
your morning meal. They create a toxic

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,760
chemical. Should we go back to eating

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,320
just egg whites again? Plus muscle hot

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,720
dog. Hot dog. It was a challenge, but we

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,430
finally found an Oz approved hot dog.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:31,840
And the winner is coming up next.

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:36,440
[Music]

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,440
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,250
[Music]

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,220
I love you,

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,689
[Music]

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,689
[Applause]

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,680
Da. Today, we're bringing you brand new

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,840
science about your go-to protein power

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,000
food, eggs. Now, for years, I've stood

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,840
on this stage and told you there is

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,920
nothing wrong with eating the yolk of

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,600
the egg. But science, you know, it's

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
always changing. And some are now

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,799
questioning whether the yolk may

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,640
increase the risk of heart disease and

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,799
stroke. And get this, it doesn't have to

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,159
do with the cholesterol at all. When

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,520
news about something as important as

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
this breaks, I want to be the first to

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,799
bring it to you. So today, we are

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,840
investigating eggs and answering the

32
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,240
question, do we all need to go back to

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,119
eating egg whites again? Joining me now

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,680
is food investigator Alli Rosen.

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,439
This is this is crazy. In my in my short

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,520
career as a doctor, we've gone back and

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,759
forth, back and forth in contention for

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,280
decades. Yeah. So, what's going on now?

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,360
Why can't we figure out whether it's

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,200
good or bad for it's an egg, right?

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Well, to start with, we have to take a

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,360
little trip back to the '9s to really

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,840
understand. So, the '9s gave us a lot of

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,360
great things like flannel and some of my

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,000
favorites, boy bands. Sorry. Um, but it

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,560
also gave us a very strict no yoke

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,719
policy and that really came from

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,200
cholesterol. We found that yolk had a

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,040
lot of cholesterol and so people stopped

50
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,799
having yolks and then we realized a

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
little later as you're saying science is

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,360
always changing. We realized that the

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,840
dietary cholesterol in yolks really has

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,360
nothing to do with our cholesterol. So,

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,720
but some people still haven't caught up.

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
So, that's why we see a lot of egg

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,040
whites on menus. So, just to be clear,

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,280
if your issue is cholesterol, with rare

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,959
exceptions, it's not the egg that's your

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,080
problem. No, not at all. And once we

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,200
realized they shouldn't be villainized

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,720
for cholesterol, then we started to

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,879
discover some really beneficial

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,360
nutrients that egg yolks offered. So,

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,200
let's look inside the yolk of an egg,

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,280
right? Beautiful egg here. And if you

67
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,959
take the yolk off, right, there's

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
something here that's really important

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,640
for you to know about. It's called

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,840
choline and it's found in eggs. And it

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,920
wasn't discovered until

72
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,000
1998. But once it was discovered, it

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,920
became the gold standard nutrient, the

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,239
one that's most important for a lot of

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,680
people. They think now it's essential to

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,440
our brain development, liver function,

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,120
nervous system, metabolism, you know,

78
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,879
all the stuff you need to get from food.

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,560
It's in this choline. And one of the

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,040
best sources for most of you, the best

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,599
actually is egg yolks. So choline

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,760
brought the yolk back into vogue. But

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,400
now we're discovering ally to your point

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,319
that it may have a dark side because

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,920
it's being raised as a concerning issue

86
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,280
for a lot of big-time scientists. My

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,519
good friend and chief wellness officer

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,280
at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Mike Royen

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,519
joins us via Zoom. Mike, congratulations

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,560
because a lot of this research came out

91
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,720
of your institution and it led you to

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,799
give up egg yolks again and you've been

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,400
hammering me on this. literally

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,080
confiscating eggs out of my refrigerator

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,319
when you come to visit. Why? What is the

96
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,879
issue?

97
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,360
That's right. Um, we've been worried

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,720
about the negative health effects of egg

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,519
yolks for a long

100
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,560
time. But it's not the cholesterol per

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,239
se. We were right, but for the wrong

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,879
reason. animal products. Some animal

103
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,360
products and egg yolks in particular

104
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,959
have a lot of what you've said, choline,

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:11,120
a specific choline. And it turns out

106
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:14,640
that that changes the bacteria inside

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,799
our gut. And when they get in the blood,

108
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
they can harm our blood vessel,

109
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,639
increasing our risk for heart disease

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,479
and stroke. Mike, choline, it's

111
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,400
essential as a nutrient for us. is

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,160
present in foods, I guess, for a good

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,240
reason. Is the research, in your

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,240
opinion, really strong enough to say,

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,120
don't get your choline from eggs. Stop

116
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,479
eating the egg yolks. Well, egg yolks

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,919
are very high in choline. But we need

118
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,960
more research on this. And until that's

119
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,720
done, I'm playing it safe. Egg whites

120
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,880
are fine, but at most one egg yolk a

121
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,199
week, especially if they have red meat

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,800
or other things in their diet that

123
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,800
change the bacteria and have those

124
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,960
bacteria increase production of that

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,240
inflammatory chemical. Dr. Rosen, thank

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,759
you. Go back to work. I see the blood

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,840
pressure cuff behind you. Take care of

128
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
some patients. Thank you. So, let's

129
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,960
let's take a closer look at how choline

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,639
can lead to blood clots. I'm going to

131
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
just put a little pictures behind what

132
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,720
Mike was saying. So when some people

133
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,160
ingest choline from foods like eggs, it

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,759
can interact. You put the egg in your

135
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,039
mouth, it goes into your gut. And

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,560
remember he said it can interact with

137
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,039
certain gut bacteria in their

138
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,199
intestines. The gut bacteria digest the

139
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,400
choline and they create a toxic

140
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,000
chemical. And this gut flora it differs

141
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,120
but that toxic chemical doesn't. It's

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,120
the same chemical that causes

143
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,120
inflammation in blood vessels which can

144
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,280
lead to the formation of plaques that

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,120
narrow the arteries. Right? It also

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,479
makes the platelets more sticky. And

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,320
those platelets are important for

148
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,759
clotting, which is good if you got a

149
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,759
cut, right? Skim your knee. It's

150
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,440
fantastic. But it's bad if you happen to

151
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,639
have a problem inside your artery

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,080
because when you have a cut in your

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,240
artery, your body then puts a scab

154
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,960
there, stops the flow of blood, and that

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,120
can cause heart attacks or stroke, all

156
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,560
kinds of headaches. Now, this sounds

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,120
alarming, but I don't want everyone

158
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,039
running scared of yolks just yet because

159
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,039
Ally has some hacks for how you can

160
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,680
potentially reduce the harmful effects

161
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,759
of egg yolks. and I like her ideas a

162
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,520
lot. So, walk us through a few. Yeah, I

163
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,440
do not want to only eat one egg yolk a

164
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,120
week. So, there's a few ingredients that

165
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,600
can kind of counterbalance the effects

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,240
of choline. Uh, cold pressed extra

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,560
virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and

168
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,800
red wine. All things I love eating.

169
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,240
Yeah, exactly. So, apply them. How do I

170
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,840
use them in my food? Right. So, we've

171
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,440
come up with three recipes so that you

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,520
don't have to like drink a glass of wine

173
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,199
every morning for breakfast to help you

174
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,680
counterbalance your eggs. Um, this is

175
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,199
just a baked egg recipe. We use four

176
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,199
tablespoons of olive oil, which is

177
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,360
enough to counterbalance the choline.

178
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,039
Um, it has basil and some sunflower

179
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
seeds, and you just bake it in the oven.

180
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,880
So, that's a really great easy one for

181
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
anyone. This is if you want to get a

182
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,199
little fancier. These are balsamic

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,639
vinegar, deileled eggs, uh, which have

184
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,400
balsamic vinegar, a little bit of garlic

185
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,160
powder. Um, you know, you can use mayo,

186
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,759
but you can also use your favorite of

187
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
Greek yogurt. We've got your kale and

188
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,639
your Greek yogurt today. So, very

189
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,400
exciting. You know, these will be great

190
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,080
with the wine, right? Exactly. You drink

191
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080
them with the wine. And then for a

192
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,960
little bit of breakfast for dinner, we

193
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,240
also do some red wine poached eggs. Um,

194
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,319
which is another great option. You

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,840
really just switch out the water for the

196
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
You switch out the water for the red

197
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,000
wine. You literally poach the eggs in

198
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,599
wine. Yeah, just same regular wine. I'm

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,400
going to have you put a little cheese on

200
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,000
top. Yeah, there we go. Little cheese.

201
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,599
And you can do a little bit of parsley

202
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,039
or basil to kind of give it that color

203
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,960
to go with that. Got to taste this. This

204
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,479
is unbelievable. I love poached eggs.

205
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,680
And this is one that's really great for

206
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,639
if you want to have a dinner party or

207
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,319
you want fancier. Yeah. And you have the

208
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,080
the yolk which Roy's going to go crazy

209
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,280
if he ever sees this. I know. Sorry.

210
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,599
Don't let him see. Thank you. He's back

211
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,599
in the clinic.

212
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,240
This is a real winner, Allie. Exactly.

213
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,680
Yeah. These are easy ways and then you

214
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
don't have to worry about your egg yolks

215
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
and you can have more than one a week

216
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,960
cuz that that scared me a little. All

217
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,720
right, coming up. You ever wonder what

218
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,879
the deal is with liquid eggs? How many

219
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
of you guys buy liquid eggs in cartons?

220
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,080
All right, left. makes life easy in

221
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,380
theory. We're going to find out. Stay

222
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
with us.

223
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,120
[Applause]

224
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,360
The doctor and nurse charged with

225
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,720
murder. I found him unresponsive of

226
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,960
their own son. I forgot how to do CPR.

227
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,120
But there are more twists to this story.

228
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,160
There was some head trauma. Classic

229
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,560
shaken baby syndrome. Plus, a sociopath

230
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,160
cop who prayed on women. How did this

231
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,240
police officer get away with this for so

232
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,720
long? And the whistleblower who brought

233
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,080
him down. A lot of officers start coming

234
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,830
forward. All new Oz.

235
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,989
That's coming up

236
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,989
[Applause]

237
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,440
tomorrow. All right. No yolk

238
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,200
substitutes. They come in cartons like

239
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,680
this, right? These no yolk substitutes

240
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,920
have only increased in popularity with

241
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,080
the low carb, high protein diet trends.

242
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,480
But are they as healthy? And could they

243
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,000
be even healthier than the real thing?

244
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,360
Food journalist Ally Rosa has looked

245
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,040
into these and she's here to tell us the

246
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,279
truth. Why do people like getting their

247
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,279
egg whites from cartons? Well, it's

248
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,640
really just about convenience, right?

249
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,880
Every time you want to make an egg

250
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,399
white, you've got to go in, it's messy,

251
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,680
it's hard, you got to do the like back

252
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,680
and forth, screw it up. Exactly. And you

253
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,760
know, it's just You missed some. I know.

254
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,839
See? Exactly. That's my point. So,

255
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,600
people like egg substitutes because it's

256
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,120
easier. All right. So, the question is,

257
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,040
are they really good for you? Let's look

258
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,440
into these liquid egg substitutes.

259
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,200
Starting out with liquid eggs whites.

260
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,839
Egg whites. They come in cartons now.

261
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,360
Adriano uses them every day for

262
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,040
breakfast. She says, "What do you love

263
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
about the egg whites in the carton?"

264
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,440
Because it's so easy, the simplicity of

265
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
it. I mean, I learned I mean, I've

266
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,560
learned and I've learned from you, too,

267
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,040
about how important breakfast is. And

268
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,480
it's like it's we're all rushing, you

269
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,000
know, trying to get somewhere in the

270
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,839
morning. And, you know, that thought of

271
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,519
having to do that with the eggs, I just

272
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,959
get, you know, forget about it.

273
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,240
protein in breakfast and you want to

274
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,080
avoid the embarrassment that Ally just

275
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,480
suffered through. Oh my god, I'm even

276
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,399
worse. Forget about it. So, what did you

277
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,240
find out about egg whites in a carton?

278
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,560
So, it's really important that it says

279
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,720
100% egg whites because then there's no

280
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,160
additives. So, if you see 100% egg

281
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,839
whites, that means that that's all

282
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,279
that's in there, but you want to just

283
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959
make sure it has that. You don't want

284
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,560
any additional extras. It should be

285
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
achievable relatively easily. So, we're

286
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,360
generally in support of this. Yeah,

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
we're in support of it. You just have to

288
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,279
remember that it's more expensive. Eggs

289
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,120
are cheap and easy. And then it also you

290
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,040
have to use it within 7 days of opening.

291
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,360
So that's the only downside. Save me a

292
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,440
little bit. Yeah, I will. They're these

293
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,200
zero

294
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,560
cholesterol egg substitutes. I I don't

295
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
know much about these. I've never tried

296
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,760
these. Teresa says she likes them.

297
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
You've not let a single ed egg into your

298
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,200
house since your husband was told he has

299
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,040
a cholesterol issue. Correct. Shows your

300
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,560
love for him. Yes. Because you probably

301
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,160
could have gotten away with it. Maybe.

302
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,240
Ally, what do you know about these?

303
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,040
Well, so egg substitute is made with

304
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,320
real egg whites, but they're taking out

305
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,560
the yolk. So, when they're taking out

306
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,240
the yolks, they want to add back in a

307
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,000
lot of those vitamins and minerals that

308
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,320
come with the yolk. But the issue is

309
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,399
that they're also adding thickeners and

310
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
stabilizers and coloring to try and make

311
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,880
it look and feel like an egg. It can

312
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,800
have up to 31 extra ingredients. So, 31.

313
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,480
Yeah, 31 extra ingredients, which you

314
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,360
can see here. They're kind of all

315
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,120
scrolling by. So, uh you really, if

316
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,839
you're trying to eat clean, I would say

317
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,959
this probably isn't the best choice. and

318
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,000
just to do what's best for you and your

319
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,600
husband and those wonderful kids of

320
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,279
yours. My general thought is if you're

321
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,480
going to take something away and not eat

322
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,079
it anymore, like if you're not going to

323
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
have the yolk of the egg and just have

324
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,040
the whites, I'm okay with that. But

325
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,160
trying to pretend like you have the yolk

326
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,079
when you're not going to have the yolk,

327
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,959
it's often not worth the effort. Okay.

328
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,880
All right. Finally, there's a new vegan

329
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,800
egg substitute that Teresa, you might

330
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,360
like this even more. This supposedly

331
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,040
stands up to any of the runny yolk of an

332
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,399
egg that you may want to add to a

333
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,320
recipe. Sort of like, you know how with

334
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,560
the Impossible Burger, that burger

335
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,079
that's not with any meat but has actual

336
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,760
blood coming out of it. They made a

337
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,040
burger from vegetables. So, what are

338
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,640
these made of? How do they make powder

339
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,160
into a yolk? Yeah. I was a little

340
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,160
skeptical because it's, you know, it's

341
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,600
no egg. It's no cholesterol. It's no

342
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,560
fat. And I was kind of like, are we just

343
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,320
eating air? Like, right. What's left?

344
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Right. But, um, it's actually mostly

345
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,240
made with pea protein. And then they add

346
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,480
in nutritional yeast, which is something

347
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,639
you see a lot in vegan food, which gives

348
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,560
it that umami flavor. Um, and then

349
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,880
there's a few, you know, guar gum and

350
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,040
zantham gum, um, beta carotene for the

351
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,880
color. Um, but it's mostly okay. So, you

352
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,240
make it just by, you have a little bit

353
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,959
of water, you put in this powder, throw

354
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,519
the top on, if you will, and then you

355
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,680
just mix it up.

356
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,360
That's it. And you let that go. And what

357
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,920
comes out? And then you throw it in the

358
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
microwave. And what comes out is this

359
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,760
substitute here. So that's it there.

360
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
That's it there. So it looks like an

361
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,440
egg. And you let me know if you think it

362
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,440
tastes like an egg. There. I made you a

363
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,440
little egg sandwich here. She's a little

364
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,839
dubious of it. I'm a little dubious,

365
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,000
too. Yolk, but it but it's vegan and the

366
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,079
protein source. We know it's vegan and

367
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
you know, pea protein is good. Still

368
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,399
some of those stabilizers. So, what do

369
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,760
you think? Good. Missing a little

370
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,279
something, but it will get the job done.

371
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,760
You didn't miss your shirt. I No, I got

372
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,600
it all over me. Yeah, I actually like

373
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,200
this, guys. I think I really do. I think

374
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,480
this is a winner. If you're vegan, it's

375
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,760
a good substitute. You know, if you're

376
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,680
looking for something and you don't want

377
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,839
to have any animal protein, it's a good

378
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,120
one to try. Here, I'll toast the stains

379
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,120
for any busy mom. We'll be right back.

380
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,200
We investigate iced tea. What's really

381
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,880
brewing in those store-bought bottles?

382
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,560
No guarantee that you're getting what

383
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,760
you think you're getting. That's coming

384
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,760
up Wednesday on Dr. Oz.

385
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,000
Today we are investigating one of the

386
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,320
most popular and controversial food.

387
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,920
Everyone is buying hot dogs. You can see

388
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
how excited the audience is. When you

389
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,839
see use the word hot dogs, they all

390
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,839
light up. We consume 20 billion of them

391
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,480
each year. But there's a lot of food

392
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,399
fiction about hot dogs, especially on

393
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,240
social media. Like what kinds of meat

394
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
are actually in there and do they really

395
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,079
cause cancer? We decided to look into

396
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,760
what's real and what's not and

397
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,120
investigate the question I get asked all

398
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,680
the time. Is there an Oz approved real

399
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,560
deal hot dog? You want the answer to

400
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,320
that everybody? All

401
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,160
right, I'm going to give it to you. Here

402
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,920
to help investigate is Chef Charles

403
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Shen. So, give us a little bit of hot

404
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,680
dog history, chef. Where did this all

405
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
come from? Why did America get so

406
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,839
obsessed with hot dogs? So, hot dogs

407
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,519
have been around since the 19th century.

408
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,959
And one report says that they originated

409
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,560
from Germany. Then they were brought

410
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,920
over to New York and served in a push

411
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,959
cart. Next thing you know, they were

412
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,120
served in butcher shops and also sports

413
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,880
stadiums and people became obsessed with

414
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
hot dogs. The next thing you know, they

415
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,560
were actually served to the Queen of

416
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,000
England in 1939. Talk about

417
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,079
royalty. It's a famous incident. It's

418
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,519
really people talk about it was the most

419
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,279
American food they could give to the

420
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,880
queen. Yeah. So, I gota be honest

421
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,880
everybody, right? Even though it's a fan

422
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,880
favorite, most doctors don't like hot

423
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,959
dogs. We know there's health risks to

424
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,240
them. You had a big transformation. I

425
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,720
should say green brag on the chef. He

426
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
lost 100 pounds. 100 lbs. Here's a

427
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,399
before and after everybody. I mean for a

428
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,839
chef especially, you transformed your

429
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,199
own health. So you pay attention to

430
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,279
health issues. What worries you

431
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,519
Absolutely. about hot dogs and health.

432
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,880
So this is considered processed meat and

433
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,480
this has been linked to a bunch of

434
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,079
different health effects. So looking at

435
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,480
hot dogs, it has been linked to things

436
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,959
like high blood pressure, diabetes. One

437
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,480
study actually shows that eating one

438
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,440
daily serving of processed meat, which

439
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,199
is one hot dog, is associated with 42%

440
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,760
higher risk of developing coronary

441
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,040
disease, heart disease. Yes. So, and

442
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,800
that's not not even talking about the

443
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,959
cancer risk that I know the WHO's talked

444
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,519
about with processed meats. The question

445
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,600
is what's going down? Let's investigate

446
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,880
how hot dogs are really made. We'll

447
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,639
start off with the fear that a lot of

448
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,079
Americans have voiced to me, which is

449
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
they don't know what's actually in a hot

450
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,760
dog. What make makes a hot dog? No

451
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,079
animal looks like this. Yeah. So,

452
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,759
according to the USDA, traditional hot

453
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,399
dogs are made from one of the following

454
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,240
meats: pork, beef, and chicken. And

455
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,160
also, the packaging must state what type

456
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,519
of meat that you're actually eating. And

457
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,519
from there, they actually start with

458
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,279
trimmings are basically what the butcher

459
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,880
doesn't use as separate cuts. It could

460
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,800
be reasonable quality trimmings. Yeah.

461
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,720
And then they combine it all together.

462
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,880
And then also, if there's any byproducts

463
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,120
of kidneys, liver, or heart, they must

464
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,800
specify what types of meat and where it

465
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
came from in the animals in the

466
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,320
ingredient list. All right. Next thing

467
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,720
that that that needs to happen for that

468
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,480
transformation to occur is fillers,

469
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,680
which are things that I'm always worried

470
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,480
about because I'm not quite sure if

471
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,240
they're what I'm paying for. Yes. So, to

472
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,240
combine all this meat together, some

473
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,720
brands like to use fillers such as soy

474
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,279
proteins and also some cereal grains.

475
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,639
So, according to the USDA, hot dogs can

476
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,160
contain up to 3.5% of these fillers. But

477
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,360
this just adds to the idea that this

478
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,199
meat is super heavily processed. It is a

479
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,399
process. I as I look at it here, that

480
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,079
doesn't bother me quite as much as I

481
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,160
thought it would. What does bother me

482
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,680
though is this. The most controversial

483
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,600
of all issues around the hot dogs are

484
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,279
the nitrates. It looks so innocuous when

485
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,639
it's in this powdered form. Oh wow. But

486
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,360
it's a problem. Why are they in hot

487
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,279
dogs? So nitrites are actually chemical

488
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,680
compounds that are used as preservatives

489
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,679
in processed meat such as hot dogs and

490
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,079
they're used as preservatives for the

491
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,240
meat. Also add flavor and also adds with

492
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,400
the color. However, these nitrates and

493
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,720
nitrites can actually form

494
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,240
cancer-causing compounds in the body.

495
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,439
So, you got to be very careful. And what

496
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,679
about the I see a lot of dogs say

497
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,280
nitrate free. What are they using? How

498
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,880
do they accomplish that? Yeah. So, when

499
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,959
it says nitrate free, they're using

500
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,360
natural nitrates coming from celery, but

501
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,080
the amount of nitrates used is just as

502
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,280
much as the synthetic nitrates. So, you

503
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,440
still have to be very careful. So, even

504
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,440
if it's celery powder or celery juice,

505
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,440
it still has the same potential risk.

506
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
Yes. All right. So, because of all these

507
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
things we're talking about, there are a

508
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,320
lot of full hot dogs out there, like the

509
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,559
veggie kinds. You've heard the veggie

510
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,000
hot dogs, right? Turkey dogs and like.

511
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,120
So, this is an example what a turkey dog

512
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,720
looks like. Doesn't quite look as pretty

513
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,240
as that hot dog I showed you earlier.

514
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,960
Oh, yeah. Explain. There's a there's a

515
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,720
true veggie hot dog. These may not be

516
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,320
quite what they're cooked up to be. No.

517
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,240
So, I looked at a bunch of different hot

518
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,640
dogs on the market, Dr. Oz. And

519
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,880
specifically, I looked at uh turkey hot

520
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,200
dogs and also veggie hot dogs. Turkey

521
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,280
hot dogs actually contain mechanically

522
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,720
separated turkey, which means we have no

523
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,720
idea what kind of body parts they're

524
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,880
using in the hot dog. And then looking

525
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,799
at the veggie hot dogs, we actually

526
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,360
found they use seven times amount of

527
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,679
ingredients than regular hot dogs. So

528
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,600
say seven times seven times the amount

529
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,080
of regular ingredients. They found

530
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,160
things like sugar and also hydrogelized

531
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,400
proteins, which I don't know if it's

532
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,720
much healthier. So, I have searched far

533
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,200
and wide for a good hot dog replacement.

534
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,679
Even trying to make carrots into hot

535
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,640
dogs. Take a look at this effort. This

536
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,880
is the hot dog of my dreams. And this is

537
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,520
no ordinary hot dog. Prepare for your

538
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,840
mind to be blown by this hack. Who wants

539
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,919
one? Hot dogs. Hot dogs. Anybody? Hot

540
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,240
dogs. Hot dogs. Who wants a little hot

541
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:55,679
dog? Hot dog. Guess what? This in here.

542
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,440
Look carefully. It's actually a carrot.

543
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,160
Yeah, it didn't go over so well. I get

544
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,720
it. Nothing like the real deal. So, the

545
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,720
moment of truth. Can there really be a

546
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,799
healthy hot dog? Remember, hot dogs are

547
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,760
not a daily food. So, don't take us out

548
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,600
of context, but if you're going to

549
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,000
indulge once in a while, at least choose

550
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,840
wisely. So, Aaron from my med unit is

551
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,520
coming out. Come on, Aaron. You're going

552
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,280
to wheel out the winning hot

553
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:24,720
dog. I present to you

554
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:29,200
the best hot dog. Aaron, come join us.

555
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:33,440
Are you ready? And the winner is tada.

556
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,280
It's a 100% beef hot dog.

557
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,120
Now, what does that mean? The first

558
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,760
ingredient needs to be beef. It's say

559
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,280
100% organic or grass-fed beef. Avoid

560
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,559
the mechanically separated stuff that

561
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,760
we're just talking about with chef,

562
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,760
right? You don't you want to know what

563
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,080
the meat came from. The next ingredients

564
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,240
got to be water. So, it's meat. 100%

565
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,840
water. That's okay. And the ingredient

566
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,919
label should avoid common fillers like

567
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,360
the soy protein and cereal grains. we

568
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,440
talked about earlier and one last little

569
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,880
hack that Aeron's sharing with us. You

570
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,559
don't want more than 500 milligrams of

571
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,679
sodium. Why cause more problems for

572
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,919
yourself? So, where do you find these

573
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,440
hot dogs? So, we did a lot of research

574
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,880
on this and you can actually find them

575
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
in a lot of your local grocery stores

576
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,919
and even online. You can search for

577
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,600
them. So, it's they're pretty easy to

578
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,840
get. And chef, you got a special topping

579
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,840
for this better than usual hot dog. Yes,

580
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,840
absolutely. So, instead of using regular

581
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,440
ketchup, which has a lot of sugar, I

582
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,679
would use something like homemade salsa

583
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,679
or pico de gallo. Adds a nice tartness,

584
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,400
nice texture, and it's a win-win for

585
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,720
everyone. And there's no sugar. No. So,

586
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,640
we're going to call them salsa dogs. Who

587
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,559
wants a salsa dog? Salsa dog. Anybody?

588
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,760
My car didn't go over well. Salsa dog.

589
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,960
Salsa dog. Give one a shot. Give one a

590
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,840
shot. I want Go ahead. Give it a bite.

591
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,400
Give it a taste. The real Dr. Orzac, you

592
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,280
know. Hot dog. Hot dogs and beer. Dr.

593
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Oz. Proof that God loves us.

594
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,080
I love you, too, guys. Enjoy it. That's

595
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,710
more here. Charles, thank you very much.

596
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,720
We'll be right

597
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:58,159
[Applause]

598
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,240
back. We all wish we could go back in

599
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,080
time and undo the health wrongs that we

600
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,760
made over the years. And today we are

601
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,760
telling you how with four easy

602
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:14,320
[Music]

603
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,080
steps. It's your favorite thing to

604
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,400
click, right? You go up there, you hit

605
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,720
the undo button. And as you hit it, oh,

606
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,640
feels so good. But is there an undo

607
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,600
button for your health? Can you go back

608
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,440
to a healthier version of you? Well,

609
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,360
there is an undue button to reverse

610
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
disease in our bodies. And thanks to my

611
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,000
next guest, we actually have proof. Dean

612
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,080
Ornish is a maverick. He's a visionary

613
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,480
who bravely challenged the status quo of

614
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,080
how medicine treats disease. Dean has

615
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,000
been a driving force and an inspiration

616
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,400
to me personally and many others since

617
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,480
my early days in medical school. Now, he

618
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,480
and his wife Anne, a health and stress

619
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,840
expert, have teamed up to take home all

620
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,919
this research that all the proven work

621
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,080
they've done and turned into an easy to

622
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,840
follow four-step plan to stop diseases

623
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,520
like heart disease and diabetes and

624
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,840
dementia right in their tracks. Please

625
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,920
welcome my friends Dr. Dean Orish and

626
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,890
Anne Ornish.

627
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,260
[Applause]

628
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,180
[Music]

629
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:11,369
[Applause]

630
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,369
[Music]

631
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,000
and how are you?

632
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,679
It's so much fun to have you here. I got

633
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,120
to say before we get into the show, you

634
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,760
are really one of my heroes and I

635
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,919
remember vividly I was uh right the

636
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,600
beginning of residency and I went to

637
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,280
this big American Heart Association

638
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,559
meeting and this is a meeting where all

639
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,840
the best new ideas are planned out and

640
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,679
there was this room in the corner there

641
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,600
just packed you couldn't get into it and

642
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,520
I was crawling over people trying to get

643
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,360
inside because I knew you were speaking

644
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,760
and it was one of the first talks that

645
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,280
you gave that really threatened I say

646
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,799
that word on purpose because you were

647
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,640
challenging orthodoxy but threatening

648
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,559
the belief that so many in American

649
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,159
medicine had that when you had an

650
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,000
illness, it was yours. We could use

651
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,039
medications to slow it down, but you

652
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,120
sort of were going to live with that

653
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,280
problem for the rest of your life. What

654
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,120
gave you the courage, the confidence to

655
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,799
challenge the the American medical

656
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,640
establishment to argue that no,

657
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,400
lifestyles can actually reverse some of

658
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,559
these problems? Oh, well, thank you for

659
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,000
your kind words. I appreciate it. Um,

660
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,360
when I was in medical school, I did my

661
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,799
core surgery rotation with Michael

662
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,400
Debakei, the eminent heart surgeon who

663
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,240
helped develop bypass surgery. And as a

664
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,440
heart surgeon, you know, and I'm sure

665
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,919
you've had the experience of, you know,

666
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,200
you cut people open, you they they go

667
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,400
home, they do all the things that cause

668
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
the problem in the first place, you

669
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,840
know, eat junk food and smoke cigarettes

670
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,440
and not manage stress and their new

671
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,960
arteries clog up and you cut them open

672
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,559
again. I said, you know, there has to be

673
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,320
a better way. And bypass surgery became

674
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,600
we were literally bypassing the problem.

675
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,600
So I wondered what would happen if we

676
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,960
treated the cause. And so I went to the

677
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,159
li these things called libraries and

678
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,919
these things called journals, you know,

679
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,520
which no one use anymore. And I found in

680
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,720
dogs and cats and pigs and rabbits and

681
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,000
monkeys, you could cause them to get

682
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,240
heart disease if you put them under

683
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,440
these, you know, bad diets and so on.

684
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,799
And you could reverse it if you change

685
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,799
that. So why should people be any

686
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,240
different? So Annie, you argue that it's

687
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,799
not just about food. There's more than

688
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,520
that. Absolutely not. What makes this so

689
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,720
powerful is that it's a comprehensive

690
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,960
way of living. So what you eat, how you

691
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,640
respond to stress, how much activity you

692
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,039
have, and really how much love and

693
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,840
support you have are the simple choices

694
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:09,440
that we make every day that can either

695
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,400
create um health and well-being or uh

696
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,320
disease and suffering. So it's your

697
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,840
choice. Each each one of us makes that

698
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,039
choice every day, many times. Well,

699
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
we're going to make it easy to make the

700
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,760
right choice today. Let me put you on

701
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,000
the spot for a second. You debated the

702
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,679
famous Dr. Atkins years ago. Many times,

703
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,240
actually. Many many times. I remember

704
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,320
vividly one time and now we're seeing a

705
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,120
full circle come around again with paleo

706
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,679
and keto diet advocates arguing the same

707
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,679
things that Dr. Atkins argued. Yes. Why

708
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,440
why do you think those diets are not as

709
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,120
good as the Ornish diet and give us a

710
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,960
little bit of insight into why the

711
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,559
Ornish diet has probably been the best

712
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240
studied of all of the diets for reversal

713
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,679
of disease? Well, because it's the only

714
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,200
diet, our diet is the only one that's

715
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,799
actually been proven to reverse disease.

716
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,159
It's why US News and World Report is

717
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,600
rated at number one for heart health

718
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,360
almost every one of the last eight years

719
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
since they've been rating diets. The

720
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,120
studies have shown that on a diet like I

721
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,279
recommend your arteries are clean. On a

722
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,440
standard American diet or has an actual

723
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,760
acronym of SAD diet, they're partially

724
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,360
clogged. And on an Atkins or Paleo or

725
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,880
keto diet, they're part they're severely

726
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,720
clogged. And it's one of the reasons why

727
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,480
when Dr. Atkins died, they published his

728
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,480
autopsy report and he had he died of

729
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,919
massive heart failure. And so the

730
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,279
problem is you can lose weight on those

731
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,120
diets, but you mortgage your health in

732
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,960
the process. Whereas on the diet, we

733
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,559
recommend you can lose even more weight,

734
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,400
but you enhance your health rather than

735
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,080
harming it. So, our partners at

736
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,520
ShareCare have worked to put Dean's plan

737
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,440
into practice for millions of you,

738
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,520
offering a comprehensive solution that

739
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,120
is so effective. Listen carefully. Even

740
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,640
Medicare covers it. I mean, insurance

741
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,840
companies cover because Medicare covers

742
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,440
it as well. That's right. Most insurance

743
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,960
companies are because you it took 16

744
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,320
years for Medicare to do that. But I

745
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,320
wanted to be available to everyone and

746
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,480
now it is. So, Dean's book puts a lot of

747
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,080
these insights, books called Undo It

748
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,720
into easy practice. So let me explain to

749
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,039
everybody why Dean Orish's fundamental

750
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,880
findings about undoing disease are so

751
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,400
important. So you all know these

752
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,240
diseases right? Asthma, heart disease,

753
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,640
diabetes, prostate cancer, you know,

754
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,640
ulcers, reflex, all this stuff. What

755
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,080
Dean sees is not a lot of different

756
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,120
diseases that look separate from each

757
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,159
other. He sees the same disease, just

758
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,159
one masquerading in different forms.

759
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,559
They all share the same underlying

760
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,480
biological mechanisms of inflammation,

761
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,679
oxidative stress, changes in your gut,

762
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,080
your microbiome. We've talked about

763
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,720
these things. So each one of these

764
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,720
things, right, is directly affected by

765
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,799
how we live. That's the one circular

766
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,400
path we have to go get into. And what we

767
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,559
eat and how much we exercise, it all

768
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,799
affects this, right? So what you eat

769
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,679
matters, right? How you exercise

770
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,279
matters. And perhaps most importantly,

771
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,520
how much love and support you have in

772
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,120
your lives. They all come together. And

773
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,240
we can change these variables. And if we

774
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,080
do that, we can actually reverse

775
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,840
disease. And there are four steps to the

776
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,159
undue plan that you can start off today.

777
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,960
The first step is to add low-fat

778
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,480
plant-based foods to your diet. Why are

779
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
plant-based foods the cornerstone of

780
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,400
your program of the Ornish diet? Well,

781
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,919
in simple terms, they're high in the the

782
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,679
substances that keep us healthy, that

783
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,120
have anti-cancer, anti-aging, anti-he

784
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,400
heart disease properties, and they're

785
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,880
low in the ones that keep us that cause

786
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,320
us to get sick. Keeps it simple. Really

787
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,400
simple. And wanted to make the plant

788
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,840
easy to follow. So they found prepared

789
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,520
foods in grocery stores. You don't have

790
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,440
to go into the kitchen and spend six

791
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,240
hours making the food. Walk us through a

792
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:16,159
couple of the examples. Well, so here is

793
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,880
some um tacos and um a lot of I I grew

794
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,880
up eating meats and loving meats. So if

795
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,799
this wasn't savory, it wouldn't be

796
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,320
sustainable. So there are so many

797
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,640
wonderful options. It's never been

798
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,279
easier to eat this way and be fully

799
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,760
satisfied. So, some of the the crumbles

800
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,200
that we like to use in pasta sauces, in

801
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,960
this case, tacos, these are a delicious

802
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,559
crowd-pleaser. And it's so easy to get

803
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,799
uh complete protein, enough protein.

804
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,480
That's a myth. So, these are just a

805
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,679
couple of examples of just be specific.

806
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,679
This is called textured vegetable

807
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,360
protein or TBP. That's what you'll see

808
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,640
it call that. Yes, we made tacos with

809
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,279
it, but as I mentioned, you can make

810
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,399
lots of other meals. It's a ground beef

811
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,520
replacement. Try it before you judge,

812
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,120
guys. I know you're out there saying,

813
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,600
"No, there's no way, right?" But

814
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,520
soybased proteins do work and and these

815
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,640
little, you know, bacon things are soy.

816
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,080
All right, let's take a look at what

817
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,399
this meal plan looks like in real

818
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,440
practice. Who else to call in here but

819
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,200
Renatha? Go to

820
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,720
testure. Renatha tells it like it is. I

821
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,080
just showed a couple examples. There are

822
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,919
simple hacks you can buy in the grocery

823
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,760
store, but these are actual meals we

824
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,000
made. And this is a go-to lunch option.

825
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,600
It's a lentil, chili, and greens. There

826
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,520
we are making. There's a lasagna to get

827
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,760
to in a second. Why is this your power

828
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,640
choice? Okay, so this was my favorite

829
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,559
because this actually mimics actual

830
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,440
ground beef. Yeah, I said it. Ground

831
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,600
beef. Okay, it's nice and thick. The

832
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,919
lentils actually replace the ground beef

833
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,520
option. And this is a winner for me. All

834
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,559
right, let's go over to this lasagna,

835
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,799
which I know you're waiting for. The

836
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,480
spinach lasagna, everyone's favorite.

837
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,320
This is a whole wheat lasagna. Noodles

838
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,880
though, right, are straight up whole

839
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,240
grain. And the tofu, right, is using

840
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,279
with nutritional yeast instead of

841
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,279
ricotta. So it this this is not ricotta,

842
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,200
right? And you guys cook with this

843
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,120
usually. Oh, yeah. It's delicious. Now,

844
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,720
I know you're not a big tofu fan, but

845
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,320
tofu takes on the flavor of whatever you

846
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,240
put into it. So, we're not you've

847
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,080
rotested many a dish for us. Your

848
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,640
thoughts on the spinach lasagna. Okay.

849
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,679
So, you know, so before I made it, I was

850
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,919
like, you want me to eat tofu, Dr.

851
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,159
Yes, that's exactly what she said. But

852
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,840
this has the pasta in it. It has the

853
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:23,120
tofu. The tofu and the the the yeast. It

854
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,159
takes on the taste of cheese and you

855
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,120
know we love our cheese. This is really

856
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,480
really fabulous. Yes. Yes. It's full.

857
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,080
It's thoughtful. It actually You

858
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,039
wouldn't know it wasn't ricotta cheese.

859
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,880
Absolutely. That's the point. Dr. Oz, a

860
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,240
toast to the ornishes on there. We're

861
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,919
going to put these recipes plus an

862
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,559
amazing blueberry banana smoothie which

863
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,840
I did not let you have yet on dr.com.

864
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,760
You're going to try it. There it is. It

865
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,039
looks so good. It could have been yours.

866
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,039
All right. When we come back, it takes

867
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,799
less than 30 minutes, but it could keep

868
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,600
you out of a doctor's office like mine

869
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,600
for the rest of your life. Stick around.

870
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,960
Fabulous. I love getting to talk with

871
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,880
you on my show every single day, but

872
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,360
when the cameras stop rolling, the

873
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,039
conversation is not over. I still have a

874
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,440
lot that I want to talk about. So

875
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,360
download the Dr. Oz podcast on Apple

876
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,840
Podcast or wherever you get your

877
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,200
podcast.

878
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:19,360
[Applause]

879
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,200
We're back with a brand new four-step

880
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,039
plan to undo the diseases that you dread

881
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,039
the most. Dr. Dean Orish and his wife

882
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,039
Anne have seen the effects change the

883
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,360
lives of their patients firsthand. And

884
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,799
now they're sharing it with you. We've

885
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,320
got food. We talked about that a little

886
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,000
bit. Let's take a look at what else we

887
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,440
need to deal with, including stress,

888
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,240
because the next step of the plan is how

889
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,840
to use mindful methods to reduce stress.

890
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,480
We pay a lot of lip service to this

891
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,399
concept of stress, but you've used

892
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,760
tactics to address it in these plans

893
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,080
that you and Shareare have all over the

894
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,679
country with unbelievable results. Yeah.

895
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,039
Well, stress, as you know, can activate

896
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,559
all the mechanisms you talked about

897
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,320
earlier that that really underly all

898
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,919
these chronic diseases. But the good

899
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,760
news is that the stress comes not just

900
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,600
from what you do. More important is how

901
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,039
you react to what you do. And the kinds

902
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,399
of things that Anne can talk about are

903
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,559
ways that we found you can be in the

904
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,320
same job, the same family, and react in

905
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,000
different ways and accomplish even more

906
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,360
without getting stressed and sick in the

907
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,960
process. And give us some hacks. Well,

908
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,279
you say a lot of us do it wrong. We have

909
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,039
this very intent desire to meditate, but

910
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,679
we can't do it. Well, I think that we're

911
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,760
if we're waiting for a meditation

912
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,760
retreat, that perfect moment where the

913
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,520
waters have been parted, that's probably

914
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,080
not going to happen. So, we have to take

915
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,480
advantage of the time that we do have.

916
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,799
And by just taking a moment to refocus

917
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,159
our attention, we can take the same

918
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,799
stressful moment like road rage, but uh

919
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,880
reorient ourselves by reorienting our

920
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,559
attention. Crazy as it sounds,

921
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,720
everybody, your new meditation space is

922
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,240
going to be your car. Think about it.

923
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,480
You're in there anyway, right? You're

924
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,760
driving America's commute a lot or going

925
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,519
shopping, whatever you're doing. Just

926
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,000
while you're in the car, keep your keep

927
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,440
your eyes open. Eyes open. The Dean's

928
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,960
always warning people to do that. But

929
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,039
you can actually get into a calm space

930
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,559
and use that positive energy to reshape

931
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,600
your life. When you talk about the

932
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,799
effect of stress, it's like you're

933
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,000
talking about the effect of food. That's

934
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,120
right. All those risk factors you

935
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,480
mentioned, remember there's one cause of

936
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,000
it all. That's right. It makes it a lot

937
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,440
easier to keep up with life. Okay. The

938
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,440
next step in the plan that you have to

939
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,200
use to undo disease is to fill your day

940
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,039
with short bursts of energy using

941
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,919
resistance. Now, Renata, who's not been

942
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,919
a big advocate of

943
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:20,480
exercise, right, has designed her own

944
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,000
resistance training mode, right? And you

945
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,760
wait now you've got a band there which

946
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,120
cost less than a dollar I think last

947
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,240
time I priced it out. So you want to do

948
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,799
a biceps curl. What are you going to do

949
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,279
for us? So I'm going to demo for you a

950
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,600
bicep curl sitting down no less. How

951
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,640
about that? Okay. So all you have to do

952
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,000
you get one of these little resistance

953
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,080
band. Like you said they only cost a

954
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,760
dollar. A buck in the store. Put it

955
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,080
around your foot right there. Okay. Get

956
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,399
that planted. And all you have to do is

957
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,600
sit here. And one. And two. Look at

958
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:52,799
these guns. Look at these guns. Yes.

959
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,200
Listen, the key is you can be sitting at

960
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,880
work tasks that you normally can't get a

961
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,720
lot of exercise on. No one's going to

962
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,159
know you're doing this. You can do pulls

963
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,080
be under the desk. Your legs can be

964
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,519
going like this under the desk. But you

965
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,200
need to get a little activity. You need

966
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,519
to get a little breathy for about half

967
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,600
an hour. And if you do that, it changes

968
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,440
a lot. Changes everything, you know, and

969
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,360
it's so simple. And you know, you can do

970
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,039
it anywhere as you say. All right. So,

971
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,000
there's a surprising effect that this

972
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,519
exercise is going to have that you're

973
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,360
going to enjoy. It's going to affect

974
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,799
your brain. Absolutely. And Dean, your

975
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,240
studies looking at, you know, again, I'm

976
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,000
so impressed that you've demonstrated

977
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,360
you can reverse heart disease and

978
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,039
actually early stage prostate cancer.

979
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,960
These are very seemingly very different

980
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,720
diseases with one common mechanism, but

981
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,480
the Alzheimer's story is the most comp

982
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,320
compelling to me. Well, Alzheimer's

983
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,600
shares the same underlying mechanisms as

984
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,039
all these other conditions. And I think

985
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,559
we're at a place with Alzheimer's that

986
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,760
we were 50 years, 40 years ago with

987
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,440
heart disease when we started doing

988
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,799
work. So, we're now doing the first

989
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,480
randomized trial to see if we can

990
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,640
reverse Alzheimer's disease. So, stay

991
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,960
tuned. We're uh we're hopeful. be part

992
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,480
of it, not listen. The final step is

993
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,080
pretty simple, is to find a way of of

994
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,200
loving and supporting people in your

995
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,559
life and making sure they do the same

996
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,240
with you. That's how you connect with

997
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,159
people around you. That's how I feel

998
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,159
about both you guys and thanks for being

999
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,320
lifelong friends. God bless you both.

1000
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,399
You can check out their new book. It's

1001
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,679
called Undo It. There's a picture of it.

1002
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,440
It's available now. The thing is the

1003
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,200
audience, I mean, they want to reverse

1004
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,760
heart disease and prevent Alzheimer's

1005
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,240
and deal with anything else that they're

1006
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,520
meant. Can they have a copy? I think you

1007
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,679
should give every everyone a You guys

1008
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,240
want a copy of the book? You're all

1009
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,720
going over the copy of Dean's book.

1010
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,720
We'll be right

1011
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,679
back. Up next, an investigation into

1012
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,520
cough drops. Do they really work? We

1013
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,919
reveal the results of our first ever

1014
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,919
cough

1015
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,889
[Applause]

1016
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,879
experiment. The day of investigation you

1017
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,399
don't want to miss this time of year,

1018
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,399
especially if you're doing

1019
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,320
this. Yeah, you know who you are.

1020
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,320
Coughing away and you're desperate for

1021
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,000
any type of relief right this second.

1022
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,640
So, we're uncovering the truth about

1023
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,640
cough drops. Do they really work? And

1024
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,160
can you really get addicted to them?

1025
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,160
Here to help me figure it out is my

1026
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,079
go-to tester, Rena. How are you? Hello.

1027
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,480
So, you may not know it, but Renatha,

1028
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,000
she loves to sing backstage. I hear it

1029
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,839
all the time. Yeah, you argue cough drop

1030
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,440
chops are your go-to remedy when you

1031
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,280
have a scratchy throat. They are my

1032
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,119
go-to remedy. You know what? I'm so glad

1033
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,680
you're doing this because sometimes when

1034
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,520
I'm really horse, I there's about 20

1035
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,440
pieces of cough chops in one bag. I'll

1036
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,119
eat the whole bag in one day. The whole

1037
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,960
bag? Yes, the whole bag. How many

1038
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,040
baggers are there here people? We have a

1039
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,640
couple baggers here. Yeah, there's more

1040
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,240
than a couple. That's not That's not

1041
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,200
uncommon. Yeah, we'll talk about that as

1042
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,960
well. Come on over here. We've been

1043
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,480
bringing internist Dr. Sandra Galbard.

1044
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,079
She's been treating a lot of coals this

1045
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,280
season. is going to help us uncover the

1046
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,000
truth about cough drops. Let's start

1047
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,960
with what's really in cough drops. Cough

1048
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,960
drops, hard candies, compare them. So,

1049
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,520
cough drops, just like hard candies,

1050
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,960
often contain sugar, corn syrup,

1051
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,400
artificial sweeteners, and

1052
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,160
preservatives. So, let me tell you

1053
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,480
something. You have three of these cough

1054
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,400
drops. Just three, right? That's four

1055
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,560
grams of sugar in each one of these

1056
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,560
drops. That's the same number of sugar

1057
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,839
as a donut. Shut up. Donut. A donut.

1058
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,280
Think about that. Three. Three cough

1059
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,560
drops. You're basically having a donut.

1060
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,640
Keep that in the back of your mind. And

1061
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,920
I get the whole bag in one day. Yeah. I

1062
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,640
just did the math on me. That's seven

1063
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:23,280
donuts. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Dang, Ranatha.

1064
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,560
Dang. At least have coffee with it.

1065
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,440
Okay. All right. So, move on down here.

1066
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,800
So, we understand that these are

1067
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,480
actually more similar than we'd like to

1068
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,320
admit. The other ingredient that we see

1069
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,400
in a lot of cough drops is menthol. What

1070
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,520
is in menthol, by the way? Menthol is

1071
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,599
made from mint oil and peppermint. And

1072
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,440
um it has a really soothing effect on

1073
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,359
the throat because it numbs the throat

1074
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,880
and it has a cooling adds a cooling

1075
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,200
sensation. If that's the case, then why

1076
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,800
do I see patients friends come back and

1077
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,320
sometimes say that it actually makes it

1078
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,480
a little bit worse? So there was

1079
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,440
actually a recent study that showed that

1080
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,119
too high of a dose of menthol can worsen

1081
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,440
your cough by causing an increase in

1082
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,400
mucus buildup and irritating the throat.

1083
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,560
Like a bag worth might.

1084
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,000
All right. So, we decided to do a little

1085
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,079
experiment using some of the most

1086
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,440
popular cop drops, their brains, and the

1087
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,880
hard candies. We're going to compare

1088
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,800
them. Are you ready for this? All right,

1089
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,000
it's a big deal. We got participants and

1090
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,320
we broke them into four different

1091
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,480
groups. Here are the groups. Okay, group

1092
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,560
number one, and find yourself here, the

1093
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,560
peppermint lovers, right? Peppermint

1094
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,240
candy. Now, this is a control group,

1095
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,040
which means it doesn't actually have a

1096
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,800
specific role in stopping a cough. But

1097
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,960
and the question is, does sucking on

1098
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,880
anything, just a piece of hard candy

1099
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,440
actually reduce cough symptoms? That's

1100
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,359
group number one. Group number two,

1101
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,359
menthol people like we just talked about

1102
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,359
with reda, right? The active ingredient

1103
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,839
here provides that cooling sensation

1104
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,359
that so many of us enjoy. Then there are

1105
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,119
the people who like pectin. These are

1106
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,640
the most popular brands. you can find

1107
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,000
out, you know, which in which brand if

1108
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,680
you want to look into it. But I see a

1109
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,040
lot of people doing pectin solutions.

1110
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,440
You know why? Because it coats your

1111
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,280
throat, which again seems to be

1112
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,880
effective, at least many would argue,

1113
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,560
but we're going to put it to the test.

1114
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,040
And then the fourth group, well, they

1115
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,960
got a a product that had zinc in it. And

1116
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,880
zinc has been shown to shorten the

1117
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,839
duration of your cold, but does it

1118
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,599
really help with the cough itself? So,

1119
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,599
we have participants follow the package

1120
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,440
instructions, right? to took one cough

1121
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,240
drop, one of these four cough drops

1122
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,240
every two hours and then 15 minutes

1123
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,440
after taking a cough drop or the candy

1124
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,960
because there's a control group with the

1125
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,720
peppermint down there, right? They had

1126
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,560
to give us a little rating. Did it work

1127
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,160
for them or not? Verata, before we

1128
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,760
revealed the results of the group, which

1129
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,960
one of these were you randomized to and

1130
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,760
how did it work for you? I was

1131
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,839
randomized to the zinc. And the zinc

1132
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,839
didn't do nothing for me, doctor. It

1133
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,160
didn't. It didn't do anything for me. I

1134
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,680
No, none whatsoever. We'll come back to

1135
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,440
that because that's the one thing that

1136
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,960
seems to work to shorten the duration of

1137
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,400
the cold, but you're saying it didn't

1138
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,320
actually help the cough, right? Okay,

1139
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,320
ready for the results, everybody?

1140
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,280
Excited. All right, the answer is right

1141
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,760
up here. Three of the four groups had a

1142
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,359
majority of people who felt a small

1143
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,839
improvement. And you know what?

1144
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,160
Interestingly, the zinc like you most

1145
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,760
folks didn't see any change. That g how

1146
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,599
is that? So the one the one thing with

1147
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,280
all the data about reducing duration of

1148
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,119
the cough didn't seem to actually affect

1149
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,720
the cough. Right. Right. So zinc's been

1150
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,040
proven to reduce the duration of the

1151
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,119
common cold, but not necessarily the

1152
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,240
severity of the symptoms. All right. So

1153
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,680
that that in mind, I might actually want

1154
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,200
to take zinc plus something else.

1155
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,640
Correct. Theoretically. Yeah. So what do

1156
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,119
you look for when you're buying a cough

1157
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,960
drop? So I always tell my patients to

1158
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,440
try and find a cough drop that's low in

1159
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,160
sugar, corn syrup, artificial

1160
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,520
sweeteners. So keep track of this stuff.

1161
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,359
Don't go for the head fake. Get stuff

1162
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,400
that's relatively pure. But if you

1163
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,079
really want to take it to the next

1164
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,680
level, you probably want some at home

1165
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,520
solutions. So, up next, we're going to

1166
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,800
give you those at home solutions that'll

1167
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,220
get you through the cold season. Stick

1168
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,330
around.

1169
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:45,680
[Music]

1170
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:48,480
[Applause]

1171
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,119
The doctor and nurse charged with murder

1172
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,480
of their own son. I forgot how to do

1173
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,480
CPR. All new Oz. That's coming up

1174
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,440
tomorrow.

1175
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,280
[Music]

1176
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,960
[Applause]

1177
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,720
We've been investigating the truth about

1178
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,800
cough drops and now I'm revealing the

1179
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,800
atome cold relief solutions that really

1180
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,800
work. My go-to tester is back to try

1181
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,920
them out. Thank goodness I don't have

1182
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,160
to. The first at home solution, it's

1183
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,440
pineapple tea to relieve your sore

1184
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,119
throat. Now, you all know I love tea

1185
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,040
with honey, right? Honey is the oldest

1186
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,040
medicine around there, but pineapple,

1187
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,160
they might help your cold as well. You

1188
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,200
think you might be able to put pineapple

1189
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,520
and tea? Look at this. The pineapple has

1190
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,280
bromelene in it. Bromelene, of course,

1191
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,880
anti-inflammatory, pain reducing

1192
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,119
properties. It also breaks down the

1193
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,920
mucus. And adding it to your tea is a

1194
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,680
great way to soothe your throat. Mhm. Do

1195
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,359
you feel your throat coming alive?

1196
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,280
Listen, I feel my health coming on.

1197
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:47,280
Okay, let me

1198
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,280
see.

1199
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:56,920
Amazing.

1200
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,920
Great. How sweet.

1201
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:04,079
[Applause]

1202
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:08,240
Oh, I will toast you and your amazing

1203
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,880
grace. Indeed. Thank you so much. All

1204
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,200
right. Now, if you're stuffed up, one of

1205
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,920
my favorite go-to solutions is what?

1206
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,000
Natty. Natty pond. Netty pot. Ni pot.

1207
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,270
Why did you say it like that? Take a

1208
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,760
look at my experience with it.

1209
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:24,400
[Music]

1210
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,079
What do you guys think? Should we do it?

1211
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,319
Goes through your situses. It flushes

1212
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,599
them out. And it's right. Don't move

1213
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,240
till it comes out. And you got to hit

1214
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,920
the You got to hit the ball. Oh, you got

1215
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,760
it. You got it. Whoa.

1216
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,280
Oh, that feels good. Is Rebecca doing it

1217
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,640
or not? I can't tell. Engage your

1218
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,480
nostril. Engage your nostril with the

1219
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,920
tip of this thing. All right. You see it

1220
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,920
coming out? Look what came out of her

1221
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,880
nose. See the stuff floating around in

1222
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,760
there? I know it looks crazy, but it

1223
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,440
really works.

1224
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,400
Oh, I like this. Oh, don't lie. I like

1225
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,240
it. It feels good.

1226
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,480
So, the old fashioned pot. One of the

1227
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,319
oldest solutions known to man. Actually

1228
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,400
2,000 years old probably medicine

1229
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,920
experts are using this. But I've seen

1230
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,280
lines. That's why it's important right

1231
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,720
kind of water. Use the netti. A woman

1232
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,119
used water in her ny pot just all

1233
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,040
regular tap which of course sometimes

1234
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,839
can cause problem cause a deadly brain

1235
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,240
infection and while doctor it's very

1236
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:28,480
rare you got to distill the

1237
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,839
water or purify it or boil the thing for

1238
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,280
3 to five minutes you just got to really

1239
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,119
get it clean you got to put it up near

1240
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,880
your brain the top of your nose touches
