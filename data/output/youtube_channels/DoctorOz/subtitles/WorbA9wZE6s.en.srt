00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,519
Where do we go when we die? We're

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,840
unraveling this medical mystery and

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,440
examining the last moments of life.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,119
>> And I remember feeling so at peace and

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,359
so free of all the burdens in life.

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,640
>> Plus, the ladies of the real ask your

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,000
burning health questions.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
>> Got one that I'm almost too embarrassed

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,310
to ask.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,890
>> Coming up next.

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,260
[Applause]

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,960
Y'all ready for season 10?

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,960
>> Yeah.

[Music]

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,559
>> All of a sudden, I heard a voice.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,039
>> When I opened my eyes, I was no longer

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,600
on Earth. In just a moment, I was

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,879
somewhere else.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,600
>> Today, we unravel a medical mystery.

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,760
What do we really know about where we go

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,680
when we die? We're about to take an

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,400
eyeopening look into the moment when

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,040
your body takes its last breath and what

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,680
comes next. Dr. Jeffrey Long, who has

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,840
studied over 4,000 cases of people who

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,400
had near-death experiences, joins us

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,400
with the latest research in the death.

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,040
Pastor Corey Hendrick will show us where

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,799
faith and science intersect in death.

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,360
Plus, we hear from two women who say

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,840
they passed over and managed to return.

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,759
What they saw might bring you hope.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Let's start with the latest science of

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,240
death. Dr. Long, thanks for being here.

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,720
Pleasure.

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,960
>> There's a a lot of new information about

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,799
what happens to our body when we die.

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,759
Please share that with us. Sure.

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,079
>> We always thought that dying was like an

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,520
on and off button. you go from being

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,439
alive to permanently dead. But in recent

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,159
years, scientists are finding new

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,880
evidence that says that when we die, our

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,439
brain cells may take hours and possibly

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,320
even longer to become irreversibly

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,119
damaged leading to death. We now think

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,920
of death as a process occurring over

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,920
time and not a sudden abrupt end of

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
everything. What are the similarities

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,239
that you're identifying? What people see

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,040
and where they go in these near-death

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
experiences?

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,879
>> Well, while no two near-death

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,560
experiences are the same, there are some

58
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
characteristic features that are

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,319
commonly observed. In my studies, I

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,560
found that 45% had an outof body

61
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,440
experience. 64% met a mystical light and

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,280
74% had a level of consciousness and

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,800
alertness during their experience even

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,040
greater than they had during their

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,200
earthly everyday life. Other

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,599
characteristics include intense

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,760
generally positive emotions. They may

68
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,480
review their prior life experiences.

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,720
They may meet deceased loved ones and

70
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,200
they may even be involved in a decision

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,200
about a return to their earthly life. I

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,800
love when scientists can bridge this gap

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,959
into the unknown because we don't know,

74
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,480
right? You can't possibly know for sure.

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,480
So, let's explore where faith and

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,400
science intersect with death. Just like

77
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,159
a doctor, a faith leader is one of the

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,360
last people that a person will see

79
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,000
before they die. Pastor Corey Hendrick

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,519
is not only seen patients by the bedside

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080
and by their in their homes, but he's

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,319
also worked in a funeral home as well.

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,120
So, you just heard a science leader talk

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,640
about where doctors might think your

85
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,080
body goes when you die. Of course,

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,599
>> as a faith leader, where do you think we

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
go? What happens to our spirit?

88
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,200
>> Well, first of all, Dr. Oz, we have to

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
understand that we are tripartite

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,120
beings, which means we're made up of

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,400
body, spirit, and soul. Uh our body, if

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,959
you will, is the physical aspect of our

93
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,120
being, whereas our spirit is the

94
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,400
non-physical aspect of our being, and

95
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,640
the spirit actually leaves the body. And

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,440
so we believe that you don't die and go

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,560
directly to heaven, but there is

98
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,280
somewhat of a waiting area. Some would

99
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,519
call several types of waiting area

100
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,640
purgatory, but we refer to it as

101
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,959
paradise or Abraham's bosom. And uh our

102
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,560
faith teaches us that and that's what we

103
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,480
tend to lead to believe and what gives

104
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,799
us courage and faith every single day.

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,040
>> Let me show what happens next. And then

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,440
you say the next stage is about heaven,

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
>> correct?

108
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,720
>> Right. So help us understand what that

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,160
might look like. Give us a an idea of of

110
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,080
what that might feel like.

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,000
>> Well, many would look at it as a glacial

112
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
type place. Some people think of the

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,280
clouds. Um some people think of maybe

114
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,360
even um a land flowing with milk and

115
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,280
honey because scriptures does allude to

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
that. Now obviously we know everyone

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,800
doesn't believe the same thing, but

118
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
research as you know it helps us be

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
stronger. It help us understand what

120
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,800
we're really saying and that way we can

121
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,720
fact check and then we learn more. and

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
fulfills our needs in different ways. An

123
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
even clearer picture of what happens

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,080
when we die is emerging from those who

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
have actually experienced death. They've

126
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,639
actually been there themselves. This

127
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,120
next story defies all odds. I know about

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,960
it personally. Take a look.

129
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,440
>> I was married in 2008 and 2 months later

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,720
I found out I was diagnosed with Hodkins

131
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,400
lymphoma. I began 6 months of

132
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,560
chemotherapy.

133
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,759
I ended up in remission. Everything was

134
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,479
going well. All of a sudden, one day I

135
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,960
just started not feeling well. I was

136
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,199
complaining to my husband that both of

137
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,680
my arms felt heavy. That's when he

138
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,960
rushed me to my local hospital. After we

139
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,520
arrived, I flatlined right in his arms

140
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,479
and doctors were unable to resuscitate

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,350
me for over 90 minutes. That was the

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,199
moment that I immediately crossed over.

143
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,199
[Music]

144
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,759
>> That was Sher who flatlined for nearly

145
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
90 minutes. She's here today to share

146
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,199
what happened after her heart stopped

147
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,600
and what she learned when she came back

148
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,600
to life. I've got to say I I know your

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,120
story personally, so I knew it took a

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
series of miracles to get just to be

151
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,720
sitting next to me today. But I want to

152
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,360
examine what was happening inside of

153
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,880
you, your experience while we were

154
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
outside trying to save your life.

155
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,039
>> Yeah.

156
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
>> What were those last moments like when

157
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,199
life was slipping away?

158
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,759
>> Um, I remember it being really quick

159
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,560
actually. Um, I remember a couple of

160
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,880
seconds right before I flatlined and I

161
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,479
remember saying to myself, "Wow, I had

162
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,199
spent my whole life worrying and and

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,720
seeing like wondering how do you prepare

164
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,440
for that moment when you die?" And the

165
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:33,360
first thought in my mind was that was so

166
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,800
easy and it was so quick and I remember

167
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,520
feeling so at peace.

168
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,039
There were other beings there as you

169
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,560
describe it. What were they doing? What

170
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,000
were they saying?

171
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,639
>> Yeah, it was interesting because um from

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,400
this this instant moment where I crossed

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,560
over, it it was really this beautiful

174
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,199
white white light. So, it wasn't scary.

175
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,440
Um I was very safe and I found myself

176
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,440
surrounded by like six beings and they

177
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,639
were surrounding me in like a circle and

178
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,840
I felt free. And I remember realizing

179
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,440
that they were talking to me

180
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,120
telepathically.

181
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,520
And one of the things that I was trying

182
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,240
to say to them was, "I know I died. I

183
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,240
know I know why I'm here. I love it

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,599
here. It's beautiful. It's peaceful. I

185
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,880
want to stay." And they gave me time to

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,800
think about that. And that's when um a

187
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,639
series of lifetime reviews began. And it

188
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,960
wasn't just a lifetime review of the

189
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,000
past life I had just left. It was a

190
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,560
lifetime review of just every single

191
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
lifetime that my soul had ever

192
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,000
experienced.

193
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,759
>> I'm smiling because I I've heard similar

194
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
stories from my own patients and since

195
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
doing the show and you know after 10

196
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
years you get to talk to all the real

197
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,039
world experts. You keep hearing these

198
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,240
recurrent concepts. Let me show everyone

199
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,479
else what they would have seen if they

200
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,560
were there watching you. And what saved

201
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,720
your life is technology that's

202
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,400
relatively new. Your past lives wouldn't

203
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,879
been able to benefit from it. something

204
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,280
called an elvad or left ventricular cy

205
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,840
device, a life-saving tool that kept

206
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,840
Sherry alive by hooking up to her heart

207
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,440
and then taking the blood out of the

208
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,280
heart because the heart can't pump it on

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,960
its own anymore. And this mechanical

210
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
device and you know it sort of

211
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,000
circulates through here and pumps the

212
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
blood back up. So it it's a piggyback

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
heart. Now, I helped research and

214
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,599
develop uh these elvads and I ran

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,560
Columbia's program where Sher actually

216
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,280
had her surgery and then the program

217
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,960
when I came to do the show was led by my

218
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,599
colleague and close friend of 25 years,

219
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,039
Dr. Yoshi Naka. He now runs the program

220
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,399
and he was the one who actually saved

221
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,760
Sher's life.

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,279
>> And I'm always curious to talk to

223
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,039
physicians, especially if I ever fall

224
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,279
over and need heart surgery, send me to

225
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,680
him.

226
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,000
>> Yes.

227
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,760
>> The best surgeon that I know. So what

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,519
were you thinking about when you first

229
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,600
saw Sherry's case? This is not going to

230
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,399
be a pretty picture for any physician to

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,279
look at.

232
00:08:52,399 --> 00:09:00,399
>> Well, that I thought the chance is slim.

233
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:04,240
Uh simply based on the uh the history

234
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:07,440
that she was uh CPR, she had CPR 90

235
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,760
minutes. The uh our data shows that that

236
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,160
kind of a long CPR usually not

237
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
is not associated with a good result.

238
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,399
>> Yeah. Not having a good result is the

239
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,399
same as having a really bad result.

240
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,120
>> And Sher, what do you have to say to Dr.

241
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,760
Naka?

242
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,000
>> Oh my goodness. I mean,

243
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,160
>> thank you. Thank you for everything.

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,160
>> My pleasure.

245
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,120
>> Without without the ELVAD, I would not

246
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,440
still be alive. Um, that's for sure. I

247
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,800
was on the ELVAD for 4 and a half years

248
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,240
until my heart transplant. So, thank you

249
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,200
for not only saving my life but being so

250
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,360
supportive and so good to my family and

251
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,720
we are forever forever grateful to you.

252
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,920
>> I'm glad you're doing well. Sherry,

253
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,760
thank you for sharing your story. Yoshi,

254
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,360
as always, for being the best. Thanks

255
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,200
for being here. Up next, what another

256
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,800
woman who nearly died says pushed her

257
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
back to life and what everyone who's

258
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,920
lost a loved one needs to know right

259
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,230
now. Stay with us.

260
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
[Music]

261
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,480
[Applause]

262
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,480
Ah, the sizzle of bacon.

263
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,600
Could this breakfast stable put you at

264
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,560
risk? The story you haven't heard. Is

265
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,880
there a bacon cover up?

266
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,120
And we've got the scoop on low calorie

267
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,440
ice cream. They claim you can eat the

268
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,720
whole pint. Is that a blessing or a

269
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,839
curse? Plus, six reasons to fall for

270
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,600
Shamora Moore. It's real.

271
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,120
All new.

272
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,760
That's coming up on Monday.

273
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,200
>> When I was a psychologist working with

274
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,880
the terminally ill cancer patients, many

275
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,320
times they saw old relatives or angels

276
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,640
and I doubted that it actually could be.

277
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,320
But that changed when I had my own

278
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,800
experience.

279
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,360
I was working out at the gym and all of

280
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,560
a sudden I had burst a cerebral

281
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,959
aneurysm. The ambulance took me to the

282
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,160
hospital. I was admitted into the

283
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,920
surgical ICU unit. They said, "You're

284
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,240
really sick. We're going to take you to

285
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,560
another room."

286
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,440
That's when I looked up and saw the

287
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,600
light and I started moving toward it and

288
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,760
I realized I was crossing over.

289
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,079
>> Today, we've been asking, "What do we

290
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,079
know about where we go when we die?" You

291
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,320
just heard from Mary Joe whose friends

292
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,279
and family were preparing to say goodbye

293
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,560
to her,

294
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,959
>> but you're still here.

295
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,160
>> Yes.

296
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,040
>> Which I'm happy about.

297
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,880
>> I'm very happy.

298
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,600
>> What do you remember about those moments

299
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,120
when you're on the brink on the next to

300
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,680
the abyss of of death?

301
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,399
>> What I remember is that this light I saw

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,680
was so interesting. It was not like a

303
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,240
light I had ever seen before. And I was

304
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,920
in it. It's like it came and embraced

305
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:02,480
me. I was in it. And as I was going into

306
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:06,160
it, I felt like I also saw behind me and

307
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,760
I was able to see my body, but I had no

308
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:15,040
attachment to it at all. And then the

309
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,200
the place the the tunnel was so warm and

310
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,079
just comforting.

311
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,480
And as I moved through it, then I came

312
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,240
to a larger room.

313
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,519
>> And what ultimately pushed you back

314
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,639
towards us? Well, when I came to this

315
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,760
other room that was a pink luminous

316
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,360
color, I had the feeling that God was

317
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,760
holding me and he talked to me and he

318
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,120
called me by my name and the first thing

319
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,160
he said is, "Mary Joe, you cannot stay."

320
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:51,040
And I was very upset because I wanted to

321
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:54,720
stay. It it was so beautiful. And um I

322
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,959
started saying why not? I protested and

323
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:02,560
then it its voice was just in my skin

324
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,920
and it said, "Let me ask you one thing.

325
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,279
Have you ever loved another human like

326
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,320
you've been loved here?" And I said,

327
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,240
"No, it's impossible."

328
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,000
>> But you had to come back even though you

329
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,120
wanted to stay.

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,800
>> Yes. It told me I said when I said I

331
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,399
could not um love like that, it held me

332
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,519
close and it said you can do better. And

333
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,120
>> you can do better.

334
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,959
>> I woke up

335
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:37,079
>> with your husband next to you. with my

336
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:37,079
husband crying next to me and

337
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:47,200
and he was um really scared and he said

338
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:50,160
that they had told him that um I may not

339
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,760
come back the same but he had to sign

340
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,440
these consents and he was so scared to

341
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,920
make this decision and I said just sign

342
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,120
it. I'm not going to die. I just talked

343
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,920
to God and I didn't know in what

344
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,279
capacity, but I knew I would live.

345
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,880
>> Let me bring Sher back in because both

346
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,320
of you have had near-death experiences.

347
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,839
You've had a second chance. What do you

348
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,440
have to say to people who may have lost

349
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,279
someone they've loved dearly and are

350
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,680
feeling pain because of that?

351
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:22,639
>> Yeah, I mean, I I absolutely felt

352
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,079
connected and could still connect with

353
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,240
people that were in in my life even

354
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,839
though I was on the other side. And I

355
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
really want people to know, especially

356
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,519
around the times of the holidays and

357
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,000
especially when you're used to having

358
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:40,160
these special traditions with your loved

359
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,160
ones, they may not physically be around,

360
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,639
but they can still feel you. They're

361
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,360
still connected to you. And you can take

362
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,800
the time to really just reach out and

363
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,760
connect with them. You can speak with

364
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,079
them. You can think about them and know

365
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,120
that you're really not separated from

366
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,079
them. They're just in another form.

367
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,600
And all is not lost. They are still

368
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,959
there. They're still connected to your

369
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
heart. If

370
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,199
>> you don't mind, I I don't do this too

371
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,480
often, but there's someone in the

372
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,000
audience who seems to have been touched

373
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,519
by this.

374
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,399
>> You okay if I ask you a question?

375
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,399
>> Yes.

376
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,519
>> Why was uh Sherry's comments affected

377
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
you so deeply?

378
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,760
>> Both of us have lost pretty much our

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,680
whole families. As a matter of fact, we

380
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,920
were sitting right over there last year

381
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,560
when uh his mom was here with us and

382
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,440
she's not now. And uh we're dreading the

383
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,600
holidays. So, because they're all gone,

384
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,920
but you guys have brought us so much

385
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,000
comfort saying that. And not that we

386
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,560
>> I hope the holiday is a measure for you.

387
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,920
>> Thank you.

388
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,959
>> God bless you for coming back. Thank

389
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,040
you.

390
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,890
>> Sherry Mary Joe, thanks for for being

391
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,650
here. We'll be right back, everybody.

392
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,800
[Applause]

393
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,880
[Music]

394
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,839
>> These roses are for a group of women who

395
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,040
made me their #mancrush Monday. I was

396
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,839
surprised and honored. The women of the

397
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,720
real. Dearra, Lonnie, Adrien, and

398
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,720
Janine. Come on up.

399
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,920
There's something else.

400
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:17,079
[Applause]

401
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,079
How are you?

402
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,279
>> Gosh, I love the energy.

403
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,320
So look, Adrian, I was so flattered. I

404
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,320
really was. And I know the ideal dream

405
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,160
is to get get checked out plus the

406
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,399
hoverboard date, but

407
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,800
>> but I'm a heart surgeon.

408
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,360
>> Okay.

409
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,199
>> So, I thought I'd honor you with a

410
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,320
little bit of poetry

411
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
>> from the heart.

412
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,720
>> Oh, what's happening?

413
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,199
>> Wait. Oh, cute.

414
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,120
>> Some say it takes two, but you are the

415
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,680
one who gives my heart

416
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,320
>> palpitations.

417
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,880
Lonnie, Lonnie, it's your comedy that

418
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,560
fills me with jubilation.

419
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,800
>> Oh,

420
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,600
>> Genie, you you give my heart a workout

421
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,600
full of circulation.

422
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,280
>> And Adrien, oh my Adrien, without your

423
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,280
friendship, I'd ask for a do not

424
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,280
resuscitation.

425
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,640
>> Yes.

426
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,520
>> Very lovely.

427
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,839
>> That was amazing.

428
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,720
I could never top you guys, but I think

429
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,240
>> all my dreams come true right now.

430
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,079
>> Oh my goodness.

431
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,120
>> So, part of the reason I want to thank

432
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,000
sexy. Yeah,

433
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,559
>> you're very kind.

434
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
>> Very nice.

435
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,440
>> Oh, I like that.

436
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,440
>> Very nice.

437
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,200
>> It's fun. So, I've enjoyed visiting you.

438
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,039
I enjoyed watching the real and I know

439
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
you have lots of questions. So, we can

440
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,200
dive into it. I know you got a long

441
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,520
laundry list.

442
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,240
>> Okay.

443
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,039
>> Who's first?

444
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,600
>> I'll go first.

445
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,200
>> First. Take it.

446
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,480
>> Okay. Is hangry actually a real thing?

447
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,080
And why do some people experience more

448
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,360
than others? Like Lonnie.

449
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
>> Now, you all know hangry is when you're

450
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,080
angry when you're hungry. We all know

451
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,360
that, right? We have that in our friend.

452
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,400
So, Lonnie, since she brought you and

453
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,640
threw you under the bus.

454
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
>> Yeah.

455
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,799
>> Can I just brag on you for a second?

456
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
>> Oh, what?

457
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,440
>> The Lonnie's loss challenge. You

458
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,280
probably all heard about it,

459
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,360
>> but I've specifically seen it on Lonnie.

460
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,520
I've got some pictures of you. went from

461
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,919
a size 24 to a size 18 if I can brag on

462
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,120
you.

463
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,600
>> That's a major difference.

464
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,919
>> Thank you.

465
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,080
>> It's so It is hard. It's kudos to you,

466
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,840
but sometimes hanger accompanies the

467
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,760
loss in dress sizes.

468
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,000
>> Yes. And I just want to thank my co-host

469
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,320
because they deal with me being, you

470
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,520
know, hangry. So, we really need help to

471
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,640
help me to be better to my co-host.

472
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,840
>> Right. Let me show you what's going on

473
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,080
with you, L. But it happens to all of

474
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,000
us. Most of us. I should say all of us.

475
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,840
When your when your blood sugar falls,

476
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,600
right, your body's natural response is

477
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,120
to try to help the dropping blood sugar

478
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,559
by elevating two hormones called

479
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,400
cortisol and epinephrine. You've heard

480
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,240
of them, right? And those make you

481
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,360
hangry because they're there for the

482
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,799
blood sugar, but they're not there for

483
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,160
all the other side effects of taking

484
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,600
hormones, right? So all of a sudden

485
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,440
you're irritable, you're angry, you're

486
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,960
frustrated, and without realizing it,

487
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
hangry is coming out of every word you

488
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,120
say.

489
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,919
>> Wow, wow. That is me. I am that thing

490
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,000
right there

491
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,440
>> with hangry pouring out. And epinephrine

492
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,280
makes your heart go faster, right?

493
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,880
>> It does. But it's interesting, hormones

494
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,400
influence in such powerful ways. We

495
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,080
don't always figure it out till later

496
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
on. But again, you want those hormones

497
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
because they get your blood sugar up

498
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,559
temporarily.

499
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
>> So the best thing you can do is use food

500
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,440
instead of the hormones. So what do you

501
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,240
snack on when you feel hungry?

502
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,400
>> Carbs. We do a lot of chips. We do pop

503
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,440
chips. We do skinny popcorn.

504
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,520
>> Pita chips.

505
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,360
>> Skinny popcorn's good. Okay. Chips. I'm

506
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,120
worried about definitely not skinny.

507
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,480
M&M's. You know the problem is our

508
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,840
natural instinct is to take sugar in

509
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,039
because we're low on sugar. But the

510
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,320
things that have a lot of sugar in them

511
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,080
actually mess up your hormones even

512
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,840
worse. So they worsen the hanginess.

513
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,760
You're okay for 5 minutes. You burn

514
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,960
greatly but briefly then

515
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,280
>> you can't and then you can't pull up

516
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,039
anymore cuz you got no sustenance.

517
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,000
>> So I've got the solution for you. Tell

518
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,760
us

519
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,559
>> cuz I love you so dearly. This is what I

520
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,840
eat.

521
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,320
>> Blackberries.

522
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
>> Really?

523
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,000
>> That's me in my dressing room right

524
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
there.

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
>> You know they say the blacker the berry,

526
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,400
the sweeter the juice.

527
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,240
>> Wa

528
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,120
wa.

529
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,360
Yes.

530
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,600
>> Well, these these are all yours, my

531
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,919
dear. Blackberry from Blackberry.

532
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,039
>> All right. Speaking of of topics that

533
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,080
are interesting, you got another

534
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,919
question right here, Lahy.

535
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,960
>> Mhm.

536
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,440
>> Okay. I enjoy wine, and we all do.

537
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,000
>> Yeah.

538
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,640
>> Is it still okay? Yeah. Is it still

539
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,840
beneficial to have one glass a day?

540
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
>> Just one glass.

541
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,760
>> Just one.

542
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
>> Well, you know, I might

543
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,720
>> She'll have two.

544
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,799
>> Maybe two. How how many members of the

545
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,080
panel like to enjoy a glass of wine?

546
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,200
>> Oh, yes.

547
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,640
>> Oh, Adrian doesn't.

548
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,919
>> I have recognized that just at I'll be

549
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,880
35 in a week and a half, I can get a

550
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,720
hangover from just one glass of wine.

551
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,640
>> No, I'm not lying. Like, I literally and

552
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,919
it's just not worth it to me anymore.

553
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,280
>> Yeah. Well, it's one of the problems.

554
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,960
>> Makes me feel terrible.

555
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,200
>> Well, then I'll just take her a glass of

556
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,320
wine.

557
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,320
>> Like, I literally will feel awful.

558
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,520
And I and I used to love drinking when I

559
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,120
was younger.

560
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,280
>> Guys, cheers guys.

561
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,480
>> Cheers.

562
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,720
>> I feel so left out.

563
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,640
>> Dr. Oz, this is so cool. It's real wine.

564
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,080
>> I know it's good wine. But here's the

565
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,240
catch. Should you be drinking it? So,

566
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,760
here's the thing. All my career, I've

567
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,440
been telling folks cuz I was told this

568
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,960
by my teachers that a glass of wine a

569
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
day was actually good for you. And we

570
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,000
know that other parts of the world that

571
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,840
tends to be sort of true. But then this

572
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,960
huge study that just came out breaking

573
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,480
news everybody

574
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,760
>> and it's alarming to me because it says

575
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
that current recommendations probably

576
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,919
aren't right

577
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,520
>> that we should not be drinking a glass

578
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,880
of wine a day. It says that drinking a

579
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,480
glass of wine every day can increase the

580
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,520
chance of dying for example from cancer

581
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,240
by 30%.

582
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
>> What?

583
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
>> Yes. What a downer, right? That's

584
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,159
stated. That's stated. There's a lot of

585
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,600
other studies that say historically like

586
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,200
when I was learning the stuff that is

587
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,880
actually okay. So what are you going to

588
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,159
say? I went through them all. I had my

589
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,080
medical unit. You know we got this whole

590
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,600
group of folks are pretty young doctors.

591
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,880
>> Sure. that that went through this all

592
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,400
and after a lot of effort we came up

593
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,440
with a conclusion that I think most

594
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,840
doctors will agree with.

595
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,360
>> Okay.

596
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,720
>> Which is you can protect your health

597
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,760
with wine because it does have a benefit

598
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,080
to your heart.

599
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,039
>> If you drink it once every other day, so

600
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,960
three times a week.

601
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,600
>> So three times a week. That's not that

602
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,440
bad. I

603
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,840
>> not bad. You can do that.

604
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,760
>> Yes.

605
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,039
>> Not that size though.

606
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,840
>> Up next, another hot topic. We're

607
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,679
investigating longlasting polish. Nail

608
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,039
polish. It doesn't chip. You guys all

609
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
like it. You're all wearing it. Looks

610
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,799
pretty. But there's an ugly truth about

611
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,480
the health risks of using them. Stick

612
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,640
around.

613
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,640
[Applause]

614
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,880
>> Ah, the sizzle of bacon. Could this

615
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,280
breakfast staple put you at risk? The

616
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,200
story you haven't heard. That's coming

617
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,200
up on Monday.

618
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,200
>> Hey fam. So, I'm backstage at the Real

619
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,240
and we are about to go see Dr. Oz. I

620
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,919
don't know if you know this, but we're

621
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,360
kind of obsessed with nails up in here.

622
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,760
So, we're going to see if he can match

623
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,080
the manicure to the host. You got this,

624
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,840
Dr. Oz.

625
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,919
>> So, I always love a good challenge.

626
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,080
We're going to see which of these

627
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,799
manicures are also beautifully done, are

628
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,159
owned by which member of the real. So,

629
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,280
first of all, I'm going to go with

630
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,640
Lonnie on that one.

631
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,840
>> Oh, how you guess that?

632
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,080
>> I'm just guessing. Beginner's luck.

633
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,440
>> Uh, Jeie, I'll take you on this one.

634
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,880
>> Okay,

635
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,799
>> let's see. Uh,

636
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,960
>> hey.

637
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,880
All right, I'll go with Adrien and

638
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,360
Tamara.

639
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,039
>> Right.

640
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,640
>> And actually, I didn't cheat. Well, I

641
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,600
had a little help from Ronnie, so I

642
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,880
didn't cheat.

643
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,559
>> Okay, now that I passed that test,

644
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,480
question is, are they good for you? So,

645
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,159
is longlasting nail polish, which I know

646
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,320
is dominating everyone's

647
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,960
>> attention span worthwhile. What do you

648
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,360
guys think?

649
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,960
>> Who cares? They're so worth it.

650
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,799
>> Okay. Do I think it's good for you? No.

651
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,480
Do I think it's like gonna kill you? No,

652
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,600
either. But maybe I could be wrong.

653
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,120
>> So, have you ever wondered what's in

654
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,840
those acrylics? Those different

655
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,600
chemicals and then

656
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,080
>> I have smell it.

657
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,919
>> Yeah.

658
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
>> I always wonder why they have a mask on

659
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,960
and why I don't.

660
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
>> True. It's true.

661
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,280
>> Do you all use longl lasting nail

662
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,400
polishes?

663
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,640
>> Yeah. Gel.

664
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,159
>> I I do the gel because they last for two

665
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
weeks longer usually.

666
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,320
>> I do it cuz I'm lazy cuz I don't want to

667
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,320
keep, you know, repainting. Plus, we

668
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,080
work so hard. So, I just just, you know,

669
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,400
there it's longlasting. Great.

670
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,000
>> And we bake them in acrylic. We do

671
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,320
acrylics going through. See, I don't do

672
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,960
acrylics. Is gel Are gels just as bad as

673
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,159
acrylics?

674
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,520
>> Well, here's the thing. These

675
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,720
long-lasting polishes all have something

676
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,760
special in them. They wouldn't last so

677
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,760
long otherwise, right? They're different

678
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,360
from regular polishes. So, there was a

679
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,200
reason the top the top coat, by the way,

680
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,880
is is more resilient, harder, so that's

681
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,039
why it works. And there were chemicals

682
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,240
in these polishes that worried me a lot.

683
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,080
I did shows on them.

684
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,559
>> None of them contain those chemicals.

685
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,440
>> None of them.

686
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,120
>> Oh, wow. Really?

687
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,320
>> Yes. So, kudos to the manufacturers.

688
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,000
They actually listened to what we're

689
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,600
talking about.

690
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,120
>> That's good.

691
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,200
But again, another question that that

692
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,559
takes care of the toxicity issue, but I

693
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,400
want to talk about what happens to your

694
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,960
own natural nail when you have those

695
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,640
long-lasting polishes on. So, Junior,

696
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,679
come on over cuz you're you're curious

697
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,799
about that.

698
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,039
>> What's happening? Face the truth.

699
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,840
One of my audience members volunteers. I

700
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,240
Oh,

701
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,640
>> okay.

702
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,400
>> She wants extra wine. So, Marcy's

703
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,919
joining us and she's going to allow us

704
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,880
to put her nails

705
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,720
>> I under a magnifying glass. I understood

706
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,640
you took your polish off for us today.

707
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,520
>> I did. It was not easy.

708
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,080
>> May I examine you?

709
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
>> Yes.

710
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,360
>> Okay. So, you notice there's one nail

711
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,159
here that's been left

712
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,840
>> barren. This is Now, see the nail?

713
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,600
>> See how it's sort of chippy? Let me go

714
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,720
back up here to the See the cuticle,

715
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,039
>> girl.

716
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,320
>> Now,

717
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,760
>> that is not pretty.

718
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,120
>> Well, first of all, be brave for letting

719
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,039
me do this, but secondly, you're not

720
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,000
alone either, cuz see how chip see the

721
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,679
actual nail is chipping?

722
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,159
>> Yeah. What's it supposed to look like?

723
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,279
Smooth.

724
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,440
>> Well, it's supposed to look more like

725
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,440
this.

726
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,799
>> Oh. Doctor,

727
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,720
>> that's a healthy looking nail.

728
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,559
>> Now, I have to scrub my nails to

729
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,840
operate. So, it's not quite what it

730
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,600
should be, but it's it's a little

731
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,799
better. And the main difference is I

732
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,440
don't put nail polish on, at least in

733
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,799
public,

734
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,919
>> right? So, so, so when you see that,

735
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,720
does that makes you concerned at all,

736
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,000
Marcy?

737
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,799
>> Absolutely. I mean, even without that,

738
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,240
I'm concerned.

739
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,640
>> And Genie, these beautiful fingers are

740
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
yours.

741
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,640
>> I mean, look at my manicure, you guys.

742
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,880
Everybody, look at the tips. It's a half

743
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,720
matte with a little shine. I mean,

744
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,840
elegantly, I like everything you do, but

745
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,880
are you worried about the underlying

746
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,799
nail?

747
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
>> I should be, but I don't know why I

748
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,760
should be because to be honest with you,

749
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,520
even if it looks like that underneath,

750
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,600
that's why I keep getting it covered.

751
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,640
So, what what should I be afraid of?

752
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,000
>> Let's join your colleagues. Thank you

753
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,120
very much, Marcy. Cuz I think that's the

754
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,960
key question. What we going to do? I

755
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,159
know I know you're not going to stop

756
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,279
your nail polish,

757
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,640
>> right? I've already tried that

758
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,840
experiment with my daughters. Doesn't

759
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,520
work. Right. So here's what I first of

760
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,480
all there you know nail polish the

761
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,720
holiday is a idea that's catching on now

762
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,640
which means when you take off the old

763
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,960
polish give it a couple days

764
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,000
>> for your natural nail to breathe. Okay?

765
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,279
>> Because the reason these polishes work

766
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,799
in part is they can really embed

767
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,559
themselves deep into the top layers of

768
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,240
the nails. So when you take it off

769
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,760
allowing them to sort of regenerate a

770
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,279
little bit is valuable. But the other

771
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,919
thing is you guys probably use acetone

772
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,640
to take them off.

773
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,039
>> Yeah.

774
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,000
>> Right. I don't I get I get it. It's

775
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,600
faster. But there are non acetone

776
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,120
products out there that don't dry out

777
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,760
the nail cuz you know the part of what

778
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,000
happens is the the long-lasting polishes

779
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,440
suffocate the nail then you dehydrate

780
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,120
them more with the acetone.

781
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,039
>> So use one of the non acetone products

782
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,080
takes a few seconds extra but that

783
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:16,480
>> a few seconds.

784
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
All right.

785
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,520
>> You're right. It takes a lot longer when

786
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,520
you're rehearsing for the real. Just sit

787
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,919
there for a couple hours. Peel it off.

788
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,240
>> All right.

789
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,919
>> All right. Now, this whole thing so far

790
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,120
has been a preamble to what I'm really

791
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,200
excited about, which is your last

792
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,880
question. Cuz when we come back, the

793
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,559
real question these women have been

794
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,600
wanting to ask me since they got here,

795
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,520
you're going to hear it and it might

796
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,760
make you blush. In fact, I know it will.

797
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,760
>> Oh, no.

798
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:47,440
[Music]

799
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,520
We're back with the burning medical

800
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,000
questions and the host of the real. This

801
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,840
is one they've been dying to ask. One of

802
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,360
you wrote down a question with a card on

803
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,600
it and slipped it backstage to my

804
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,880
producer, Tanal. So, I'm just warning

805
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,520
everybody, it might be inappropriate for

806
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,679
kids. Uh,

807
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,440
>> oh, yeah. I'm not sure yet. Tenil, can

808
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,399
you read it, please?

809
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,640
>> Is it possible to break a man's penis

810
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,039
during sex?

811
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,080
>> Good question.

812
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,039
>> Good question. But the question, did you

813
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,720
ask it? So, I actually had my audience,

814
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,159
>> look at all the guys in the audience.

815
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,880
Their faces like

816
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,200
>> they all sat up tall. They sat up tall.

817
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,799
>> So, I asked the audience who they

818
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,159
thought asked that question cuz I was

819
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,679
curious what they think about you guys

820
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,640
cuz they're all big fans, right? So,

821
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,960
each audience member was supposed to

822
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,120
place a little marble into a jar if they

823
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,720
thought that co-host of the real asked

824
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,159
the question. Here they are. You see

825
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,159
who's voting for you, who's not voting

826
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,279
for you, right? There you are. All four

827
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,520
names there, right? And who did they

828
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,080
think asked the broken penis question to

829
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,919
Neil?

830
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,000
>> Who's the winner?

831
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,640
>> What name is that?

832
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,520
>> Lonnie.

833
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,600
>> Well, it looks like Lonnie.

834
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,799
>> Lonnie Love.

835
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,120
>> Lonnie Love.

836
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,480
>> Really? Audience?

837
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,640
>> I just got a visual.

838
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,360
>> I have an electrical engineering degree.

839
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,159
I already know the answer.

840
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,720
>> Go get her.

841
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,360
>> All right.

842
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,640
>> Go get her. All right. No. So, you

843
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,480
didn't ask the question, I gather from

844
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,600
that response. All right. Will the real

845
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,600
guilty host please stand?

846
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,240
>> Oh,

847
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,440
good question.

848
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,279
>> You said stand.

849
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,520
>> I'm standing.

850
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,279
>> I'm I'm still newly married and I'm

851
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,640
trying to hold on to a good thing, you

852
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,840
know? I don't want things going wrong.

853
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,039
>> Is that why you asked the question?

854
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,399
>> I just want to make sure.

855
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,000
>> Is that what sparked the question?

856
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,360
>> Yeah. I don't Yeah. So, if uh

857
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,360
>> this can get a little crazy.

858
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,720
>> Yes, I'm proud of you for that. Uh if

859
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,919
you're brave enough to join me over

860
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,360
here, I'm going to show you what's going

861
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,080
down with this question. I am brave

862
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,960
enough to

863
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,240
>> It actually happens. It happens.

864
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,679
>> You see?

865
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,120
>> You see?

866
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,640
>> All right. So, I made you a a simplified

867
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,960
animation. I'll call it that. All right.

868
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,120
And we're standing on it, right? And

869
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,279
there's actually a casing around the

870
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,200
penis that's pretty thin. And when the

871
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,960
penis flexes like this, I'm standing on

872
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,039
it. But look, look right there. It

873
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,640
breaks. See the crack? And when that

874
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,559
break happens, now you got a problem

875
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,480
because it's called the tuna albina,

876
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,159
that casing. And when it begins, lots of

877
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,919
blood starts to pour out. It fills up

878
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,520
the penis with blood, which is not very

879
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,440
prettyl looking. But on the outside,

880
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,360
here's what you see. That big growing

881
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,640
bruise, the swelling.

882
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,320
>> You haven't seen that, have you?

883
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,120
>> No. But I don't want to. I want to avoid

884
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,399
this.

885
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,200
>> That's Well,

886
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,399
>> what can cause this? Well, uh, it's

887
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,039
usually younger men,

888
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,840
>> oh,

889
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,480
>> who are involved,

890
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
>> okay?

891
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,200
>> Men in their 20s and 30s, they tend to

892
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,919
be more vigorous, I'll say.

893
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,679
>> Mhm.

894
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,360
>> And the problem with that, of course, by

895
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,080
it can happen to any age group person.

896
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,120
So, but there are certain sexual

897
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,039
positions that tend to be more

898
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,039
problematic than others,

899
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,240
>> which I I can point them out if you're

900
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,320
interested.

901
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,440
>> Gosh.

902
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,159
>> So,

903
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,399
>> this can get this can get crazy. So when

904
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,159
please please have a seat. When uh when

905
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,520
when the woman's on top, it's a bit more

906
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,760
of a problem

907
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,080
>> because usually it happens because an

908
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,440
erect penis hits something hard, misses

909
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,840
the target, so to speak.

910
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,200
>> Oh,

911
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,840
>> and when you miss the target, then the

912
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,039
guy would jump up as a snapping sound

913
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,600
>> which you hear.

914
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,799
>> What's the

915
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,799
>> I didn't know a penis can snap.

916
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,320
>> Well, Tamar is curious now.

917
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,640
>> Yes. See, it was a good question. You

918
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,640
know that that that casing that that

919
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,600
little you don't have you don't have a

920
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,120
>> this happened to me in ' 86. So I'm just

921
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,080
listening. It happened to me.

922
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,760
>> Keep going. Keep going.

923
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,240
>> So you have like a hot dog has a little

924
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,000
piece of so the skin on the outside that

925
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,559
that cracks. It snaps

926
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,840
>> and you can hear it and then once it

927
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,840
cracks all the blood happens and you

928
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,559
actually have to requires an operation

929
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
or you'll be

930
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,880
>> Look at their faces.

931
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,559
>> An operation.

932
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,399
>> Like what do they do? that you actually

933
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,919
stitch back the casing. Otherwise, the

934
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,720
penis will stay bent the rest of his

935
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,519
life.

936
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,080
>> How long do you have to abstain?

937
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,120
>> Oh, no.

938
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,159
>> How long?

939
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,919
>> How long does that take you to?

940
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,880
>> We're going to keep talking after a

941
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,279
couple weeks.

942
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:14,440
>> Did you see that? That's why they say we

943
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,440
men, we made you and we could break you.

944
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,440

>> Make it tasty.

954
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,720

[Applause]

958
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:48,080
[Music]

959
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,480
Nurses. Ah, nurses. They are the heart

960
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,240
and soul of our healthcare. and I know

961
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,480
firsthand the integral role that they

962
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,320
play in providing education and care and

963
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,640
especially healing to everyone around

964
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,640
them. I personally have depended on the

965
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640
wisdom and the guidance, support and

966
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,960
nurturing of nurses throughout my career

967
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,720
as a surgeon, which is why I am so proud

968
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,519
to be celebrating them with the first

969
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,000
ever future of nursing scholarship

970
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:16,600
contest.

971
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,600
They deserve this. Take a look.

972
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,159
It's a global scholarship contest that

973
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,880
started in Asia with our partner Esana

974
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:29,159
Health Sciences from China to the

975
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,159
Philippines and onto Singapore.

976
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,080
>> We wanted to reward nurses who represent

977
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,640
the future of health. Find out how they

978
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,679
are helping you. And now the contest is

979
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,519
making its way to the US. We've already

980
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,399
received hundreds of submissions from

981
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,880
nurses around the world. They told us

982
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,679
what inspired them to become a nurse.

983
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,840
>> My mother unexpectedly passed away. Ever

984
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,559
since then, I've had a bigger drive to

985
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,240
be something.

986
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,960
>> I can't stand being powerless, being in

987
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,480
a state or a place where I don't feel

988
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,240
like I'm doing as much as I can.

989
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,320
>> My dad had a heart attack. My mom had a

990
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,919
total thyroidctomy. I share those things

991
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,799
because that's what inspired me to

992
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,879
become a nurse.

993
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,399
>> What the job means to them.

994
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,200
>> It's my my purpose. I found something I

995
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:18,159
see myself doing far into the future.

996
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,760
>> The nurse isn't just there to heal the

997
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,639
person physically to help with their

998
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,119
pain, but they're also there to be that

999
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,200
patient's advocate to make sure that

1000
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,760
they are mentally getting what they need

1001
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,919
and the emotional support that they need

1002
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,240
>> and why they represent the future of

1003
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,839
nursing. When I become a nurse, which I

1004
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,679
know I'm going to for sure become a

1005
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,240
nurse, I'm going to make sure that every

1006
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,079
patient is treated how how I wanted my

1007
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,960
grandma to be treated inside of that

1008
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,520
nursing home.

1009
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,280
>> I want to be a voice and guide other

1010
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,720
people and help other people.

1011
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,720
>> I want to grow and I want to be the best

1012
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,520
nurse I can possibly be.

1013
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,359
>> Nurses, the unsung heroes of healthcare,

1014
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,680
dedicate their lives to helping and

1015
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,839
healing others. That's why I partnered

1016
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,240
up with USANA to give nurses this

1017
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,640
ultimate opportunity. The future of

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,920
future of nursing because I want a

1028

1029
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,200
and I want to make a difference in

people lives every day.

1031
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,460

nursing?

1033

[Music]

1034
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:42,000
[Applause]

1035
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,680
Oh my, the submissions keep rolling in.

1036
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,280
It's not too late for you to enter. I'm

1037
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,040
here to tell you more about this contest

1038
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,960
is health coach and former nurse Angela

1039
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,480
Gray, who's here on behalf of my trusted

1040
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,640
sponsorship partner, USANA Health

1041
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,599
Sciences. Why was it so important for

1042
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,599
USANA to start this this contest?

1043
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,760
>> Um, I think actually because I am a

1044
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,079
former nurse. I grew up with my mom who

1045
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,240
was a nurse. I've seen firsthand myself

1046
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,400
like you've shared how important nursing

1047
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,320
is and how hard they work. I had an

1048
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,160
actual experience with my son and a

1049
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,720
nurse who almost died when he was a

1050
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,320
baby. And so um the first, you know,

1051
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,280
they're often the first responders like

1052
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,119
you mentioned. I think um the the stance

1053
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,280
that USANA is taking and being so

1054
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,040
supportive of these nurses and what they

1055
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,480
do is so so important and shows their

1056
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,560
support in all parts of the health

1057
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,800
industry. So I'm really really proud to

1058
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,400
be part of that. My mom was a nurse. I

1059
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,960
grew up watching that. My daughter's a

1060
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,359
nurse. My son and my other two daughters

1061
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,200
are both in the health industry. So it's

1062
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,040
a big part of who we are as well. So I'm

1063
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
so excited to see you son of support the

1064
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,000
nurses in this way.

1065
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,680
I spoke earlier of how much I've been

1066
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,680
touched by nurses, but I remember

1067
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,960
vividly Flora Wong who was the head

1068
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,599
nurse in the operating room when I

1069
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,200
started. Yeah.

1070
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,720
>> And Flora would look over my shoulder

1071
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,320
when I was finishing open heart surgery.

1072
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,079
And one of the big complications we have

1073
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,599
is bleeding because you have to give

1074
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,200
heavy doses of blood thinners. You put

1075
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,040
hundreds of stitch of stitches in so

1076
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,280
little holes can bleed. And she would

1077
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,960
tell me if she thought the patient had

1078
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,599
stopped bleeding enough to close their

1079
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,920
chest.

1080
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,760
>> Yeah.

1081
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,040
>> And she say, you know, I say Flora, what

1082
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,320
do you think? says, "It must be more

1083
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,720
like the Sahara Desert."

1084
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
>> Yeah.

1085
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,240
>> And that was her goal. We had to be that

1086
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,160
dry, that free of blood.

1087
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,680
>> And it wasn't just nice to have her pat

1088
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,960
on the back and say, "Good job." It also

1089
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,960
meant that someone with a lot of

1090
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,640
experience who had seen many, many

1091
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,480
operations and knew what success looked

1092
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,520
like and what failure could look like,

1093
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,040
warned me,

1094
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,800
>> which is what nurses often do. They're

1095
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,640
that early detection system. They'll

1096
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,839
often tip us off to issues we may not

1097
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,880
pick up on, which is why when you talk

1098
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,800
to your nurses,

1099
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,839
>> they translate that back to us. It makes

1100
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,280
everything work better.

1101
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,599
>> Absolutely. So, what attributes are you

1102
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,760
looking for in this nursing competition?

1103
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,839
>> Um, not only a knowledgeable nurse, like

1104
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,160
you were saying, for sure. Absolutely. A

1105
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,640
competent nurse, but really I love the

1106
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,359
way um that we're moving in towards more

1107
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,960
holistic care. So, really someone that

1108
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,079
first of all and foremost that they

1109
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,920
understand how important their own

1110
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,000
self-care is. This is a really, really

1111
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,920
tough job, right? And often times we put

1112
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,280
ourselves last. So, that's really

1113
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,599
important to me because you can

1114
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,680
recognize a nurse when she walks in if

1115
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,119
she cares about herself, quite honestly.

1116
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,680
And if she does, then that's going to be

1117
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,160
paid forward in her compassion, in the

1118
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,160
innovative way she gives the care, being

1119
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,359
motivated. So all of those reasons. So

1120
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,480
self-care is really important and

1121
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,960
looking for um a well-rounded nurse who

1122
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,240
understands the holistic aspect of it.

1123
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,160
>> So we've been doing this competition

1124
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,440
around the world as you just heard. We

1125
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,280
want to hear from all the passionate

1126
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,720
nursing students here in this country

1127
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,400
who are ready to inspire and help

1128
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,000
everyone they meet. And there's still

1129
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,280
time for you to enter the future of

1130
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,680
nursing contest. You just have to go to

1131
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,200
dr.com for all the details and just make

1132
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,960
sure you enter by November the 15th.

1133
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,560
That's the deadline. For everyone else,

1134
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,480
for everybody else, pay attention to

1135
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,760
this because we've got advice from

1136
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,760
someone who knows a lot because you know

1137
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,200
nurses are very insightful about

1138
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,040
prevention and they're very open to

1139
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,640
supplements. So, they believe in you

1140
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,839
being able to help yourselves. For

1141
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,040
example, what kind of preventive

1142
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,320
supplement do you believe? What's one

1143
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,240
that you typically take?

1144
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,000
>> Okay. So, I like a lot of them and your

1145
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,079
son is great, but this is one of my

1146
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,240
favorite ones. This is a probiotic.

1147
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,480
Probiotic is such an easy way to take

1148
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,920
care of your health. Very important for,

1149
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,400
you know, you know, your digestive

1150
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,240
system, your immune system. Um, and I

1151
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,320
think they're not all created equally

1152
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,000
either. Quality is really, really

1153
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,480
important. And USANA really has that

1154
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,960
covered with I think they have the the

1155
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,440
definitely the guarantee that the two

1156
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,040
highly most researched probiotic strains

1157
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,280
are in every single one of the packets.

1158
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,839
So, it's really easy, which is important

1159
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,920
for me. So, they're sugar-f free, dairy

1160
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,240
free, gluten-free, which is also very

1161
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,640
important to us as consumers, right? Um,

1162
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,800
but they also have like a mild um, sweet

1163
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,280
flavor, which I have a sweet tooth, and

1164
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,040
so that's nice. Um, and you can mix it

1165
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,359
with any, you don't have to drink this,

1166
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,200
but my kids drink it like this, but you

1167
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,320
can mix it with any cold beverage. I

1168
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,000
actually just take it straight right

1169
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
from the packet. So, it's super super

1170
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,760
simple.

1171
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,960
>> Thanks for what you do.

1172
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,599
>> Yeah, thank you for having me.

1173
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,920
>> It's honored.

1174
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,280
>> Thank you.

1175
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,720
>> Thanks to my trusted sponsor partner,

1176
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,680

thousand packs of Esana's probiotic.

1179
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,720
>> And what about the audience? They're so

1180
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,040
attentive.

1181
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,760
>> Yes.

1182
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,880
>> Should they get some?

1183
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,200
>> They absolutely should.

1184
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,680
>> You're all going home with you

1185
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,240
probiotic, too. Enjoy it, Kill Bell.

1186
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,240
We'll be right back.

1187
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,359
>> Ah, the sizzle of bacon. Could this

1188
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,680
breakfast stable put you at risk? The

1189
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,330
story you haven't heard. That's coming

1190
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,680
up on Monday.

[Music]

1192
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:33,520
[Applause]

1193
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,040
You have a stressful life, you high

1194
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,960
blood pressure, even suffer from

1195
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,960
insomnia. Well, studies show there's a

1196
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,960
new remedy for combating these health

1197
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,960
problems that might just surprise you.

1198
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,280
It's fish. No, I'm not talking about the

1199
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,680
omega-3s in your diet, but just simply

1200
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,839
watching them in an aquarium in your own

1201
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,000
home. I was so fascinated by this

1202
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,920
science that I wanted to deep dive into

1203
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,880
the research and find out the truth for

1204
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,319
myself. I had a blast doing my homework.

1205
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,599
Every evening, I actually make sure I

1206
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,599
take a moment and watch those little

1207
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,359
fish swim down that yellow brick road

1208
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,880
because studies show it can improve your

1209
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,960
mood. One study actually showed that

1210
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,079
simply watching fish can reduce your

1211
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,560
blood pressure by up to 4%. So check out

1212
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,319
Tanked on Animal Planet Friday night at

1213
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,760
900 p.m. to learn more. And remember,

1214
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:19,359
together change is happening. Our

1215
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,359
journey is just beginning.
