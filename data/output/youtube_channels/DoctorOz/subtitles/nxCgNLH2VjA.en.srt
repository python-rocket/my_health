1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:06,240
Another controversial investigation. An

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,320
uproar over coconut oil erupted when a

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,719
professor recently called it pure

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,960
poison. The video of those comments went

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,960
viral and sent shock waves around the

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,800
world. We've been following every twist

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,720
and turn and today we investigate the

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,760
most recent claim against this popular

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,330
food. Is coconut oil guilty as charged

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,480
or is there a way to use it smarter?

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,720
[Music]

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Coconut oil is being called out as one

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,800
of the worst foods you can eat.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,360
According to this Harvard professor,

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,600
this viral video created a flurry of new

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,079
headlines questioning coconut oil,

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,640
stoking outrage and even enraging a

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,040
whole country. India is now calling for

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,200
an apology. Just recently, it seemed

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,840
like coconut oil became America's health

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,239
food darling overnight. Hundreds of

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,199
YouTube videos popped up touting it for

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,280
improving your health both inside. Great

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,359
for anybody who's trying to fight heart

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,680
disease and out. Coconut oil can

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,920
actually help stimulate hair growth.

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,720
Today, health food blogs and Pinterest

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,000
still praise it for helping with

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,799
everything. Weight loss, lower blood

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,240
pressure, brain health, digestion. Heck,

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,240
it's even supposed to be good for your

32
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,320
dog. And studies have backed up the idea

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,159
that coconut oil's unique chemical

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,040
composition is beneficial to your

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,280
health. We even covered it on this show,

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,759
but recently the tide has turned on

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,759
coconut oil. Last year's negative

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,520
headlines, prompted by a science

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
advisory from the American Heart

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,159
Association, which recommended against

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,040
eating coconut oil made me want to take

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,920
another look at it. So, is coconut oil

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,439
healthy or not? Today, we're cracking

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,439
the case and telling you the truth.

45
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,640
So Shana is here and says the recent

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,320
headline sent her into a tail spin of

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
questions. When did you first start

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,680
using coconut oil? So just a couple

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,200
years ago at a women's conference,

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
someone I spoke with said that she was

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,479
using it for her hair, skin, and also

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,320
food that she cooks with. And so I said,

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,000
"Well, let me try it." So like many

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
other folks, she began. And then slowly,

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
I understand it became part of your

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
life. So Tashana kept a coconut oil

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
diary for us. Really important to

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
understand what's really going down

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,680
because like a lot of things, a little

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,200
bit you can get away with, but too much

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,200
might be an issue. Now I understand you

62
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
like hush puppies. Yes. Is that right?

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,360
Yes. All right. So, but they look good.

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
That's coconut oil in there. Yes. I'm

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,800
from the south, so we eat those with our

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,640
seafood all the time. Yes. That's right.

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,879
Well, in the south, you know, gravy is

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,319
the beverage. So, it just sneaks up on

69
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,440
you. So, tell me about these hush

70
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,800
puppies. You cook them in there. How

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,239
long you keep them in the oil? Uh, keep

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,599
them in there for about maybe 20 30

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,120
minutes. Yeah. And how much coconut oil

74
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,879
do you have to add? I use three t

75
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
tablespoons. Three tablespoons. All

76
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,080
right. So, I did the math on that since

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,480
I had your diary. All right. And it

78
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,000
turns out that comes out to about 364

79
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
calories. 33 grams of saturated fat. You

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,720
just might want to keep this in mind

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
because approximately 10 grams is sort

82
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,239
of the goal. So, not not you didn't

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,480
drink this stuff after you're done with

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,680
it, but it gets into it. Okay. Now, I by

85
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,200
I think I got to commend your cooking

86
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,280
because look at this everybody. This is

87
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,480
the shrimp and that looks really good.

88
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
But how much coconut oil did they have

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,319
to put in there to make it? So, for this

90
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,440
I put two tablespoons. All right. So,

91
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,400
the shrimp added an extra bit. So, now

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,720
you up to 677 calories with 55 grams of

93
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,560
saturated fat. Y. And then of course you

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,959
got to have dessert. And I understand

95
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,200
you're a a real wiz at these babies.

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,280
Yes. Cookies. Yes. What kind are they?

97
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,800
Uh those are coconut cookies. Yeah.

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,480
Coconut cookies and coconut oil. How

99
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,080
much coconut oil did you add to them? Uh

100
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,319
two tablespoons for those as well. All

101
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,599
right. So that's total amount for the

102
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,360
day of 850 calories, 77 gram saturated

103
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,360
fat. Guys, this is half the calories you

104
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
can get for the day. And it's, you know,

105
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,720
almost eight times what you're supposed

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,080
to get max for the day. And nothing that

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,760
you did seemed all that out of the

108
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
whack. Mhm. And that's I think one of

109
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,159
the reasons it's causing all this

110
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,440
controversy. So, we're going to learn a

111
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,519
little bit more about it. Yeah. All

112
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,680
right. So, this is really a case of, you

113
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,040
know, it's not as dangerous as people

114
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,519
think, but it could be more dangerous

115
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,959
than you think. So, it was claimed to be

116
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,560
more dangerous than lard. We have tried

117
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,480
reaching out to the professor to get her

118
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,319
explanation and did not hear back. We

119
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,680
did receive a response from one of the

120
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,680
universities she works with. They said

121
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,920
in part, "It was never our intention to

122
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
upset people." Well, she's upset people.

123
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,879
To dig a little deeper, we have two

124
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,640
people who are upset. They're experts.

125
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,640
Dr. Dr. Mark Hyman and nutritionist Maya

126
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,840
Feller. They helped build a saturated

127
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,840
fat scale. Let's reveal how these all

128
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,680
stack up. So Maya, again, it was said to

129
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,240
be worse than lard. Yeah. So you got a

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,720
scale from 0 to 100 of saturated fat.

131
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,320
Lettuce, cucumbers, you know, fruit,

132
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,000
it's all down here at zero. There's no

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,120
saturated fat in all the produce we tell

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,199
you to eat. How much fat is in saturated

135
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
fat is in lard? Okay. Well, get ready

136
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,320
for this.

137
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,320
That's very kind of you to bring real

138
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,479
lard, right? It's around 40%.

139
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,360
On scale from zero to 100, we're around

140
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,040
40%. So almost half of lard is saturated

141
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,400
fat. Exactly. Dr. Heyman, how does that

142
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,400
compare to butter? Well, butter is a

143
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,800
little more saturated fat. It's about

144
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
60% saturated fat. So, it's more than

145
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,040
lard. More than lard. And how about

146
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,680
coconut oil? Where's that? Coconut oil

147
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,400
is by numbers the worst, but it may not

148
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,720
be the worst. It's about 80% saturated

149
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,120
fat. So, coconut oil has percentage wise

150
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
twice as much than lard. Yes. Of

151
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,919
saturated fat. But it's very different

152
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,199
saturated fat. Well, hold on. So, this

153
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,639
Harvard professor who says that it's

154
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,800
worse than lard in terms of percentage

155
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,560
saturated fat was right. True. All

156
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,160
right. But is it worse for you? Is it

157
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,360
worse for you? That's a good question.

158
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,160
All right. So, my I'm looking at this

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,840
and coconut oil definitely has more fat

160
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
percentage- wise than lard. Does it make

161
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
it more dangerous than lard? So, yes,

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,479
coconut oil absolutely has more

163
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,479
saturated fat in comparison to uh lard.

164
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,479
However, not all saturated fats are

165
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,039
created equally, right? Am I going to

166
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,560
say that coconut oil is the devil? No,

167
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,680
not at all. Do I think you should put it

168
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
on every single thing that you're

169
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,759
eating? No, not at all. But headto head,

170
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,360
is it better or worse than lard?

171
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
Headto head, I would say that they're

172
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,039
different properties, right? And when

173
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,199
we're looking at how it affects the

174
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,280
body, I prefer plant-based saturated

175
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,600
fats over animal-based saturated fats.

176
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,600
So, given all things, you'd rather have

177
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,680
coconut oil than lard. So, that's okay.

178
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Just keep in mind that it's not maybe

179
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,319
better than some of the other fats you

180
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,080
might be eating like olive oil.

181
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,080
Absolutely. Dr. Heman, you disagree. Dr.

182
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,919
Heman thinks saturated fat is actually

183
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,039
about to change how it's being

184
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,479
perceived. And we've been down this road

185
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,400
before, right? We all thought

186
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,280
cholesterol was the devil in our diet.

187
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,800
No eggs, no shrimp. And when this show

188
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,160
started, that's what people were saying.

189
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
And we actually, the truth is, we never

190
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,600
really took a hard look at the evidence

191
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,280
in our dietary guidelines. And after 35

192
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
years, they did. They were like, "Oh,

193
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,560
it's not a nutritive concern anymore. Go

194
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,520
ahead and eat your whole eggs." Right?

195
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
The same thing I believe is going to

196
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,639
happen with saturated fat. And if you

197
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,600
look, the American Heart Association

198
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,880
doesn't always get it right. They told

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,240
us to eat a low-fat diet. They told us

200
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,280
to eat margarine. They told us to eat

201
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,680
lots of carbs. Bad advice. And in this

202
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,080
review, they only looked at four studies

203
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,680
from the 50s and 60s which were really

204
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,440
flawed. And they've ignored dozens of

205
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,319
other studies since that exonerate

206
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,280
saturated fat. In and one in particular

207
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,800
talked about coconut oil and olive oil

208
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
and butter. And they looked in a

209
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,479
randomized control trial, the most

210
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,639
rigorous trial design, they found that

211
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,080
olive oil and coconut oil were about the

212
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,759
same in their effect on the bad

213
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,520
cholesterol,

214
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,039
whereas butter was a little worse. But

215
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,720
what was interesting was it actually

216
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,479
helped the good cholesterol get even

217
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,080
better. So the overall profile from the

218
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,039
coconut was better even though it has

219
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,759
80% saturated fat. Why? Because the

220
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,440
kinds of saturated fats in different

221
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,880
foods are different. Animals have

222
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,479
different this has different than this

223
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,599
has different than this. and they have

224
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,080
different properties in the body because

225
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
food is information. So these tend to

226
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,120
actually do a little better with us. I

227
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,560
also think we're going to look at this

228
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,960
differently in five years when the new

229
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,479
dietary guidelines come out because the

230
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
National Academy of Science has realized

231
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,120
there's something fishy up that no one's

232
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,039
really looked at the evidence. They go

233
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,479
saturated fat's bad. Everybody believes

234
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,919
it. Why should we bother looking at it?

235
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,199
Well, they're going to look at in the

236
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,720
next round and we're going to find, I

237
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
think, that saturated fat's going to go

238
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,960
the way of dietary cholesterol. But one

239
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,039
caveat here. You cannot eat a diet high

240
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,520
in saturated fat or any other fat if

241
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,960
you're eating a diet full of starch and

242
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,800
sugar, which Americans do. They eat

243
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,280
about a half a pound of sugar and about

244
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,000
3/4 of a pound of flour every day. It's

245
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,599
that deadly combination I call sweet fat

246
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,520
that will kill you. So Tashana, for

247
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,759
example, was okay with the coconut oil

248
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,800
shrimp. Listen, Tashana, but shrimp's

249
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,080
good. Yeah, shrimp's good. But she

250
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,240
wasn't okay with your fat on the

251
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,080
cholesterol. That's But the the hush

252
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,160
puppies and the cookies, those are a

253
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,840
problem. Dangerous. Yeah. Yep. Put it on

254
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,360
your broccoli.

255
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,879
So, my final thoughts. It was initially

256
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,000
thought coconut oil was heart healthy.

257
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,520
You know why? Because there are low

258
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,879
rates of heart disease in places like

259
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,560
Polynesia where they eat lots of

260
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,399
coconuts. But if you look at it closer,

261
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,680
they ate coconut meat. It's not quite

262
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
the same as the oil because it has a

263
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,200
little fiber in it. And their diet was

264
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,159
very low in other saturated fats. They

265
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,080
probably didn't eat some of the other

266
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,760
refined sugars that Dr. Heyman was

267
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,000
complaining about. But these days, many

268
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,519
of you are using coconut oil on top of

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,360
other fats. It ought to be used, I

270
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
think, as a replacement for other

271
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
saturated fats like butter or lard or

272
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,200
anything else. I would not replace

273
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
unsaturated fats yet, like olive oil.

274
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,399
Although I appreciate that we're not as

275
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
hard set on that as we like to be. So,

276
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,680
the big question is, how much should you

277
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,440
be using? The surprising amount both of

278
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,680
these experts say you can use. Stay

279
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
tuned for coconut oil and its protocol.

280
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,480
It is time to help clear up your coconut

281
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,320
confusion with a coconut oil protocol to

282
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
help you get the most benefits. My med

283
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,519
team and I reached out to many experts

284
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
all over the medical community in

285
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,959
nutrition and heart health and those

286
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,760
researching the latest data to come up

287
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,839
with a smarter way to use coconut oil.

288
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,959
The first of course is how much do you

289
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,839
use? Nutritionist Mayafella is back. You

290
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,560
know Tasha earlier was putting a total

291
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,760
of seven teaspoons of coconut oil in her

292
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,720
cooking and she made some beautiful

293
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,080
stuff. So how much can you use? So I

294
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,920
always say limit yourself to a maximum

295
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,760
of one tablespoon a day. If you want to

296
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,080
spread it out over the course of the day

297
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,560
and you're having three meals, go for no

298
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,680
more than one teaspoon per meal. You're

299
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,200
not going to put it on starch and

300
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,360
sugars? Absolutely not. We're not going

301
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,640
to put it on any refined grains or, you

302
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,680
know, things like that. We're also not

303
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
going to put it on things that have

304
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,399
added sugars. So, we're not looking at

305
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,320
pancakes, cakes, cookies, none of that

306
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,600
with your coconut oil. That you're not

307
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,040
getting that extra bounce for that. You

308
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,480
don't get extra credit. You don't pass

309
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,680
go. Definitely not. All right. Thanks,

310
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,959
Maya. Next up, what are you going to

311
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,800
look for in the label so you get the

312
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,000
right kind of material? Dr. Diamond, how

313
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,519
do we pay attention? Because there's so

314
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,959
many types of coconut oil out there now.

315
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,240
Yes, true. A lot of the old studies that

316
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,560
showed coconut oil was bad were on

317
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,720
hydrogenated, highly processed, heat

318
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,640
treated coconut oil. You want the raw.

319
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,160
You want the virgin stuff, right? You

320
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,839
don't want refined stuff. All right.

321
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,399
Next up, how do you actually eat coconut

322
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,600
oil smarter? There's a secret ingredient

323
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,279
that might actually help manage the

324
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,800
cholesterol issues and could be a

325
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,480
one-two punch with the coconut oil, and

326
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,480
it is fiber. Just like those

327
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
heart-healthy Polynesians, right? When

328
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,800
you eat coconut oil paired with fiber,

329
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,800
it might not make your bad cholesterol

330
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,160
go up as much. And from my perspective,

331
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
that's a win-win all around. Yeah.

332
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
Because it's one of the few ways to

333
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,240
helping your good cholesterol. Okay.

334
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,000
Give me some examples. You got grains.

335
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,760
Okay. So, this is one of my f favorite.

336
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,920
I love wheat berries. Love, love, love

337
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,360
them. I make it like salads. I do all

338
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
the time. They're getting popular wheat

339
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,000
berries. They're everywhere. You can

340
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,600
really find them all over the place. And

341
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,800
they're not weak. No, they're not. I

342
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,040
know. That's the great thing. It's kind

343
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,480
of like wild rice. Yeah, exactly. Why do

344
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,920
they name things the wrong thing? I have

345
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,200
no idea. Just to confuse us. Why I call

346
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
it wheat berry but it's not wheat.

347
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,560
Doesn't that make you mad? Well, who's

348
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,839
running the branding for wheat berries?

349
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,040
I know. And it's an ancient grain.

350
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,160
That's also why I love it. You know,

351
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,680
full of vitamins and minerals, fiber,

352
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,600
phytonutrients. I love it. Barley.

353
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
Barley and quinoa. Right. So, these are

354
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,320
some of the whole grains that I like to

355
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,920
pair the coconut oil. One of my favorite

356
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,680
little stories. When we first started

357
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,279
the show, I would talk about quinoa.

358
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,120
Nobody could find it in stores because

359
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
they didn't know how to spell it. You

360
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,480
all know how to spell quinoa now. Right.

361
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,120
Exactly. I hope so. There is progress.

362
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,040
10 years of spelling. All right. So you

363
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
have grains here and you have legumes on

364
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
the other side, right? And so I chose

365
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,560
legumes that are easy to find like

366
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,640
garbanzo, kidney, and lentil. Also ones

367
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,800
that are easy on the pallet and lentils

368
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,560
cook super quickly. And kidney and

369
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,839
garbanzo, if you go for the dry ones, it

370
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,920
takes a little bit longer, but well

371
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,360
worth the wait. And just you're putting

372
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,640
other hat on as nutritionist. If you if

373
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
you soak them, it gets rid of the gas

374
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,279
problems afterwards. Absolutely. So

375
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,640
that's what I you know, you can actually

376
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,640
even soak it with a little bit of

377
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,680
kamboo, which is seaweed, helps even

378
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,519
better. I like that, Maya. Nicely done.

379
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,399
everything. You're going to find this

380
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,600
coconut protocol. It's all new. It's on

381
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,279
dr.com. Share it with your friends. Do

382
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,639
it right. Thank you for watching. Don't
