00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,880
Today, for years, we've been told to eat

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,400
less carbs and more protein. New

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,400
research shows that those steaks,

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,000
burgers, and bacon could be the secret

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,960
culprit behind your biggest health

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,360
issue, meat belly dilemma. When you eat

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,840
this kind of diet, bad bacteria can

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,320
overpopulate. Plus, shocking information

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,400
that you never knew about seafood. 90%

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,439
of our seafood is important, and the FDA

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,330
only takes a look at 3% or less. Coming

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,920
up next.

13
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:36,600
[Music]

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,600
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:41,390
[Music]

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,530
I love you

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,530
[Music]

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:56,320
[Applause]

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:59,199
guys. Paleo, keto, whole 30. No matter

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,440
which diet tribe you belong to, one

21
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,400
thing is clear. We live in a new low

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,280
carb culture that has everyone thinking

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,360
meat. Meat. But new research shows that

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,520
those steaks, burgers, and the bacon may

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,119
be changing our gut and could be the

26
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,400
secret culprit behind your biggest

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,560
health issues, including what you dread

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,280
most, constipation. So, today we're

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,320
asking, could a proteinpacked diet lead

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
to a meat belly dilemma? My go-to

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,680
tester, Renatha, is here with a group of

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,680
meat lovers right now who have concerns.

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,479
So, Renatha, who'd you bring with you?

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,520
What are the concerns? So, these ladies

35
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,560
are some hardcore meat lovers, okay?

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,560
They pack on the protein. They are in

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,040
the meat, meat, meat, and meat and meat,

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,479
more meat, right? But they do have some

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,560
concerns, okay? So, I mean, this is who

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,920
these ladies are. Some meat. Don't look

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,600
at me like that. You go first. Don't

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
look at me like that. I know you all

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,680
have complaints.

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,280
Well, I pretty much eat meat for every

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,759
meal. So, I think if I'd have I think I

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,719
probably do have meat belly, so just

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,720
worried about how I can fix things.

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,399
Carol, what's bothering you? If I if I

49
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,160
said you look good, but maybe you don't

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,560
feel so good. What's bothering your

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,800
belly? Um, I feel that since the low

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
carb diet that I've been on, I eat a lot

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,000
of protein and meat, but I also feel

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,360
that um I'm stopped up and I'm I I'm I

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,120
just need like I need a movement or join

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,959
the movement. Well stated. You join the

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,239
movement with a movement. I appreciate

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,920
it very much. That's a big complaint

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,360
with folks who eat meat. All right. So,

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,959
Susan, what are your concerns? Well,

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,560
I've been on a low carb, high protein

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,879
diet for a really long time, and I've

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
done really well with it, but I just

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
want to know what meat belly is. What's

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,080
the dilemma? All right, so this caught

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,560
my attention and there's actually a lot

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,840
to say about it. So, I brought in a guru

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
that I trust a lot in this. She's also

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,560
my big expert on gut, Dr. Butch Roster.

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,760
So, Butch, you just heard, how are you?

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,120
So, Carol stopped up. Bernat avoided the

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,319
issue completely because I know there

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,680
probably things she's worried about.

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,360
Zena's got her, you know, concerns about

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,040
the pendulum swinging too far. So, there

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
was a study recently which actually

77
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,800
prompted me to do this show which looked

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
at the effect of meat on the bacteria in

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,920
our gut. Yeah. A study from Harvard, by

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,440
the way, ladies and gentlemen, his alma

81
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,800
mada, but it's from Harvard. Give my

82
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,000
hand. The Yellies have to give you the

83
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,440
prompt, right? That's where he went.

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,760
That's where he went. All right. Now, so

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,000
here's the deal with this. We had

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,920
prominent universities uh Harvard and

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,319
the University of California that took

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,480
two groups and they had equal number of

89
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,440
males and females but they did something

90
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,799
different. They fed them over five days

91
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,840
a plant-based diet and one group a

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:48,319
meat-based diet. And the meatbased diet

93
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,280
was beef, pork, egg yolks, and other

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,879
fatty foods. And guess what happened in

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,439
five days? Five days of that diet

96
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,480
change, the people in the meat-based

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,519
group, their gut bacteria composition

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,480
and populations changed. And as you

99
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,840
know, we want to keep a healthy gut

100
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,200
balance in our GI tract for good health.

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,400
Actually, we have a little animation

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,159
your shoulders everybody because I want

103
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,680
you all to appreciate how gut bacteria

104
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,120
affects your health, especially when

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,639
it's the meat that's changing it. So,

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
baseline, these are all the little

107
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,360
bacteria. Exactly. And we want a diverse

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,400
population. It's all about a balance of

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,040
power between the good bacteria and the

110
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,600
bad bacteria. But when you eat this kind

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,400
of diet, oh, the little nasty bad

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,720
bacteria can really overpop populate.

113
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,720
And these are nasty little critters. And

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,400
let's just say how nasty are they? You

115
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,800
would not invite them to Thanksgiving

116
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,199
dinner if you had a bunch of these Y.

117
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,560
But they come along uninvited at what do

118
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,479
they release? Exly. And and the big

119
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,800
thing is that they release something

120
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,680
called TMAO.

121
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,880
Now, nobody try should try to remember

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,960
this. I remember it by saying tomato.

123
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,440
Okay, that's how I remember it. But the

124
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,360
big thing that you must remember about

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,680
this dangerous agent is that it can

126
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,600
cause chronic autoimmune diseases. And

127
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,520
that's that's the bottom line. All

128
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,199
right. So, Dr. Roser has some foods that

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,280
can lower the inflammation that could be

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
caused by meat so you can avoid the meat

131
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,199
belly dilemma. So, what do you want us

132
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,639
to add to our diets? Let's go to the

133
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,120
first one, Dr. because pistachios of all

134
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,320
things pistachios why because they can

135
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:32,800
decrease TMA or tomato and but sometimes

136
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,960
you know you know Dr. Oz you have to

137
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,600
trick yourself let me go ahead and show

138
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,800
people how I can actually trick myself

139
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
into getting those nutrients you don't

140
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
mind at dawn this morning I got this

141
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,919
alarming picture put it up there please

142
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,240
if you don't mind Scott that's what I

143
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,840
got this is Dr. roster getting up in the

144
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,880
morning. I don't think he was showing

145
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,880
off either. That's what he was having

146
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,600
for breakfast. Yeah, exactly. But look

147
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,479
at what we do with salmon. You can grind

148
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,199
up the pistachios and make a crusting

149
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,560
agent and then put a little cayenne

150
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,479
pepper. You know, I'm a southerner, so

151
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
you know, I'm going to go on you and

152
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,240
wrap that up into something that is

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,160
absolutely delicious. It looks

154
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,840
fantastic. And it is. Oh, it is. And

155
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,400
let's go to the next one. Now, this

156
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,800
one, Brussels sprouts of all things. The

157
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,720
only use I had for Brussels sprouts, Dr.

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,080
Oz, was in the fifth grade hitting the

159
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,680
boy upside the head that took my

160
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,639
girlfriend. Yeah, I'm still injured by

161
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,680
that. But my wife recently taught me how

162
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,319
you roast these. You roast it and you

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,960
can even had have bacon. Yeah, guys,

164
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,560
that's right. We We're not declaring a

165
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,520
war on meat at all. Okay. But you can't

166
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,440
go berserk with meat and especially just

167
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,479
give a little bacon here and then roast

168
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,639
it and and you got yourself a good meal.

169
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,800
And the last but not least, I got to

170
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,160
have something sweet. Do you know that

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,160
grapes and berries actually have um a a

172
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,520
special ingredient that helps to

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,680
decrease TMAO or tomato? Now, what I do,

174
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,080
Dr. Oz, you can have them frozen, but I

175
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,479
have to put a little um low carb whipped

176
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,520
cream, if there is such a thing, on top.

177
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,120
All right.

178
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,639
So, Renata, he's speaking your language

179
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,840
for you. What do you guys think over

180
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,240
there? You know, he's speaking my

181
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,120
language, Dr. Eyes. Okay, first of all,

182
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,039
mind blown. Okay, my mind is blown. And

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,960
I mean, yes, the the frozen grapes. He's

184
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,160
because I do have a sweet tooth. You

185
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,160
know me. Okay, I do have a sweet tooth.

186
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,840
And um using the pistachios as crust for

187
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,840
salmon. You know, we got to trick

188
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,759
ourselves. Yeah. You know, you know, I

189
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,240
love my fried stuff, so I got to trick

190
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,240
myself into u making it a healthier

191
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,479
option. Ran, we call that stealthy

192
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,800
healthy eating. You got trick yourself

193
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,639
to do the right thing. There's one other

194
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
dilemma that got brought up earlier,

195
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,039
which is constipation. You know, the

196
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,199
need to move. It's not always being

197
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,560
satisfied. First of all, why do so many

198
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,240
folks who are big meat eaters have

199
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,160
issues with that? Well, and this is one

200
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,319
of the most frequent complaints I have

201
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,639
with patients that they have a difficult

202
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,919
time going. And the big thing is that

203
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,080
the meat has a high fatty content. And

204
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,000
here's the process. And this is going

205
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,240
from the root to the tuda as we say down

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,160
south for all you folk who are familiar.

207
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,639
All right. To the root to the tutor.

208
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,560
You eat this heavy fatty food. That

209
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
slows down your transit time. How long

210
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,639
it takes to go through the intestine.

211
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,560
That allows more absorption of water.

212
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,919
That makes your bowel movement what?

213
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,080
Hard. that gives you constipation and

214
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,240
Houston we have a problem when that

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,000
happens. So that's what it's all about.

216
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
So you know once again we're not we

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,919
don't have a war on meat. Let's look at

218
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,839
these three items here and this is a way

219
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,399
to find out well help you in the

220
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,640
decision making here when you look at

221
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,200
this steak over here that I'm pointing

222
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,440
to. Now notice Dr. Oz there's not a lot

223
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,240
of white streaking there. No. Okay.

224
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,720
That's low fat content. All right. Now

225
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,720
come over and look at this T-bone. Maybe

226
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,600
it looks good. Oh Lord, help us. And

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,720
this is the one we really like, right?

228
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,200
And so the the big thing here is follow

229
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,000
this roster's rule. If you got to have

230
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,560
one, you got to give me four days of the

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,160
good meats. If you got to have one, you

232
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,279
got to give me four. Which always a

233
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,519
pleasure, my friend. All right. Got it.

234
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,680
Up next, a meat industry insider is

235
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,839
signing the alarm on an FDA loophole

236
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,440
that's allowing antibiotics to still

237
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
sneak into your meat. Now, are these

238
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,000
antibiotics also messing with your gut?

239
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,000
We're going to find out when we return.

240
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,959
All new, the new ecigarette you don't

241
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,640
even know your kids are using. You have

242
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,160
kids congregating and they start to

243
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,080
vape. It looks like a flash drive. It's

244
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,440
not. And then the kids can tuck it away

245
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,120
when they're done. Kids don't think that

246
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
they're doing anything but vaping water.

247
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,200
Young people in particular are really

248
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,610
really susceptible. All new Oz. That's

249
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,690
coming up

250
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,869
[Music]

251
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,869
[Applause]

252
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,360
tomorrow. It's the change consumers like

253
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,839
you and the medical community have been

254
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,920
asking for to have less antibiotics in

255
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,080
meat. And the FDA listened, having

256
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,920
banned the use of antibiotics in healthy

257
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,240
animals aimed at speeding up their

258
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,000
growth. But meat industry insiders,

259
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,920
they're sounding the alarm on a major

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
loophole in this policy that still

261
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,200
allows antibiotics to sneak into our

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,040
meat. Today, a rancher speaks out.

263
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,959
Nichollet Han Nyman is the author of

264
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,800
Defending Beef and one of the most

265
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,040
influential ranchers around. She's

266
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,839
actually at Nimman Ranch. So, how are

267
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,399
antibiotics still ending up in our beef?

268
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,399
Well, in our meat generally, what FDA

269
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,120
did was it said you can't use

270
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,519
antibiotics to promote growth, but it

271
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,360
didn't say you can't use them in a non-

272
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,200
therapeutic way, which is where you feed

273
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,959
the whole herd or you put it into the

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
water and so all of the chickens or all

275
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,040
of the pigs are getting the antibiotics.

276
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,600
So, they're still allowing it for

277
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,360
disease prevention. That's a non-

278
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
therapeutic use. And from a public

279
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,440
health perspective and from a concern

280
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,880
about healthfulness on meat, you know,

281
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,279
the antibiotic resistant bacteria being

282
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,839
on meat, it has the same effect. So,

283
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,880
it's a huge loophole in the FDA rule.

284
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
The big question is how do the

285
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,880
antibiotics mess up your gut flora,

286
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,160
right? Or do they at all? And I was

287
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,600
going to say something. You know, we've

288
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,200
been just fielding questions about

289
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,279
constipation, other problems like that.

290
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,120
The good news is that doesn't seem to be

291
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,279
an impact from the antibiotics that the

292
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,480
animals are given in your gut. It's not

293
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,160
messing up your gut like if you were

294
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,760
taking the antibiotics. There are strict

295
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,040
rules that require animals to be weaned

296
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,800
from antibiotics well before the

297
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
slaughter. So there those antibiotics

298
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,079
aren't ending up in your meat. But there

299
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,480
are other concerns like the animal

300
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,680
passing along antibi resistant bacteria

301
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,800
which is what you're bringing up. And if

302
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,160
I don't mind, if you don't mind, let me

303
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,839
take one second to get everyone on the

304
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,839
same page. Take a closer look at this

305
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,320
loophole because it's vitally important.

306
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,000
We understand because it's the hypocrisy

307
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,680
about all this that really bothers me.

308
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,399
Right? So let's talk about what happened

309
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,279
before the ban. Ranchers used

310
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,279
antibiotics not just for treating

311
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,279
diseases, right? But but for making the

312
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,680
animals grow faster, right? Because why?

313
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,079
Animals get ready faster for the

314
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
slaughter. And time is money. So you

315
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,639
know, if you were a rancher, you'd

316
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,680
probably do this too, right? But

317
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,560
recently, this came to an end. The FDA

318
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,519
banned antibiotics used just for growth

319
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,639
promotion. Why? Because

320
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,560
antibiotics and their use became so

321
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,920
prevalent that we started suffering a

322
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,639
national health crisis of antibiotic

323
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,639
resistance. Have you all heard about it,

324
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,880
right? Antibiotic resistance. You know,

325
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,399
it's because in part we believe so many

326
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,519
animals are getting antibiotics for

327
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,360
reasons that don't involve infections.

328
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,440
So the FDA limited the use of the drugs

329
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,040
by saying you can't use it to fatten up

330
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,600
your pig, but you can use it to treat

331
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,959
your pig if they get sick. Right? Pig's

332
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,480
not feeling well. We don't want the

333
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,399
animal to die. Antibiotics are

334
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
appropriately used for humans. They can

335
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,560
be appropriately used for animals, for

336
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,959
your pets. Everyone's happy. But this is

337
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,480
a very big butt. The FDA left a

338
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,560
loophole. Ended up becoming a big

339
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,440
loophole. They allow antibiotics to be

340
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,320
put in the feed of animals as a means

341
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,560
for disease prevention. Now that means

342
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,040
even if the animal's not sick, it can be

343
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,600
given preventatively. And the problem is

344
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,040
it leaves a back door open to use it as

345
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,440
a growth promoter again. So Nichollet,

346
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,040
this is a theoretical issue and you know

347
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,079
I host a television show but I'm not a

348
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,000
farmer, not a rancher. You are. So how

349
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,079
commonly are meat growers using this

350
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,399
loophole in your opinion? Well, I think

351
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,639
it's probably quite common. So, really

352
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,320
the problem with this rule as it's

353
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,560
written right now is that it's just

354
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,240
about the intent of the farmer. So,

355
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,920
someone can just say, "I'm not using it

356
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
for that purpose. I'm using it for this

357
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,760
purpose." And not change any of their

358
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,720
practices. And and most animals probably

359
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,000
do get antibiotics, right? Um in the

360
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,600
conventional industry, yes. in up in a

361
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,279
few years ago there was a really uh

362
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,680
thorough analysis done by the union of

363
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,920
concern scientist and they found that

364
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,760
100% of pigs were getting it in the

365
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,440
finishing stage and about that much in

366
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,880
the poultry as well. These are in the

367
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,399
conventional industry something that's

368
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,399
not organic and uh it's the usage has

369
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,440
continued to grow over the years. So

370
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,639
it's it's a huge it's a huge issue. You

371
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,959
don't believe we should get rid of all

372
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,440
antibiotics I am told no I think that's

373
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,120
a really important distinction. There's

374
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,600
therapeutic use. It's just like you just

375
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,959
said, when you have a sick human, you

376
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,959
can give them antibiotics and that's

377
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,320
appropriate. Similarly, if you have a

378
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,639
sick individual pig or chicken or cattle

379
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,199
animal, it's appropriate to treat them.

380
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,279
We had a mature mother cow that was 7

381
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,000
years old on our farm a few years ago.

382
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,680
She had never been sick and she had uh

383
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,800
as the fall weather came and it was

384
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
getting cooler nights, she got

385
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,160
pneumonia. We treated her with

386
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,760
antibiotics in that case and she fully

387
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,680
recovered and she didn't have to suffer

388
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,800
a prolonged illness. She's still with

389
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,480
our

390
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,160
her that is the right way to use

391
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,399
antibiotics. I should point out there's

392
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,480
a true paradox. You're a rancher and a

393
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,600
vegetarian. Yes, you guys can work that

394
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,839
out later on. It's unusual. So So listen

395
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,120
on this show, we believe transparency is

396
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,360
critical when it comes to your meat. So,

397
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,880
Renatha's group of meat lovers is going

398
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
to get a chance to ask questions to a

399
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,920
real life rancher. If that's okay, come

400
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,720
on over. The first thing I want to ask

401
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,040
Renath actually is no antibiotic meat,

402
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,880
right? Is that important to you? I mean,

403
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,959
yeah. I mean, it's important. I mean,

404
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,120
you know, antibiotics was used for meat

405
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,480
growth, but and you know, in the long

406
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,480
run, if you're going to the grocery

407
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,720
store, you get more meat product for

408
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,519
your buck. But, you know, my concern is

409
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,880
antibiotic resistance, you know. So, you

410
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,639
know, it's the right concern to have,

411
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,480
right? Absolutely. Doctors like me are

412
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,160
primarily worried about that as well. I

413
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,600
actually wouldn't mind it so much. I

414
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
don't want farmers to suffer, ranchers

415
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,760
to have a difficult time. I just don't

416
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,360
want to create health problems for the

417
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,360
rest of us. You have a question for

418
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,399
Nichollet. Yeah. I mean, what can I do

419
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,399
to ensure that I'm buying the best meat

420
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,560
possible, the healthiest meat possible?

421
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah. Well, if you're in a grocery store

422
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
and you want to get the best possible

423
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
meat, the organic label is a good label.

424
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,240
It does say that the antibiotics haven't

425
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,240
been used. also tells you more about

426
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,079
good animal husbandry and good um land

427
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,920
stewardship. And I also um there's

428
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,079
certainly an antibiotic free label you

429
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,079
can look for. But for me, I always try

430
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,399
to um find that the animal was raised on

431
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,639
pasture. So grass is kind of the watch

432
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,800
word. If the animal was on grass, it

433
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,440
probably had a healthier life and the

434
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,320
food that it produces, whether it's milk

435
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,040
or meat or eggs, is more nutritious

436
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,639
food. Thank you very much. Thank you.

437
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,639
Chad Nichollet's book. It's called

438
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,320
Defending Beef. You and I are joining a

439
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,260
cow show after the show. We'll be We'll

440
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,759
be right back.

441
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,279
[Applause]

442
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
Everything you need to know about how to

443
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,639
buy and cook the perfect fish every

444
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,720
time. I'm letting you into the

445
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,560
magician's circle. Find out all the

446
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,440
secrets coming up next. Look how flaky

447
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,440
this is. Oh my

448
00:16:51,079 --> 00:17:00,000
goodness. Look carefully. This or this?

449
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,519
Fresh or frozen? When it comes to buying

450
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,279
fish for your family, it's hard to tell

451
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,799
which is best. So, today we're

452
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,039
connecting you with a fish industry

453
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,880
whistleblower and a food investigator to

454
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,360
reveal shocking inside information that

455
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,720
you never knew about seafood. Paul

456
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,919
Greenberg is here as one of the biggest

457
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,919
authorities in fish regulation. A sports

458
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,559
fisherman and ecologist who's making

459
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,240
waves lately tracking the fish weed from

460
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
sea to store. And Chef Danny Boom is

461
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,120
here.

462
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,120
It's got the consumer red flags that you

463
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,480
have not heard before. Paul, let's start

464
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,080
off with the the first thing. You know,

465
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,919
you were around fish all the time. Is it

466
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,520
okay to buy in a supermarket where it's

467
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,360
cheaper? Well, first of all, there's

468
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,000
something fishy going on with our fish

469
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,600
supply. I mean, that mean so many puns.

470
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,080
He's casting a wide net on these. Got

471
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,520
you on the line. But, um, so 90% of our

472
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,840
seafood is imported actually in this

473
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,720
country and the FDA only takes a look at

474
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,240
3% or less. Wow. So, huge huge

475
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,799
disconnect between what we know and what

476
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,400
we being sold out there. Um,

477
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,240
supermarkets can be a good place to get

478
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,679
your seafood, but you need an extra

479
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,120
layer of knowledge and protection. And

480
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,720
we're going to give you a few ideas, I

481
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
think, that will help you get along with

482
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
that. You did an interesting experiment.

483
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,679
Yeah. Uh, for all of us to benefit from

484
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,440
you. For breakfast, lunch, and dinner

485
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,200
for a year, you ate fish. I did.

486
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,120
Was it worth it? What was the outcome?

487
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,760
Well, it was a little again fishy, but

488
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,200
um, no. So, you think I'm kidding.

489
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,520
Everything he says is one fish. Sorry.

490
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,160
Sorry. Sorry. Um well, first off, my

491
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,400
omega-3 levels were quite high. Um they

492
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,039
were over 10%. Um most Americans are

493
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,360
about half that. And also my mercury

494
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,360
went up up to about five five parts per

495
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,960
million. So it was super super high.

496
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,919
What I've kind of come to realize is

497
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,160
that two portions of sustainably raised

498
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,000
or sustainably caught seafood is really

499
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,600
great. And the rest of your diet, make

500
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,840
it vegan. So a little bit of fish, a

501
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,160
little bit of shellfish, mostly vegan,

502
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,080
you'll be good. So the the best consumer

503
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,000
is educated consumer. So, if it's okay,

504
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,760
you guys are going to school us, right?

505
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,880
Thank you for getting my puns. Yeah.

506
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,600
We're going to start with the question.

507
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,760
I I I uh opened the segment with fresh

508
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,559
or frozen. What do you guys think is

509
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,960
better?

510
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,320
Fresh. Fresh. You're sure? Yes. Why are

511
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,520
you sure? I feel it has more benefits to

512
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,880
it and it's not really sure. You're not

513
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,400
sure, but it sounds like it's better,

514
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,320
right? You're pretty sure. Healthier.

515
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,720
Healthier. Fresh. But frozen is much

516
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,480
easier more convenient. Yeah, frozen is

517
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
more That's the problem, right? Frozen's

518
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,840
so much more convenient, but darn it,

519
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,200
fresh is better for us. Or is it? So,

520
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,280
the first thing you need to know about

521
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,760
buying fish is which one is actually

522
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,679
better, frozen or fresh? Paul, walk us

523
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,600
through this. Well, here's the thing.

524
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,320
Frozen is not bad at all. And you know,

525
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,559
it used to be frozen seafood was gross,

526
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,480
right? It was um sort of rubbery

527
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,640
texture. That was because they froze

528
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,960
things at really um not low enough

529
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,480
temperatures, froze it too slowly. Now

530
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,000
they have these super fast freezing

531
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,000
methods that keep it really really

532
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,840
frozen, really cold. Um and if you

533
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,600
defrost it in your refrigerator

534
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,280
overnight, you will end up with a really

535
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,120
delicious piece of fish. Now, aren't you

536
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
happy you came to the show today? All

537
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,960
right, next thing we want to know is you

538
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,559
want to

539
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,039
look for the freshest fish. And you want

540
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,240
to look therefore for clear eyes, not

541
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,640
cloudy eyes. Danny, why is that

542
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,559
important? Okay, first thing is a cloudy

543
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,880
eye. Looks dead in. Look at this fish

544
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,120
here. Look, they got the the fresh and

545
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,080
then sort of like a five day to six day

546
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,720
old fish. Okay, so the eye is cloudy.

547
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,880
But then there's the old wives sayings.

548
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,559
Okay, so let's look at this fish here.

549
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,799
This is how we know a fish is fresh

550
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,480
because we have a clear eye, beautiful

551
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,159
scales. But then we would open up the

552
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,720
fish. This is where we will insert the

553
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:40,080
knife. We come down. Okay. And then what

554
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,360
we do is we open up from the gills. Now

555
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,880
the gills are here. Okay. Now you most

556
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,200
people are going to look in here and

557
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,840
this is the gill. Look how beautiful

558
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,760
pink deep red that is. Can you all see

559
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,679
that? You see on both sides there. Now

560
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,520
everybody knows the expression green

561
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,360
behind the gills, right? That means when

562
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,200
you're sick. Well, you don't want green

563
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,440
behind the gills when it's a fresh fish.

564
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
Okay? You want deep, beautiful pink and

565
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,679
red colors. Okay? Then we look at the

566
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,200
look at the actual flesh of the fish as

567
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,520
well. Okay? When you're dealing with

568
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,120
like white fish or like snapper or even

569
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,240
salmon, you're looking at that bright

570
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,400
color every time. Okay? So, the brighter

571
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,640
the fish, the deeper the colors. And

572
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,320
again, like with snapper, like with

573
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
white fish, it should be opaque. It

574
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,640
should be a bright white. Okay? And with

575
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,640
salmon, it should be like a good deep

576
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,760
red. So, get back to these eyes. I read

577
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,520
an article recently because I'm

578
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,120
fascinated by telling about your fishes

579
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,559
being good or bad for you. And there

580
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,200
were there's a tweet that showed that

581
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,600
markets are putting fake googly eyes on

582
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,320
fish to distract the shoppers. This is a

583
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,320
real tweet, right? It's unbelievable,

584
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,840
but that's how you know attractive it

585
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,799
is. It was working for that market, they

586
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,000
wouldn't be doing it. All right. Next

587
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,200
thing you need to know about buying fish

588
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,039
is you want to buy your shrimp and your

589
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
scallops in a way that that where you're

590
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,840
sure they have not been treated with a

591
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,799
hidden chemical or if you get the hidden

592
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,320
chemical, at least know that you're

593
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,799
getting it. So, what is this hidden

594
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,679
chemical, Paul? So, it's sodium

595
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,159
tripolyphosphate. It's actually a salt.

596
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,480
Um, and this is a chemical that uh,

597
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,960
seafood makers use to plump up their

598
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,400
catch. Um, it actually causes seafood to

599
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,080
absorb a lot of water, but in the

600
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
process, it's also giving us quite a

601
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,400
sodium load. So, these 5 ounces of

602
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,159
shrimp here, that's like 60% of the

603
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,799
recommended daily intake of sodium. So,

604
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,720
that's a huge load. So, the problem is

605
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,799
when you cook this, in addition, this

606
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,440
stuff will shrink down. Shrinkage will

607
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,200
occur and uh, you'll end up with lot

608
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,280
less shrimp on your plate. So, the S is

609
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,360
sodium salt, correct? Yeah. And if you

610
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,400
don't have it, it's only 16% of the salt

611
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,320
that you're allowed for the day.

612
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Correct. So that's, you know, four-fold

613
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,400
increase from adding this. That's right.

614
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,320
All right. So, in fairness, this this

615
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,159
salt stuff, STP, is not dangerous for

616
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,760
your health, right? Small amounts. It's

617
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,280
the price. It's the price. It's the

618
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,720
flavor. Yeah. Right. And maybe the

619
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,080
texture. They all fit together. So, let

620
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,679
me bring Zena in here because Zena's got

621
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,440
lots of questions. This woman has more

622
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,400
questions than anyone I know, I think.

623
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,320
All right. So,

624
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,320
your family apparently can't get enough

625
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,960
seafood. So, how worried about chemicals

626
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,480
like this in the in the store? Well,

627
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,880
first off, I'm just concerned that

628
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,520
there's chemicals being pumped into my

629
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,559
seafood anyway. Um, but now that I'm

630
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,880
hearing it's not bad for you, my other

631
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,320
concern is just being ripped off at the

632
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,840
at the supermarket. Absolutely.

633
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
Absolutely. So, how can you tell, Chef

634
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,200
Danny? Well, basically, as we said,

635
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,039
we're talking about the STP is plumping

636
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
it out. Okay. So, when we talk about

637
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,840
certain things, you're looking at

638
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,840
differentiations. When you're looking at

639
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,159
the scolops right here, we have dry and

640
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,000
we have wet. The wet is in a milky

641
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,039
brine. Okay, that's your actually that's

642
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,799
your STP right there. Okay, so those

643
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,240
they look off already to me. I don't

644
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,919
actually find that appetizing, but when

645
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,440
you look at the dry, look at them. They

646
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,520
got this beautiful peaches and cream

647
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,440
color. How about shrimp? Because I I

648
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,720
suspect families like ours are eating a

649
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,760
lot of frozen shrimp. It's the classic

650
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,760
thing you get. So, how do you know if

651
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,679
they've added STP, which appears to be

652
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,440
pretty common? This is the problem.

653
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,440
Okay, it's not always on the packet.

654
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,440
Okay, we we're labeling in this country

655
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,919
is terrible. Okay, so when we look at

656
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,720
this uh bag of shrimp here, it just says

657
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,400
shrimp on it. Okay, that's fantastic. So

658
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,919
then when the other bag of frozen

659
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,240
shrimp, it says easy peel, but it

660
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,520
doesn't say anything else. So what I'm

661
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,080
going to tell you right now is when it

662
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,679
says easy, nothing's easy in the food

663
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,159
world, people. We have to prepare, we

664
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,919
have to make food, okay? And and you

665
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,240
have to be within that in your kitchen

666
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,919
culture. When you look at easy peel,

667
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,520
what that means is basically it's been

668
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,240
pumped. It's been sat in the brine of

669
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,960
the STPPP. So, basically, the flesh is

670
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,960
basically bulked up and it's too big for

671
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,720
the shell. So, when you actually defrost

672
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,880
it and when you get to cooking, pops. It

673
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,919
pops. Okay, that's what makes it easy.

674
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,000
You know what? I'm not going to be

675
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,320
eating these. So, you can have these. If

676
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,840
you feel bad buying the cheaper option

677
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,600
when it comes to your fish, we're

678
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,360
absolving your guil your guilt because

679
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,640
it'll break two fish rules that you

680
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,640
always thought were true. Stick around.

681
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,840
The rates for pancreatic cancer are

682
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,600
actually going up. It's one of the

683
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,679
deadliest forms of cancer and has

684
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,159
claimed the lives of legends. The top

685
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,880
three ways to cut down your risk. Plus,

686
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,640
surprising ancestry DNA results. The man

687
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,919
that raised me was not my biological

688
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,140
father. All new Oz. That's coming up on

689
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:13,519
Wednesday.

690
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,519
[Music]

691
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,000
If you have ever had a wave of guilt

692
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,080
hook at you when you're fish shopping

693
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,520
and you choose the cheaper option, well,

694
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,600
fear not because they were giving you

695
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,120
permission to break two rules, big fish

696
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,200
rules that you thought were always true.

697
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,960
So, I've told Susan buys fish for her

698
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,360
family. So, describe everybody what it

699
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,159
feels like when the the tide rises, the

700
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,000
tide of guilt. Well, I feel really

701
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,240
guilty when I buy frozen fish, like I'm

702
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,919
a cheap mom, like I'm cheaping out on my

703
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,320
kids. So I don't know, you know, I

704
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,559
always think I should get the wild

705
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,320
versus the farm raised. Yeah, there are

706
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,600
budget questions we always have. Now,

707
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,559
you saw that earlier when we started

708
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
challenging folks about their

709
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,600
assumptions. So, you know, something

710
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,720
makes sense for your family, but you

711
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,840
think the other thing is better for your

712
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,840
family. So, let's break through this

713
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,520
right now. Pay attention because Chef

714
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,960
Danny Boom and our fish whistleblower

715
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,120
and author of the Omega Principle Paul

716
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,159
Greenberg says, "Farmed fish can be as

717
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,520
good as wild." I hope that sets your

718
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,400
heart at ease because this is a big

719
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,000
issue because it's a big price

720
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,360
difference. Paul, why? Well, I mean,

721
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,760
first of all, I'm a dad and I do all the

722
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,240
cooking in my house. So, I also look for

723
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,400
cheap things. So, um, but farmed seafood

724
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,240
used to have a bad rap and there's all

725
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,159
sorts of instances, a lot of antibiotics

726
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,760
being used, uh, poor sighting of farms

727
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,279
and so forth, but we're really starting

728
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,600
to see this new generation of

729
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,440
aquaculture entrepreneurs who are really

730
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,520
trying to do things as sort of

731
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,360
sustainably as any organic farmer. My

732
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,559
mind has changed completely. 10 years

733
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,159
ago when we started the show, I would

734
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,840
have actively told you not to buy farmed

735
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,520
fish because I'd been to farmed fish

736
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,159
areas. It just didn't seem sanitary. It

737
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,240
seemed sloppy, uh, low budget. It's not

738
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,080
how it is right now. They want because

739
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,919
obviously they heard the consumer. The

740
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,679
consumer had concerns and so the farmers

741
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,640
listened. And so then we're looking at

742
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,400
fish like arctic char, catfish, big

743
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,400
hardy fish now that are being produced

744
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,679
on mass. There is a better and safer

745
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,799
way. So, these are all fish that you

746
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,760
guys are beginning to hear more and more

747
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,240
about because they're they're

748
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,520
affordable. They're farm-raised. I think

749
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,960
from a health perspective, they're just

750
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,919
fine. And I want to applaud guys who

751
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,360
made a big difference. They've changed

752
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,279
my mind on this. All right, Paul, let's

753
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,720
go to you. You love the ocean. You're

754
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,320
committed to sustainability. You say

755
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,320
there's an important rule when it comes

756
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,320
to buying fish. And I'm going to say

757
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,559
this is not about nationalism. Paul says

758
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,279
we got to buy American or from countries

759
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,200
with good environmental policies. Why?

760
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,039
Well, this country has gone through a

761
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,520
tremendous revolution in our fisheries

762
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,200
management. And so we should award award

763
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,039
American fisheries for really behaving

764
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,039
really well. And it's not just America.

765
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,960
It's not just a nationalist thing. We

766
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,559
have Australia. We have New Zealand,

767
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,679
Iceland, Norway. These are countries

768
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,440
that are really following the rules of

769
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,840
science and are really producing good

770
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,240
good healthy fish for us. Iceland, huh?

771
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,720
Well, why not? Listen, we got this very

772
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,399
popular new podcast, the Oz podcast that

773
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,000
uh Paul's a guest on. We do these deeper

774
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,440
dives into these kinds of topics and you

775
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,120
tell a great story. So, you know, check

776
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,720
it out. It's free. you'll learn

777
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,000
something. Our next chef, Danny Boom,

778
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,919
says when buying fish, it's okay to go

779
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,120
for smaller fish. Maybe it's preferable

780
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,960
to go for smaller fish. It really is.

781
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,360
Well, the first thing is they're tiny

782
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,120
but mighty. Okay, they've got tons of

783
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,799
amiggas in this. And the great thing is

784
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,320
you don't have to buy it pickled or in a

785
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,399
jar. You can actually buy them fresh.

786
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,200
They're fantastic for barbecuing, okay,

787
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,720
or on the grill. And uh seriously, also

788
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,000
a little bit of olive oil, a little salt

789
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,360
and pepper, and they just do it all.

790
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,120
They have all the flavor. Pack the

791
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,399
flavor, pack the nutrients. I I tend to

792
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,919
eat this kind of fish as much as

793
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,440
possible. I know it has a strong taste

794
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,360
for things like herring, I turn into a

795
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,880
cat. I can't stop myself. But let me

796
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,399
explain what Danny means and why you

797
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
might want to change what you're eating.

798
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,840
So besides the taste, because I do think

799
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,440
it tastes better. Researchers say that

800
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,799
small fish, right? They travel around

801
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,559
and they eat all the different things,

802
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,760
the algae and all, but guess what? They

803
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,039
often have a little bit of mercury in

804
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,880
them because the algae they're eating

805
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,039
and the other seaweed and stuff, they

806
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,480
get contaminated from coal fire plants

807
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,600
and other things in the water, right? So

808
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,120
these little fish have a little bit of

809
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,840
mercury in them. Guess what happens? A

810
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,919
bigger fish comes along, trumps them up,

811
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,679
right? The predator now has all the

812
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,440
mercury that was in the many fish that

813
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,960
it ate. It doesn't stop there because

814
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,120
what happens to the bigger fish? They

815
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,799
get eaten by the even bigger fish,

816
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,320
right? And the process continues and so

817
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,960
on and so forth. And you purchase the

818
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,679
big fish, right? You put it on your

819
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,440
plate and guess what? It now has the

820
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,120
largest amount of mercury of all the

821
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,039
fish. And that can be harmful. I had

822
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,240
high mercury levels. That's why I'm so

823
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,440
tuned to this. so high that I got a

824
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,360
letter from the state department of

825
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,559
health. Wow. Saying, "Hey, what's wrong

826
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,480
with you?" And it was because I was

827
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,679
eating so much fish. And you know, Paul,

828
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,799
we learned earlier did went an

829
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,320
experiment. He was eating fish all the

830
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,600
time. He got higher levels. It doesn't

831
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,360
have to be that way. Eat the smaller

832
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,720
fish, you can avoid the problems. So,

833
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,720
now that you know what kind of fish to

834
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,720
buy, plus it's less expensive when you

835
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,399
buy the small fish. Chef Danny Boom is

836
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
giving away restaurant secrets you can

837
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,159
use at home to cook the tastiest fish of

838
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,159
your life. Oh, you're going to like

839
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,159
this.

840
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,320
[Music]

841
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,320
I love getting to talk with you on my

842
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,480
show every single day. But when the

843
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,799
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

844
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,880
is not over. I still have a lot that I

845
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,679
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

846
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,320
Oz podcast on Apple Podcast or wherever

847
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,320
you get your

848
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,000
[Applause]

849
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,240
podcast. I want you eating fish at least

850
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,919
twice a week, but a lot of you tell me

851
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,679
it's hard to prepare. I get it. So, I

852
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,240
asked Chef Danny to spill the restaurant

853
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,840
secrets to perfect fish. Is there a

854
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,279
special method to cooking fish? There's

855
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,200
I think I think what most people get is

856
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,279
is the timing and the heat. I think we

857
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,799
either cook overcook it or we either

858
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,240
basically really put it at such a high

859
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,520
temperature that we dry out. And that's

860
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,520
the biggest complaints when we talk

861
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,840
about fish. So, there's three major ways

862
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,320
of cooking fish, okay? There's baking,

863
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,440
steaming, and poaching. Okay? The first

864
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,520
thing we're going to start with is

865
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,440
baking. So, we got a baking tray. This

866
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,440
is the the basically the the quick and

867
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,559
easy. And most types of fish are very

868
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,320
hardy that we would do this with. So,

869
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,360
we're using cod today. So, what I'm

870
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,799
going to do is I'm going to go straight

871
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,919
in with a little lemon on the bottom of

872
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,520
the of some foil. Okay. A little salt.

873
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,840
Okay. Now, why I'm putting the salt on

874
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,000
the base and the pepper is because I'm

875
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,120
not going to be turning my fish. So, I'm

876
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,120
going to be baking it. So, I'm going to

877
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,360
be surrounding it in uh at the oven.

878
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,159
It's going to be about 400°. And the

879
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,200
magic number when you're cooking fish is

880
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,480
between 7 and 8 minutes. And your fish

881
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,080
will be perfect. When I order fish at a

882
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,840
restaurant, I tell them to undercook it.

883
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,120
Not sushi. Just undercook it a little

884
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,960
bit. And that's gets you to the same

885
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,080
place. Be so happy. We're going to place

886
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,120
the cod on. Okay. On here like so. So,

887
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,440
we place one fill it on, two fill it on.

888
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,640
We're going to take some lemon again.

889
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,600
Give it some squeezes. Okay. The the

890
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,159
lemon really brings it out. And this is

891
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,320
what it looks like after 7 minutes. Not

892
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,240
even eight. Just like this. Now, look at

893
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,679
the difference here, Doc. Because what

894
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,440
you got here is this is it looks kind of

895
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,039
flaky, right? It looks beautiful. And

896
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,880
when you actually put the fork through

897
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,960
it, okay, look how it just just

898
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,320
literally falls away. Look at that.

899
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,720
Isn't that beautiful? Exactly what you

900
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,559
want. Okay, so we'll put that back in

901
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,600
the oven cuz I'm sure somebody in the

902
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,960
audience is going to want to taste that.

903
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,960
Yes, we've been feeding the audience all

904
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,039
day. Yeah, of course you do. Right.

905
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,039
Okay, so that's our bake. So remember

906
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,000
when you're baking, nice hot oven to

907
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:11,120
start off with. Put it in at 400° and

908
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,480
remember what's the magic number? Seven

909
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,480
eight. Seven to eight minutes.

910
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Brilliant.

911
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,840
So that's baking. Then we're going to go

912
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,240
to the real healthy way. Okay. Steaming.

913
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,240
Everybody loves steaming vegetables.

914
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,919
When it comes to fish, it's even better

915
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,679
because basically you're absolutely

916
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,000
sealing in all the nutrients and you're

917
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,600
not losing anything for overheating.

918
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,600
Okay. So when we actually look at this,

919
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,279
we have a what we call a bamarie. We

920
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,039
have the steamer basket on the top.

921
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,159
That's boiling water. And the great

922
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,840
thing is when you're cooking, you could

923
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,440
be doing your vegetables on the bottom

924
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,200
and then you could be cooking your your

925
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,799
fish on the top. Okay. What I'm going to

926
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,559
show you here is a little trick. We've

927
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,200
got some salmon. It's called the dip

928
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,200
dab. Okay. Dab. Dip dab. Okay. Oily

929
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,720
fishike salmon. What we would do is we

930
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,640
would just basically give it a a touch

931
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,919
of water and then dab it. That just

932
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,360
takes the the over secretion of oil off.

933
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,120
Okay. Because I don't want that white

934
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,120
film popping out. Then I'm going to

935
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,039
place it in. But before I place it in,

936
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,960
I've got to think about air rotation,

937
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,960
okay? Because I don't want it just all

938
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,799
cooked in one spot. I want it cooked all

939
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,240
over the round. So, I'm going to take a

940
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,679
little rosemary. And this is very

941
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,559
controversial in the cooking world to

942
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,159
put uh rosemary in with salmon. You guys

943
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,600
fight over this? Oh, yeah, we do. But

944
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,279
what we do is put the rosemary or a

945
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,200
chopstick or some lemons and some limes

946
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,039
at the base and it'll actually help the

947
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,640
steam rotate around the fish. I love the

948
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,640
smell of the rosemary. Oh my goodness.

949
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,760
So, we place that in there. Don't forget

950
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,240
the salt. Don't forget the lemon because

951
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,159
that brings the flavor party to the

952
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,840
kitchen. Okay, I'm letting you into the

953
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,840
magician's circle. I like this. All

954
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,320
right. Okay, finally poaching. You've

955
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,080
been waiting all day. Yeah. So, look at

956
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,440
what we got here is we've got some water

957
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,279
that's boiling away. It's simmering

958
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,279
nicely. Okay. Now, what we can do here,

959
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,200
if you do that, do the reveal. Now, I've

960
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,799
taken um some halibet just for the

961
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,039
halibet.

962
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,240
He'll be here all week. Thank you. Try

963
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,240
the eel. Try the eel.

964
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,600
the corn beef and the yield. Oh my

965
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,880
goodness. So, what we've got here, we've

966
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,880
soaked it in milk and it's going to

967
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
tenderize it down. Okay. So, we're going

968
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,280
to take the two fillets here. I'm going

969
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,800
to place them into the poaching solution

970
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,520
here and I'm going to leave them in

971
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,440
there for how long, folks? 7 to 8

972
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,800
minutes. That's beautiful. It's already

973
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,720
boiling. Then, we're going to add in

974
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,520
some a little paprika. Okay. A little c

975
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,440
uh turmeric, maybe some mustard seeds.

976
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,040
Put them in there. Made a mess, but we

977
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,720
pop it in there. And basically they

978
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,440
breathe in all those flavors. Touch a

979
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,720
white wine and you have got delicious

980
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,679
poached fish in how long? 7 to 8

981
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,399
minutes. You got it. All

982
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:42,159
right. Who wants to taste here? Let's

983
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,480
see what you got here. Now this is

984
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,960
poached. Now I've never given poached to

985
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:52,320
an audience. I don't like it usually.

986
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,200
Very good. You can miss me. Chef Dan can

987
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,639
miss me. Head on over to dr.com for the

one sheet. One of the best ways to

989
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,359
prepare your fish, but you already know

990
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,839
it's 78 minutes. Don't forget that one.

991
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,839
We'll be right back.

992
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,839
Are you freezing your food all wrong?

993
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,320
Today, we're revealing the mistakes you

994
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,800
may be making in there and the best and

995
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,320
safest way to store your food. Ooh, ice

996
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,780
cream. Step away from the ice cream,

997
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,399
Mara.

998

[Music]

999
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,000
Not to sound cold, but you might be

1000
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,520
making big mistakes when it comes to

1001
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,040
freezing your food and not even know it.

1002
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,560
Investigative journalist and resident

1003
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,839
foodie Mariampo is here. The original

1004
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,599
science has started taking a look at the

1005
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,040
food in our freezer, which most of us

1006
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,400
have ignored. I certainly have most of

1007
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,079
my adult life. Why is it so important?

1008
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,839
You know, the freezer is one of the most

1009
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,079
important appliances in your house

1010
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,839
because it's the key to quick, easy,

1011
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,280
convenient meals. It saves you time in

1012
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,359
so many different ways. You can freeze

1013
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,960
your leftovers. You can cook food ahead

1014
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,960
of time and freeze it so you have ready

1015
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,800
to go meals. You can grocery shop less

1016
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,079
often. You go once a week. You put that

1017
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,720
food in the freezer till you're ready to

1018
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,640
cook it. And it can help you save money

1019
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,480
because buying in bulk is often cheaper.

1020
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,760
So again, you stock up. You put it in

1021
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,599
the freezer, defrost it when you're

1022
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,880
ready to cook it. All right. So Marc

1023
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,000
says the first mistake we're making is

1024
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,920
we're taking the temperature of our

1025
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,800
freezer. Tada. Drum roll. Too high. This

1026
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,000
seems impossible to me. 32° is freezing.

1027
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,920
So, why is that not the right

1028
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,760
temperature? Well, most people think

1029
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,400
exactly what you think. So, we did a

1030
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,480
poll. We asked our viewers at dr oz.com,

1031
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,160
"What temperature is your freezer set

1032
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,720
at?" And here's what they told us. They

1033
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,040
told us that they were setting it at 0°.

1034
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,119
Some said they were setting it at 32°.

1035
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,240
About 41% of people said, "What you

1036
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,520
think?" And 28% said they have no idea,

1037
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,000
which is exactly what I would have said,

1038
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,760
right? I have no clue. But the reason

1039
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,599
that it's too high is because this is

1040
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,359
the temperature that water freezes at.

1041
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,599
But when it comes to freezing your food,

1042
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,000
it's too high. The magic number for

1043
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,480
freezing your food is zero. You want it

1044
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,520
set at 0°. All right. Second big thing

1045
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,640
is we overfill the freezer. I don't know

1046
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,079
anyone who has enough room in their

1047
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,680
freezer. Yeah. And ours is a big

1048
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,520
freezer. It's still packed all the time.

1049
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,800
Yeah. My mom has two. She does. So,

1050
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,720
what's the problem with that? Yeah. So,

1051
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,920
a full freezer is actually a really good

1052
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,760
thing because it helps keep the

1053
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,680
temperature nice and consistent, but you

1054
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,359
don't want to overfill it because then

1055
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,280
you're preventing air circulation and

1056
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,040
you're blocking vents. There are air

1057
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,400
vents way back in the back there. Let me

1058
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,480
show Did you Who Who knew there were

1059
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,760
vents back there? Be honest. Good. All

1060
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,680
right. Like three people. All right.

1061
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,960
Now, come come look at this. Right. I

1062
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,320
had to look for a while. I didn't even

1063
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,680
know where the ones are at home. I found

1064
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,119
it here, though. I take this out. There

1065
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,280
it is. See that little thing back there

1066
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,880
hiding back there? That vent. If that

1067
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,960
gets blocked off, your freezer is not

1068
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,480
working. Yeah. And the other thing is is

1069
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,760
location is really important, right?

1070
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,760
Just like real estate, location,

1071
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,520
location, location. The coldest part of

1072
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,280
your freezer is here in the middle. The

1073
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,200
place that gets the least amount of cold

1074
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,839
air is the door. So, you want to put

1075
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,680
your ice cream on the door and then you

1076
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,440
put your meat, which you do want to be

1077
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,320
really rock solid. Put that in the

1078
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,920
middle of the freezer. So, valuables

1079
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,000
everything you can use. Now, the freezer

1080
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,359
may be a big mistake, but it's not the

1081
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,680
only mistake you're making. Not wrapping

1082
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,359
your food tightly enough is a big, big

1083
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,079
concern. We sent two members of our bike

1084
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,839
club, Adriana and

1085
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:08,079
Denise, out with a homework assignment.

1086
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,520
We gave them an ice pack bag, right, and

1087
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,800
a cooler. And we asked them to raid

1088
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,160
their freezers. Here they are at home

1089
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,760
doing exactly what we asked them to do.

1090
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,640
And they had to bring them bring stuff

1091
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,240
in that they had to admit we're not

1092
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,960
wrapped tightly enough. And we're going

1093
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,640
to show you and everybody at home what

1094
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,320
we're all doing wrong and why it

1095
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,240
matters. All right. So, let's go in that

1096
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,000
first bag there. What's Adriana guilty

1097
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,280
of and what is the penalty? All right.

1098
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,960
So, let's take a look at what Adriiana's

1099
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,320
done. So, Adriana has waffles. A lot of

1100
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,760
us buy these. We love these pre-made

1101
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,200
waffles. And what she's done is she

1102
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,040
hasn't eaten all of them at once, right?

1103
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,359
When she puts them back in, she just

1104
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,800
kind of loosely wraps this up. And what

1105
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,560
happens, you get all of this

1106
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,240
crystallization forming because it's not

1107
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,839
tight enough. If you just put it in a

1108
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,280
zipper bag, you'll solve that problem.

1109
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,880
Adriana, should you be eating waffles?

1110
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,160
That's the question really. Well, I I

1111
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,240
knew you were going to say that. I watch

1112
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,240
your show all the time, Dr. Oz, and I

1113
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,880
they're they're multigrain or whole

1114
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,920
wheat. I make sure. But, you know, but

1115
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,079
at the same time at the same time, I

1116
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,920
only eat like one every month, and

1117
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,599
that's why I got that way. So, you know,

1118
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,079
so I can't be blamed too much. I'm

1119
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,880
honored you brought it in. All right.

1120
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,800
So, I I you know, I look in here and I

1121
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,000
notice this. Mara, please walk us

1122
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,320
through what you've noticed. Yes. So,

1123
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,320
this container is not filled enough. And

1124
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,560
because there's so much air in there,

1125
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,640
you can see that this has gotten all

1126
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,960
crystallized. So, what we call freezer

1127
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,960
burn, it's actually food drying out. You

1128
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,720
know, you see those burned patches on

1129
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,400
chicken or what have you and you see the

1130
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,720
ice crystals around it. these ice

1131
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,400
crystals. This is water that has come

1132
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,359
out of the product making it a lot more

1133
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,920
dry. So, it's just not going to taste

1134
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,200
that yummy. Speaking of chicken, sorry,

1135
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,240
we found this at your house also. I

1136
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,520
think you're bringing it in again. Same

1137
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,119
thing. So, not doesn't matter that it's

1138
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,640
frozen. It doesn't matter. But this is a

1139
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,839
bit of a problem because you know here

1140
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,200
it's obvious you got to fill the whole

1141
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,160
thing up. But you just put this in a

1142
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,599
baggie, which I thought you were

1143
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,839
supposed to do, but I guess you left too

1144
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,359
much air. Yeah. And I have a great hack

1145
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,640
for you. You're going to love this. This

1146
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,480
You want to hack on this one? Let's go.

1147
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,000
Let's do it. Yes, please. Come on over

1148
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,760
here. So, this is really amazing. I

1149
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,359
learned this in reporting the story out.

1150
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,680
This is going to change my life. Okay.

1151
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,280
So, so vacuum sealers can be expensive.

1152
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,960
They're upwards of $100. Do you guys

1153
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,160
have vacuum sealers at home? No, I don't

1154
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,200
know. Yeah, I don't either. I don't know

1155
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,560
who has one of these cuz that's not

1156
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,000
going to happen. And they're also big,

1157
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,839
right? They take up a lot of space. But

1158
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,160
there is a genius hack that will

1159
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,839
simulate the the vacuum seal. So, can

1160
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,480
you help me with this? So, we have this

1161
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,320
chicken. It's in a zipper baggie. It's

1162
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,920
open. We're going to put it in a bowl of

1163
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,960
water. The water is room temperature,

1164
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,119
not boiling, not hot. As you push the

1165
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,760
bag down, it's naturally through some

1166
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,119
magic of physics going to push the air

1167
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,720
out. And then, can you just seal that up

1168
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,920
for me? It's displacing the air. That is

1169
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,200
so smart. Like you would if you were

1170
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,280
swimming. I figured you would know

1171
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,560
these. Yes. This is so good. Uh, and

1172
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,480
then when you pull it out, you can see

1173
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,760
that it's pretty much vacuum sealed. You

1174
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,720
see that? A vacuum sealing for the price

1175
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,320
of a baggie. That's so cool. And now

1176
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,680
your food is safe. No freezer burn. All

1177
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,520
right, ladies. Thank you very much for

1178
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,359
playing with us today. Up next, the

1179
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,720
biggest frozen food mistake that you are

1180
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,880
making. It's going to surprise you. Stay

1181
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,880
with us.

1182
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,839
For 32 years, this 12-year-old's death

1183
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,079
has remained a mystery until now. Using

1184
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,079
genealogy and cutting edge DNA

1185
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,280
technology to create her suspected

1186
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:20,240
killer's face. That's coming up

1187
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,240
tomorrow.
