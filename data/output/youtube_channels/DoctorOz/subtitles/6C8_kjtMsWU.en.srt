00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,040
Today, the twisted love triangle that

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,480
led to the murder of a Marine's wife.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,280
This is Aaron, a shy small town girl

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,679
from Tennessee. Described as the animal

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,160
whisperer by family and friends, she was

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,119
gentle with a big heart and kind blue

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,160
eyes. She loved horses. Ear first met

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,080
John at a neighborhood barn. At only 16,

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,039
John asked her parents' permission to

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,599
take her on her very first date. After

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,520
graduation, he enlisted in the service,

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,280
and she would become a young Marine's

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,440
wife. But Aaron's fairy tale romance

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,719
would soon become riddled with secrets.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,800
Secrets that would end in her

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,879
disappearance in California's largest

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,360
desert. Take a

18
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:50,800
look. 142 mi east of Los Angeles, the

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,239
last stop on Highway 62 is military base

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,399
29 Palms. It's where 19-year-old Aaron

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,199
and her Marine husband John Corwin

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,640
settled after

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,960
eloping. The newlyweds rented an

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,879
apartment in a complex just like this

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,360
and became fast friends with their next

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,439
door neighbors Nicole and Chris. The

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,080
couple spent endless hours together.

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,159
According to Aaron's mom, sometimes they

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,000
would be up, you know, the couples would

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,040
be up the majority of the night and then

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,880
they make breakfast together. And then

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,320
Aaron got some wonderful news. she was

33
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,400
pregnant. She proudly announced it on

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,799
Facebook, which made it all the more

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
devastating, her mom said when she

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,720
miscarried. Part of me wanted to go out

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,759
there, but I also didn't want to

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,119
overstep my bounds. You know, they

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,880
needed that time to work together.

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,040
But Aaron thought John wasn't

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,840
sympathetic enough and started to

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,000
withdraw from him. To help with her

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,799
depression, Aaron spent a lot of time

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,600
here, a rescue horse ranch located near

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,200
the military base. She often rode horses

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,439
with her new friends Nicole and Chris.

47
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,759
But the owner of the ranch noticed that

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,799
Aaron and Chris were getting extremely

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,119
close. And she was right. Aaron and

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,520
Chris were having a romantic affair.

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,480
Ultimately, the affair was exposed. And

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,560
shockingly, John forgave his wife and

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,319
Chris. John decided he was going to work

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
through the marriage and work through

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,879
this.

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,520
And then some good news. Aaron found out

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,280
she was pregnant again. Aaron told John

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,319
that she was going to wait and tell her

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,400
mom in person. So on the morning of June

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,959
28th, 2014, Aaron came here, the Joshua

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,599
Tree National Park. She told John she

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,280
was scouting places to bring her mother.

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,599
and the man she was having an affair

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,640
with, Chris, was supposed to be at the

65
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,040
same park that day on a hunting trip.

66
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,360
Later, Chris came home, but Aaron never

67
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,840
did. The police had two suspects, her

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,840
husband, John, and her boyfriend,

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,879
Chris. Bestselling true crime journalist

70
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,879
and author of Secrets of a Marine's

71
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,560
Wife, Shana Hogan, is here. She spent

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,400
years in the front lines of this story,

73
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,080
interviewing Aaron's family or friends,

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,159
pouring over court records. She knows

75
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,840
this story inside out. Shann, thank you

76
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,239
for being here. Thank you for having me.

77
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
Give me a snapshot in the two men in

78
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,760
Aaron's life. Let's start with her

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,080
husband, John. What kind of a person was

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,319
he? Describe him to us. Yeah, John was a

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,640
really quiet, reserved guy. He didn't

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,640
really express his emotions. And Aaron

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,239
was obviously the um horse whisperer

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,480
type girl where she connected more with

85
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,920
horses than she did with people. So that

86
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,200
really bonded them and brought them

87
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,519
together. Um you know a year he he had

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,840
early aspirations of joining the Marines

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,720
and about a year after he joined the

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,400
Marines Aaron joined him in 29 Palms and

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,440
I don't think she was prepared really

92
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,319
for how military life really hardened

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,959
him. Um they faced financial struggles

94
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,560
in the beginning and um of course the

95
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,040
biggest wedge that drove them apart was

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,360
when she had her miscarriage. Yeah. And

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,200
he wasn't there for her I guess. um he

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,760
just wasn't able to really express the

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,760
same level of grief that she was and

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,519
that kind of drew them apart. So, let's

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,599
go back to that love trial again. The

102
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,680
other part of it is Chris with whom

103
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,639
Aaron had an affair. So, how was the

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,479
affair exposed? Yes. Um well, Nicole, uh

105
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,400
Chris's wife started to get very

106
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,720
suspicious of the time that Chris was

107
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,520
spending with his next door neighbor.

108
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,520
And so, um, one night she took the

109
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
memory card from his cell phone and put

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
it into her computer and was able to see

111
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,680
all these messages that Chris had kept

112
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,919
hidden from her. Um, and everyone knew

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
sadly except for John. And then one

114
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,080
night, um, they were all getting

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,639
together for a cookout and Nicole,

116
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,680
Chris's wife, confronted John and told

117
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,400
them about the affair and a a big blowup

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,520
fight ensued. Um, and it ended with

119
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,120
Nicole chasing after Aaron, saying, "If

120
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,759
you ever have anything to do with my

121
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
husband again, I'll kill you myself."

122
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,560
So, after the affair, I guess,

123
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,160
supposedly ended, what was the state of

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,240
each of the marriage? Were they able to

125
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
get back together again? Chris and

126
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,960
Nicole were um Chris was about to be

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,520
honorably discharged from the Marines.

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,240
And so, he told Nicole he wanted to work

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,919
it out. He went through counseling and

130
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,120
um they were set to return back to

131
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,120
Anchorage, Alaska, where he was going to

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,560
uh go back to school and she would raise

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,840
their daughter. Um at the same time next

134
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,199
door, John had forgiven Aaron. Um they

135
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,320
decided that they were going to work

136
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,880
through it. Um and they were seemed

137
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,000
pretty happy. Um and then Aaron found

138
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,919
out she was pregnant again. And that uh

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,919
was something that John was very happy

140
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,680
about. He called his dad and said,

141
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,759
"You're going to be a grandpa." And

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,479
Aaron decided to wait one week to tell

143
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,960
her mom in person. So, let's go to the

144
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,400
day that Aaron disappeared. What was she

145
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,440
doing in the desert that day? Why had

146
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,199
she gone out there? Aaron had told John

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
that she was leaving. She was going to

148
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,520
Joshua Tree National Park to scout out

149
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,240
scenic locations to take her mom when

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,800
during that upcoming visit. Um, at the

151
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,880
same time, coincidentally, supposedly,

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,039
um, Chris was heading out to that same

153
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,360
park, Joshua Tree National Park, for a

154
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,759
coyote hunting trip with his downstairs

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,479
neighbor. But the odd thing about it was

156
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,720
once he had got to the desert, um, his

157
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,319
neighbor tried to call him several times

158
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
and Chris had turned his phone into

159
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,039
airplane mode. Uh, he texted, he spent

160
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,759
like three hours looking for Chris and

161
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,440
that night Chris came home and Aaron

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,280
never did. So, the plot thickens. Yes.

163
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,199
Up next, Aaron's mom, Laura, is going to

164
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,880
join us. Plus, a bombshell police

165
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,880
interview with Aaron's best friend from

166
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,720
home. Reveal something that no one else

167
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,919
knew about what happened that day in the

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,080
desert. Stay with us. I love you, Mom.

169
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,000
These were the last four words Laura

170
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,400
Havlin heard from her daughter before

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,639
she received the phone call. A phone

172
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,720
call no parent should ever have to get.

173
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,960
her 19-year-old daughter, Aaron, our

174
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,360
Marine's wife, had gone missing in a

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,599
desert in California after supposedly

176
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,240
scouting places to bring her mom on an

177
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,880
upcoming visit. And she would soon learn

178
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,599
it was a secret affair that led to her

179
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,360
daughter's murder. Now, Laura joins us

180
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,120
via Zoom. Laura, I know this is hard to

181
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
talk about and thank you for being here.

182
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,960
Aaron was not only a Marine's wife, she

183
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,880
was the daughter you fell so much in

184
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,520
love with that you decided to adopt her

185
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,400
after taking her in as a foster child.

186
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,880
What kind of person was she?

187
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:34,360
Aaron was um very shy and

188
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,680
um she

189
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,440
she even as a baby if someone came up to

190
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,000
talk to her and she didn't know them

191
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,720
she'd kind of give them a drop dead

192
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,360
look. But she was an animal whisperer

193
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,479
and animals could pull her out of her

194
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,400
little reserved self. So, how did you

195
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,000
learn about Aaron's disappearance and

196
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
what was going through your head when

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,879
you found out?

198
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,240
Um, Aaron's husband, John, called us

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,199
about 11:00 that Sunday morning, the

200
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,000
29th of June, and he had asked me if I

201
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,599
had heard from Aaron. I'm like, no, you

202
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,919
know, not. We had talked on Friday. Um,

203
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,879
I had texted her on Saturday and she did

204
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,680
not respond, which was kind of strange

205
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,800
because we texted in, you know, at least

206
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,759
daily, um, and talked on the phone quite

207
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,199
a bit. Uh, then he told me that she was

208
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,919
missing and I'm like, what do you mean

209
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,919
she's missing? And then he told me that,

210
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,680
you know, she had gone out to the desert

211
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,680
to look for places for us to um, take

212
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,640
pictures and stuff when I got there and

213
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,279
she never came home.

214
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,000
That's it's sad. I know it's uh it's

215
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,160
even to talk about it now is painful.

216
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,560
When when you found out about Aaron

217
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,959
having an affair, you thought it was

218
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,800
extremely out of character for her. What

219
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,480
do you think led her to that point? And

220
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,440
how do you think it was connected, if at

221
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,080
all, to her disappearance? I still have

222
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,839
a hard time wrapping my mind around that

223
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,600
because that's just out of character for

224
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,279
her. But I just felt like, you know, she

225
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,480
was going through depression. And I felt

226
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,040
like maybe John didn't know what to do

227
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,320
to help her through that. And

228
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,120
honestly, you know, having lost two

229
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,399
daughters, my husband and I certainly

230
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,760
did not grieve the same way. and being

231
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:31,160
19 years old, 19 and 20 years old, I

232
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:35,120
think it

233
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:38,240
just somehow someway they just could not

234
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,160
be there for each other the way each

235
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
other

236
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,680
needed. And so I feel like

237
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,880
um I feel

238
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,279
like you know she was she found someone

239
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,959
that was going to comfort that comforted

240
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,440
her her and quote unquote said that he

241
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,080
understood

242
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,080
her and

243
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,000
um and I just feel

244
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,800
like he used that as a

245
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,519
manipulation to

246
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,600
um gradually pulled her towards him. So,

247
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,200
at this

248
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,040
point, you're at home. You you're on the

249
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
phone. You've heard this. You're dealing

250
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,399
with two big issues. Your daughter's

251
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,240
missing in the knowledge she had an

252
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,959
affair. The police have two lead

253
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,560
suspects. Aaron's husband, John, who

254
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
you've just spoken to on the phone, who

255
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,320
took a whole day to report his pregnant

256
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,640
wife was missing. And we have Chris, the

257
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,480
man she had an affair with. when the man

258
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,480
you say pulled Aaron, your daughter,

259
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,839
towards him, who also went to the very

260
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,680
same park the day of Aaron's

261
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,640
disappearance.

262
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,760
Yes. Did you have any strong sentiments

263
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:57,079
about either one of them at that point?

264
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:00,200
Um, I never suspected

265
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:03,120
John. I didn't know

266
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,560
Chris, you know, so I didn't have any

267
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,560
way of knowing one way or another.

268
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,079
Um, I feel

269
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,800
like when they found her vehicle without

270
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,240
her near it or in

271
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,720
it, that's when I knew that something

272
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,120
had happened to her.

273
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,440
Laura, thank you very much for sharing

274
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
something that's so raw to you. I

275
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,399
appreciate it.

276
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,519
So, let me show all of you a police

277
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,440
interview with Aaron's best friend from

278
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,320
home. Her name is Jesse. He revealed a

279
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,680
secret that would lead police to their

280
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,800
suspect. It is recounted here in the

281
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,040
podcast, Case Closed.

282
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,839
Jesse told the police the affair between

283
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,839
Aaron and Chris had never ended. Aaron

284
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,760
believed she was pregnant with Chris's

285
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,360
baby. When Aaron found out she was

286
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,959
pregnant, did she did she think it was

287
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,959
Chris's or did she think it might be

288
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,160
John's? cuz she was pretty sure. She was

289
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,800
like 90% sure it was crazy. And she told

290
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,240
Chris right away. I know she told him

291
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
because they were at one point talking

292
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,720
about

293
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,600
Chris knew about the baby and not only

294
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,680
that, Aaron told Jesse that Chris wanted

295
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,480
to take her somewhere special as a

296
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,600
surprise to celebrate her being

297
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,000
pregnant. They planned to spend the

298
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,399
whole day together. So when Aaron went

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,600
to Joshua Tree National Park on June

300
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,240
28th, she was planning to meet Chris.

301
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,480
And on Monday, June 30th, the detectives

302
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,639
found Aaron's abandoned blue Corolla

303
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,560
about 5 miles outside Joshua

304
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,399
Tree. Did police have their suspect? The

305
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,320
answer is next. Plus, an inside look at

306
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,920
the police interrogation tapes that

307
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,800
involve a confession that you have to

308
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,800
see to believe. We are back talking

309
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,720
about how a twisted love triangle led to

310
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,959
the murder of a Marine's wife. Aaron

311
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,839
Corwin. The police now have a lead

312
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,240
suspect, Chris Lee, the possible father

313
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,000
of her child from their secret affair.

314
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,160
In this clip of his interrogation,

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,480
you're about to see. Look what happened

316
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,639
when police asked Chris if he had

317
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,519
anything suspicious in his phone search

318
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,800
history. Take a look. I was having a

319
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,160
conversation with one of the guys in the

320
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,079
duty there. Um, it came up randomly, you

321
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,399
know, random Marine talk about the best

322
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,279
way to dispose of the body. And how long

323
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,600
was that? Um, it was the last time I was

324
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,240
on

325
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,120
duty.

326
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,800
So, before I went on

327
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,279
leave, probably just under a month ago.

328
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,560
What' you search on? Uh, we were using

329
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:44,160
Google on my phone and uh his phone. I

330
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,680
think that their phone. Yes. Okay. What

331
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,279
were the results? What'd you find out?

332
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,600
Um, pigs. Pigs? Mhm. What does it say

333
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,600
pigs do? They eat them. Are you serious?

334
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,279
Mhm. I've never heard of that.

335
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,839
Capitalism. Mhm.

336
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,920
Shocking, huh? Seems pretty clear. Chris

337
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,160
searched for ways to dispose of a dead

338
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,160
body on his phone. That was just a month

339
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,240
prior to Aaron's murder. True crime

340
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,160
journalist Shana Hogan is back. And the

341
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,120
lawyer who prosecuted this case, Shawn

342
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,880
Derty, is joining us via Zoom. So,

343
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,959
Shana, the police at this point were

344
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,440
convinced Chris was Aeron's killer. Why

345
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,199
did all the signs seem to point to him?

346
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,519
Well, first it was Chris's changing

347
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,519
story. Um, you know, after they talked

348
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,279
to Jesse, they knew that Chris was the

349
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,440
one who intended to meet Aaron out there

350
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,040
in the desert that day. Um, then there

351
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,440
was the evidence that was found in the

352
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,519
minehaft. Chris had borrowed a propane

353
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,760
tank and that was found at the bottom of

354
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,079
the mine shaft along with Aaron's body.

355
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,040
Um, also when he was arrested, they

356
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,079
discovered that uh a homemade garat uh

357
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,680
in his mother's car and it was almost

358
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,560
identical to the one that was found

359
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,399
wrapped around Aaron's neck. Also, at

360
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,920
the bottom of the mine shaft, um there

361
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,920
was some DNA evidence that was

362
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,880
collected. There was a sprite bottle

363
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,120
that had Aaron and Chris's DNA mixed.

364
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,440
And then finally, um it turns out that

365
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,079
he was trying to incinerate her body.

366
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,440
So, uh, he had made a homemade torch out

367
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,320
of a Marine Corp t-shirt and that had

368
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,160
his DNA exclusively on it. Oh, so the

369
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,440
propane tank was to throw on there and

370
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,199
he was going to light it on fire

371
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,519
remotely with that? Yes. To try and

372
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,199
incinerate her body. Oh my goodness. So,

373
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,880
Sean, what made prosecuting a case

374
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,240
against Chris so difficult when these

375
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,120
facts seem so cut and dry?

376
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
Well, I think anytime uh in a criminal

377
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,639
case, I have the burden of proof beyond

378
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,360
a reasonable doubt to convince 12

379
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,079
people. Um cases really aren't cut and

380
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,560
dry when you get to court. Um initially

381
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,079
the challenge was when I first came onto

382
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,720
the case or learned about the case was

383
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,760
we didn't have a body. Um which leads to

384
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,560
the suggestion she may have ran away. Um

385
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,880
a and when a body and when evidence is

386
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,880
in the desert for that long in such a

387
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,759
harsh environment um evidence tends to

388
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,000
be lost. For instance, um there was no

389
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,279
evidence that Aaron was in fact pregnant

390
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,160
because her body was too decomposed.

391
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,160
I see. So Sean, the defense only called

392
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,920
one witness to the stand and that was

393
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,759
Chris himself. Why was this defense sort

394
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,600
of unusual? Why this tactic is not

395
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,920
common?

396
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,519
Well, his defense essentially was that

397
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,199
one night after um his wife was giving

398
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,839
his daughter a bath, they noticed some

399
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,880
redness on the crotch area of their

400
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:33,440
daughter. Um his wife, Chris Lee's wife,

401
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,199
wondered aloud if, you know, maybe Aaron

402
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,639
had caused that. Um

403
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:42,639
he admitted to being in the desert with

404
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:46,759
her that day. um finally on the stand um

405
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,519
he asked her um you

406
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:52,360
know essentially the culminated in him

407
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:57,040
asking her did you touch my daughter

408
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,320
um and did you molest my daughter and he

409
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
claims in his testimony

410
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,280
that Aaron said yes but and that's the

411
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,039
last words he heard

412
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,880
um what he was trying to convince the

413
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,319
jury of was that he acted in a blind

414
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,280
rage age. So, it's commonly called a

415
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,120
crime of passion defense.

416
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,240
Um, but really it's a provocation and

417
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,480
you're provoked into this rage. Um, so

418
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,640
in that

419
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,480
respect, it was not only unusual, it was

420
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,559
in my view just disgusting. Um, for him

421
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,760
to make that

422
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,000
claim, knowing that she's not there to

423
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,440
defend herself and knowing that all he

424
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,760
had done to plan it and to even get to

425
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,679
that point. Just to be clear everybody,

426
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,360
Chris admitted that he approached Corin

427
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,600
from behind and strangled her for at

428
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,919
least five minutes with a grat made up

429
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,640
of two pieces of rebar and a cord that

430
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,000
looks like this. Now, Sean, you I

431
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,080
understand you brought a life-sized

432
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,480
dummy into the court to show this murder

433
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,640
was premeditated and deliberate. And if

434
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,240
you can recount that to our audience, I

435
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,520
would appreciate it because it was vital

436
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,400
in the ultimate decision of the jury.

437
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,480
Sure. I

438
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,080
um as I said, I had some indication that

439
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,840
he was going to go with well, I did it,

440
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,559
but I was provoked. Um so, uh I decided

441
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,720
to bring a life-sized dummy into court.

442
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:23,280
I uh created a Grot on my own. And

443
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,440
during cross-examination, I asked him to

444
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,400
show us how he did it. And I used the

445
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,160
dummy

446
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,480
um and put the Groat in his hands

447
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,520
directly in front of the jurors. uh and

448
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,799
he showed us how he did it uh there in

449
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,240
front of her.

450
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:44,320
So that's what I did and and I think it

451
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,960
was effective in showing at any given

452
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,240
moment he could have stopped but he

453
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,840
didn't because he thought about life, he

454
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,480
thought about death and he chose to kill

455
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,320
Aaron. Was his defense successful at

456
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,120
all?

457
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,960
No. Um the jury found Tim guilty after

458
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,640
about an hour and a half of first-degree

459
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,160
murder and they found the special

460
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,240
circumstance of a line and wait true. Um

461
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,240
so line and weight is essentially waited

462
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,840
for an opportunity to act

463
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,600
and from a position of advantage killed

464
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,280
the other person in this case Aaron.

465
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,360
So Shannon Chris has been honorably

466
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,039
discharged from the re at this point.

467
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,160
He's planning on returning to Alaska

468
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:29,200
with his wife the week following that.

469
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,679
Why? Why? Why just go up and run away?

470
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,080
Why kill her? What was the point? Yeah.

471
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,600
At this point, he uh didn't want the

472
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,039
responsibilities of paying child

473
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,200
support. And it's it's really actually

474
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,760
common that women who are killed by

475
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,160
their lovers and their boyfriends to get

476
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,160
rid of the baby to um not have that

477
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,400
responsibility and not have to take care

478
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,720
of it. Just underline that. Did you all

479
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,559
hear that? Murder is a top cause. Among

480
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,919
injury related deaths, only car

481
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,520
accidents are greater than murder for

482
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,360
pregnant women. It's something I'd never

483
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,799
thought of. It's unimaginable. And the

484
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,160
prospect of a new child, particularly if

485
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,080
the pregnancy is unwanted, not only

486
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,840
brings on stress, it also represents a

487
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,240
loss of control, which is what I suspect

488
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,000
was really going on in Lee's mind. So,

489
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,160
if I can ask, what happened to Aaron's

490
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,960
husband, John? Where is he now? And also

491
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,640
Chris's wife, Nicole. Yeah, John um was

492
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,799
honorably discharged early from the

493
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,039
Marines because of this tragedy and he

494
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,120
returned home to Oakidge, Tennessee,

495
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,080
where he um went back to school and got

496
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,320
a job as a welder. Um he ended up

497
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,200
meeting a nice young woman and got

498
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,280
married and has a child now. Oh, good

499
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,360
for him. And Nicole is more of a

500
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,520
mystery. Throughout the trial, she

501
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,240
actually defended Chris. Um she wore his

502
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,840
dog tags to court. At one point, she

503
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,960
confronted Lore outside of the

504
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,280
courtroom. um defending her husband. And

505
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,440
so at this point, I know she's back in

506
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,880
Alaska raising their daughter while

507
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,880
Chris serves a life sentence in um

508
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,840
California, but she has maintained, you

509
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,280
know, stayed stayed by him. Um but the

510
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,600
defense, the detectives and the

511
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,000
prosecutor had actually looked into, you

512
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,880
know, her as a possible co-conspirator

513
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,520
in this murder and at one point, um you

514
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,840
know, we're looking pretty heavily. Um,

515
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,520
so if any new evidence surfaces, there's

516
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,200
a good chance that there might be a

517
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,360
second trial in this case with Nicole as

518
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,120
the defendant. Shana, thank you very
