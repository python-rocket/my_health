00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,960
Today, the latest revelations into a

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,680
health alert we were the first to raise

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,840
the red flag about. Five years ago, we

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,840
asked the FDA to release information

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,160
about the long-term effects of

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320
corrective laser eye surgeries, which

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,480
they did. Now, we're investigating the

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,160
disturbing link between suicide and

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,480
these eye procedures, these surgeries

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,720
that promise to make your vision go from

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,880
this

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,840
to this,

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,559
but is leaving some people seeing this

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,239
and in constant crippling pain. In a

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,040
recently claimed the life of a beloved

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,000
meteorologist who took her own life two

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,079
months after the surgery,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,600
I am struggling a little bit. So, I do

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,360
still need all the prayers and the well

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,719
wishes cuz it's uh this is a hard go.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,680
The doctor said it could take up to 3

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,440
months or so before I feel like 100%

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,680
again.

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,559
That's beloved Detroit meteorologist

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,199
Jessica Star sharing the pain she was in

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,760
after complications from a newer LASIC

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,159
type surgery. Jessica struggled with

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,400
poor eyesight all her life. And after

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,200
the surgery, the mother of two tweeted

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,680
that her recovery was a struggle and a

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,320
challenging time. Jessica never

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,280
recovered. Last December, she took her

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,600
own life. Her death has raised questions

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,640
about the disturbing link between laser

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,799
eye surgeries and suicide as more cases

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,439
emerge. In October, Canadian TV reported

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,600
Paul Fitzpatrick, father of two, took

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,720
his own life, blaming the laser eye

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,880
surgery he went through back in 1996.

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,560
In a suicide note, he wrote, "Since

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,320
1996, pain, pain, and more pain. Please

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
forgive me for not being strong enough

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,640
to cope. The past few months have been

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,439
unbearable."

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,280
Every year, about 600,000 people get

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,159
LASIK. Many lured by the ads. But a new

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,280
FDA study revealed LASIC risks were

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,040
higher than some originally thought.

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,560
If you type into Google LASIC

50
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,200
complications,

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,039
you'll get pages and pages. You can

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,000
never predict when an eye is going to go

53
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,959
wrong after LASIC. Here's what can go

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,200
wrong. Patients may achieve 2020 vision

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,520
on an eye chart, but be seeing that

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,879
chart in double or seeing halos or

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,360
starbursts, especially at night. And the

58
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,319
most concerning problem of all, dry eye

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,319
pain. so severe that some people have

60
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,959
committed suicide.

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,760
All he would talk about was his eye pain

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,360
in his eyes and how he couldn't live

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,440
that way and it eventually cost him his

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,680
life.

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,920
In past investigations, we went

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,480
undercover to see what LASIC centers

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,959
tell patients in person. Could I really

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,680
toss away my glasses like the ads say?

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,959
You can. Yes, sir. Use 15 minutes. Right

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
after that, you can you don't need the

71
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,519
glasses at all. We have the technology

72
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,760
to uh get rid of reading glasses and

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,319
distance glasses. Really? It's pretty uh

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,480
foolproof at this point. And when we

75
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
asked about side effects, the LASIC

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,800
specialists downplayed them. Are the dry

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,560
eyes temporary? It is. It's not that

78
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,640
common. I would say have probably less

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,200
than 5% of the population. I shouldn't

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,120
worry about the night vision.

81
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,920
Okay. Never want to say zero, but it's

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,159
certainly less than 1% chance.

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,400
Today, what do you need to know about

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,040
laser eye surgery?

85
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,120
[Applause]

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,680
Joining us are Sarah, who wish she'd

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,760
never had eye surgery 3 years ago, and

88
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
Paula, a patient turd advocate, who says

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
LASIC destroyed her eyesight and left

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,440
her with chronic pain. We're going to

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,840
start with Sarah. Why did you decide to

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
get the LASIC procedure? It was pretty

93
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,599
simple for me. I just wanted to wake up

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,599
and be able to see without glasses and

95
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,599
contacts. So, a few weeks after the

96
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,920
operation, you started experiencing some

97
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,480
symptoms. Yes. Right after the

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,439
operation, um I could see I could see

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,519
2020. I still do. But I immediately had

100
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,560
dry eye. It just kept getting worse and

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,720
worse. Um it eventually turned into uh

102
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,680
corneal neuralgia, which is basically

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,160
nerve damage, nerve pain. Um so I take

104
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,919
something every day for the pain. Um I

105
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,239
put in eye drops eight times a day for

106
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,000
the past three years. So, it's important

107
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,840
to know some of the risks of LASIC.

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,120
There's the dry eyes and the pain that

109
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,280
Sarah just described. There's also

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,400
visual aberrations like seeing double

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,600
which looks like this, right? Or glares.

112
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,040
And glares again like looking at the

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,280
sun, but it's not really the sun causing

114
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,280
this. There's halos, so you'll see

115
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,960
little rings around lights. And then

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,520
there's starbursts, which are especially

117
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,919
problematic if you're driving. Sir, were

118
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,440
you informed of any of these risks? I

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,320
remember when I was reading my consent

120
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,560
form, it said something like 1% chance

121
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
patients get dry eyes and then it listed

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,160
the things you just listed, but I had no

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
idea what that was. The 1% complication

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,080
rate, which was also in that little tape

125
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,240
piece said to us by a doctor, is what I

126
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,759
had always heard as well. Mhm. We're

127
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,120
going to challenge that number for good

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,120
reason. I think I don't think anyone

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,560
really believes that number anymore. No.

130
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
But the issue that really got my

131
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,800
attention was the pain that has led to

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,000
we believe suicides and life destroying

133
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,440
challenges. How bad is your pain bid?

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
It's really hard to explain if you don't

135
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,280
have it, but it's this burning deep

136
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,680
intense pain. It's kind of like there's

137
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,440
like a toothache in your eye and it it's

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,000
not something anybody would want to live

139
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,960
with. I understand you've considered

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,680
some drastic measures because of it. I

141
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,360
completely understand um someone wanting

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,360
to kill themselves over it because when

143
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,759
I was at my worst um I I told myself if

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,080
if I don't get better, if I don't find a

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,919
way to get rid of this pain, I I don't

146
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,919
want to live anymore. How can someone

147
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,600
live like that?

148
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,880
So, you're not the only person we spoke

149
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,160
to. Obviously, we spoke to a lot of

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,639
folks. Others have experienced the same

151
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,880
excruciating pain. One woman we spoke to

152
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,039
lost her eye as a result of this

153
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,000
surgery. And I want to get Paul into

154
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,840
this conversation. And you had your

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,039
lasacic surgery 18 years ago. That's

156
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,960
right. And you've been living with

157
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,560
long-term side effects from that

158
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,759
procedure.

159
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
That's correct. Let's start with your

160
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,199
vision. Is it 2020? My vision,

161
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,520
if you if I sat down and looked at an

162
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,960
eye chart in a doctor's office, I might

163
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,440
be able to make out the 2030 line with

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,720
both eyes open. But my vision was a

165
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,759
complete train wreck. Massive starburst,

166
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,080
halos, multiple images. I could look up

167
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,960
at the moon at night and see up to eight

168
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,960
smeared overlapping moons with a massive

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,840
halo around the whole thing. It was just

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,600
ghastly and that was considered as a

171
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,440
success.

172
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,280
And were you warned at all about these

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,000
complications? I was given a one single

174
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,479
sheet consent form front and back and it

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,039
listed a lot of different complications

176
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,479
that could arise but it never said

177
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,240
anything about permanent chronic. Those

178
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,199
words were not used. Everything was

179
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,919
dismissed as temporary side effects.

180
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,000
It'll get better. Give it time. No one

181
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,319
ever told me that I could be visually

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,720
disabled for life. So, what do you want

183
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,360
people watching right now to know about

184
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,720
what you went through? I want people to

185
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,880
understand this surgery is not as safe

186
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,240
as it is portrayed. It is not like going

187
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,080
to get a manicure or or a haircut. It's

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,080
a dangerous surgery. It's a risky

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,080
surgery. It's it's one it's an

190
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,080
inherently harmful surgery. I wish

191
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,440
people understood that. All right. So,

192
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,120
when we come back, our investigation

193
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,840
continues. Do we know enough about the

194
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,039
risks of the surgery and the suicides

195
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,720
that we're reading about? Are

196
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,039
complications from this popular surgery

197
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,160
more common than we thought? The dry

198
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,880
eyes that you get from LASIK, they don't

199
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,120
go away. I'm 19 years posttop and I

200
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,479
still have horrible headaches, dry eye

201
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,080
pain. I spend so much money on eye

202
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,560
drops, ointments, supplements, anything

203
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,319
to just make the pain stop. We are back

204
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,879
investigating the disturbing emerging

205
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,639
link between laser eye surgeries and big

206
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,720
complications that sometimes result in

207
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,479
suicide. Do we know enough about the

208
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,080
long-term side effects of the world's

209
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,400
most popular elective surgery?

210
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,560
Opthalmologist Dr. Yun Rapaort joins us.

211
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,280
She not only performs LASIC, she had the

212
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
procedure done on her own eyes. That was

213
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,000
important for me because a lot of

214
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,160
doctors haven't had it done themselves

215
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,919
and you took that step. What do you and

216
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,440
you know some opthalmologists are

217
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,919
reporting very low incidences of

218
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,919
complications but we're hearing more and

219
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,000
more studies reports of people having

220
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,080
big problems again in these suicides.

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,479
What do you make of these? Yeah, I mean

222
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,080
suicide is definitely a very serious and

223
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,959
devastating issue and it's under

224
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,719
discussed in society in general. Uh

225
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,480
those patients who committed suicide,

226
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,560
their families definitely deserve a

227
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,360
voice. they were unhappy with their

228
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,959
outcome and they had severe pain and

229
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,279
issues that led to that. Uh I think that

230
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,959
as physicians we want to hear from these

231
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,200
patients because our role as physicians

232
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,680
is to care for patients, optimize

233
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,080
outcomes and treat complications.

234
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,240
And um in some of the studies they found

235
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,880
that patients didn't report all their

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,120
complications to to their physician. So,

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,440
I think the takeaway message for me is I

238
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
would want to know if any of my patients

239
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,279
were experiencing things that were so

240
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,959
unbearable that that led to these. That

241
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,160
might explain part of the gap. Uh, we've

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,920
been talking to people, you've been

243
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,279
hearing people complain quite loudly

244
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,000
about the fact they had complications

245
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,000
far beyond what they expected. So if if

246
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,320
you can explain to us LASIC which I know

247
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,320
is just maybe half of all the total

248
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440
corrective procedures that are done so

249
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,720
people get an idea of what's going on

250
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
and maybe when you do this you can

251
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
explain why some of these complications

252
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,040
especially the dry eyes and nerve damage

253
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,120
are happening. Sure. So uh LASIC is just

254
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,120
one of many types of refractive

255
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,839
corrective procedures but it is the most

256
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,920
common. So in LASIC a laser creates a

257
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,760
flap about so you actually cut into the

258
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,600
cornea here. It's created with a laser,

259
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,880
right? Not no blade. And then it's

260
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,399
lifted. That flap is about 100 110

261
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,640
microns. The flap is lifted. The laser

262
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,880
then ablates or changes the shape of the

263
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,040
cornea right here, the surface. I'm

264
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,519
sorry. That laser is is shaving off tiny

265
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,320
bits of a half a millimeter thickness

266
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,959
material, even microns. Tiny tiny tiny.

267
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,120
So, it shaves it and it's custom uh

268
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,279
performed to the patient's prescription.

269
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,160
Um so everything is custom done and then

270
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,240
the flap is put back down. So that is

271
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,360
what LASIC is. Whenever you lift the

272
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,079
flap you are going through corial nerves

273
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,880
and for some patients that does result

274
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,480
in worsening dry eye and corial damage

275
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,160
later on. So when we first heard about

276
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,160
the complications of LASIC the industry

277
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,360
said it was a complication rate of less

278
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,480
than 1%. That's what I was told and it

279
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,519
seemed surprising to me because I was

280
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
hearing about it so much. I thought

281
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,480
maybe I spoke to everyone who had a

282
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,399
complication. But when we looked at the

283
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,279
published reports, the actual incidence

284
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
was about 20%. Now, since we did our

285
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,560
first show, the FDA did a clinical

286
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,560
trial, and here's what they found. Most

287
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,800
people who had visual problems prior to

288
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,040
LASIC actually improved after the

289
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,279
surgery. So, that part seems to be

290
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,800
pretty pretty good and legitimate. The

291
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,720
vast majority of folks are pleased with

292
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,440
results, but this is a big butt. About

293
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,680
30 to 40% of people without problems to

294
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,320
start with reported problems 3 months

295
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,839
after lasic surgery. So let's walk over

296
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,920
and join our two women who've had

297
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,000
unsuccessful lasic surgery. If

298
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,320
epthalmologist quoted a complication

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,519
rate or a side effect rate for let's say

300
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,760
three months, is the right number 20%.

301
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,160
They don't report it accurately. I'm

302
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,600
sure that I'm a a success in where I

303
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,040
went and got my surgery because I can

304
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,640
see 2020 and they don't the dry eye was

305
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,399
just a side effect. It's not taken

306
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,120
seriously. I don't So you're both

307
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,360
success stories then? Yes.

308
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,279
I I can tell you they use what I call

309
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,040
fuzzy LASIC math to get these numbers.

310
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,519
So reached out to the FDA for comment

311
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,920
and here's what they said in part. The

312
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,279
FDA's work with LASIC is ongoing. We are

313
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,200
also in the process of developing a

314
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,959
LASIC patient labeling guidance that

315
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,640
will provide recommendations to industry

316
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,600
about how to clearly communicate risks

317
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,200
of LASIC to patients. The Academy of

318
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,040
Opthalmology says LASIC is not for

319
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,720
everyone. They agree with what you're

320
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,760
saying and we reached out for a

321
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,360
statement. Here's what they said in

322
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
part. The risks of LASIC surgery are

323
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,959
known to the opthalmology community.

324
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,600
More than 300 peer-reviewed studies have

325
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,839
shown that on average 95% of patients

326
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,560
are satisfied with their outcome after

327
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,320
lasic surgery. But the FDA study found

328
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,040
that 30 to 40% of people without

329
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,600
problems start to report problems after

330
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,760
the lasacic surgery. So, Dr. Rapour, how

331
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,480
do you reconcile those numbers? How can

332
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,920
95% of people be happy but 30 to 40% are

333
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,240
reporting complications? Those are

334
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,399
short-term statistics. one month, three

335
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,079
months, no more than six months. They

336
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
want you to look at shortterm

337
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,240
satisfaction. They don't want you to

338
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,480
look at long-term safety and efficacy.

339
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,959
They want you to look at short term. You

340
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,519
agree, Dr. Apport? I agree. I think um

341
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,680
the point is that this is one snapshot

342
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,839
in time uh that they conducted in

343
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,399
questionnaires. It'd be interesting to

344
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,480
see the statistics at a year, at five

345
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,839
years, at 10 years. Dr. Ratport, thank

346
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
you very much. I really appreciate you

347
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,279
spending time with us today. I know it's

348
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,120
been a very difficult road for you. I

349
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,560
wish you the best. Thank Thank you.
