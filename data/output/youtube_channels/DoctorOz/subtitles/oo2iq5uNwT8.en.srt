1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,240
If laughter is the best medicine to get

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,279
ready for a double dose from one of the

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,400

her kids, her hot flashes, she finds the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,759
funny in all of it. Please welcome my

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,759
friend Wanda Sykes.

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,149
[Applause]

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,149
[Music]

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,599
It's a workout.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,120
It's a workout to get here.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,200
So, I got like a little Gatorade table

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,879
or something halfway here. Good lord.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,320
Well, thank you for coming. Well, thank

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,680
you for having me. Let's start with

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,920
these hot flashes I've been hearing

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
about. You turn 50, right? How bad are

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,320
they? They're they're pretty bad. It's

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,120
like, you know, like the night sweats

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:56,399
and uh I put it this way. If I ever

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,039
murdered somebody,

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,120
all I need is a jury of my peers, a

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
bunch of women also going through hot

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,799
flashes. And they would get it. I would

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,280
walk. They would let me go. They don't

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,000
understand. They like, "Oh, yeah. I

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,960
understand. It's it's it's embarrassing.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,720
You're just sitting there all a sudden

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,200
you feel it coming on and it's you're

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,520
just sitting there just a mess. Just a

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,280
mess." Well, sometimes you do things

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,119
that contribute to this problem. I

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,680
understand you have a love affair with

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,240
wine. Oh, I love wine. Yes. And it helps

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,720
you unwind a little bit. Yes. Yes. Wine

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,119
keeps me sane.

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,400
But that hot flashes make you insane.

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,280
They bounce each other out a little bit

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,600
cuz wine causes hot flashes.

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,360
Well,

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,000
guess I'm just going to be a hot, sweaty

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,000
mess then, huh?

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,680
I deal with the hot flashes. Trust me, I

44
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,479
I'm I'll be better as sweaty and a

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
little tipsy, people. So, father's got

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,759
these beautiful 5-year-old twins, Lucas

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,759
and Olivia. What's the best part about

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,320
motherhood for you? The best It's the

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,040
most rewarding thing I think I've I've

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,360
ever done, and it's the unconditional

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,799
love that you know, but it's uh the I

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,399
guess that's the best part. What's the

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,720
worst part about motherhood? The worst

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,520
part is they're in your face every

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,360
minute. They they just suck the life out

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,840
of you. It's like all your hopes and

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,000
dreams just toss them in the trash can

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,319
and just you just put put your life on

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,560
hold and that's it. You know, cuz I I'm

60
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,800
tell you I I used to I used to know a

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,760
lot of stuff, Dr. Oz. I used to, you

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,400
know, read the paper and watch news. Now

63
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,200
it's nothing. I just empty up here. It's

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,599
just all kids and you're all constantly

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,920
like solving problems and everything.

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,599
And and I I just picture like, okay,

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,400
this is what I'm going through as a

68
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,280
parent. So imagine if you're doing this

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
and you were like the president.

70
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
Can you imagine that? You know, like

71
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,680
like the president, you know, run

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,319
running and say, "Hey, uh uh Mr.

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,440
President, Vadam President, uh uh Putin

74
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,920
just invaded Crimea and and he's taking

75
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,680
part of the Ukraine." And as my mother,

76
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,840
I would just go, "Well, you tell them

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
that I'll take it and now neither one of

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,159
them can have it."

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,159
Yeah.

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,599
So, let me move on to something because

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,440
you're so open about your health. Yes.

82
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,040
2011 diagnosed with breast cancer,

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,879
right? We all probably have heard the

84
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
story, but part you don't know about is

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,239
the difficult decisions you had to make,

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,480
including the decision to remove both

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,760
your breasts, right? To me, it wasn't a

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,519
difficult uh decision. Um, I have a very

89
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,360
strong history of breast cancer on my

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,360
mother's side. Like, she's lost, you

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
know, like two sisters and we have like

92
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,040
first cousins like, you know, and and

93
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,760
also prostate cancer, you know, for the

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,319
men. So, it's a strong history there.

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,879
And actually, I was very fortunate how I

96
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,640
found out I had cancer cuz I went in for

97
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,200
a breast reduction cuz I I had real big

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,840
girls. I mean, they were they were big.

99
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,080
I mean, you know, my my my back was sore

100
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
and I got constantly knocking over

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,799
stuff. You know, you going to reach up

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,439
for something and it just clear out the

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,959
whole shelf. It was it's just awful. I

104
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,640
mean, they they were big. I would take

105
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,720
my bra off and people thought Law and

106
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,720
Order was coming on. You know what I'm

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,720
saying?

108
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,599
So is Lord know that no I just took my

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,359
bra off. So I had the reduction. It was

110
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,759
through the pathology that they found

111
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,840
you know early stage uh uh breast

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,520
cancer. So I I just said you know what

113
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,520
I'm going to what is my best odds to not

114
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
have it. So I opted to have the the

115
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,800
double mastctomy. You ever look back

116
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,919
with regret thinking maybe I didn't have

117
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,560
to have that? No. No n not at all. I you

118
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,800
know I feel great. uh you know I'm not

119
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,720
like worried about okay what what is it

120
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,880
doing now? What is it? You know and and

121
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,919
guess what now I can swim Dr. Oz. I it's

122
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
like having built-in floaties.

123
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,479
I'm Before I would get in the pool and

124
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,240
just sink and then then after the after

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,320
the surgery I got in the pool and I was

126
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,120
like hey what's going on here? All

127
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,000
right. This is nice. That's right. This

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,240
is all right.

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,240
Watch out, Michael Phips. It's coming

130
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,720

Facebook about you. Here's a It's honest

133
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,400
question. This is from Sheree. She asks,

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
this is her question, not mine. Okay.

135
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,160
When you had your breast removed, how

136
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,080
did you decide how big to make your new

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,440
breast during your reconstruction? Oh,

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,199
that's a great question. That is a great

139
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
question. You know, cuz I went I started

140
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,560
with the reduction, you know, so I

141
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,160
wanted them smaller and then when I

142
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,960
found out I got cancer, I was like, you

143
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,120

flashes. Yeah. So you lie like that,

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,240
right? So that's the first mistake

180
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,919
because you lie on your back like that

181
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,680
and all of a sudden all that tissue in

182
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,000
your throat collapses back and you sound

183
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,680
like a kazoo. Oh, right. So we're going

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,680
to change that and I can understand

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,520
exactly why this would bother the people

186
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,880
in your life. So the b most important

187
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,479
thing is open up that airway. So the

188
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,240
best way to prevent you from storing is

189
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,560
to lie on your side. But you don't line

190
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,360
your side too much. I guess I I can try.

191
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,120
I mean All right. No, I I I can tell you

192
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,120
right now you're not going to do that.

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,599
All right, here. Hop up here. I got a

194
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,440
better idea for you. Okay, you're going

195
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,360
to love this idea. I built this for you.

196
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,919
These are your panty hoes. Got it from

197
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,599
your house. They're very nice, by the

198
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,319
way. So, you take the panty hose, right?

199
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,599
You put tennis ball in one of the foots.

200
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,199
I'm coming back to this in a second.

201
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,440
Stay with me here. All right. If you

202
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,280
don't mind some 50 shades of Dr. Oz

203
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,280
going on in here. What you doing, Dr.

204
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Eyes? 50 Shades of Dr. Oz. That's great.

205
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,759
So, come over here. Give me 50 shades.

206
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,360
You put put your arms up. Put your arms

207
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,440
up.

208
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,479
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Okay. So, now

209
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,319
turn around here. So, so I'm going to

210
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,800
tie this up here. I'm tying the

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
stocking. Not Wanda. All right. Put this

212
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,479
little ball back here. And as you tie

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,919
this ball back here. Okay. It's now

214
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,879
going to be a little bit of a hindrance.

215
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,240
You're not going to want to lie your

216
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,759
back because every time you lie on your

217
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,000
back, it's going to remind you to tie on

218
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,599
your side. All right. Give it a try.

219
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,280
Okay. Here. I'm going here. I'm lie

220
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,360
here. I'm I'm going to pretend I'm your

221
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
wife. So, I'm here. All right. So, I'm

222
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,759
lying like this. Okay. What do you

223
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,560
think? It bother you? Oh. Oh. Oh, yeah.

224
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,039
That's I

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,039
Oh, ouch. That's a dislocate my spine

226
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,960
right there. What? Here. Roll towards

227
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,759
me. Roll this way. See if it works

228
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,919
better. Ow. Ow. Oh, please. You whine

229
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,919
like this.

230
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,560
Wonder.

231
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,080
You got to love her. Listen, she puts on

232
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,680
a great show wherever she is. And guess

233
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,360
what? She's coming to Jacksonville,

234
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,959
Clear Water, Miami, Florida next week,

235
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
and lots of other great cities, too.

236
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,240
Catch this woman. She's funnier than

237
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,680
anything. We'll be right back. Thank you
