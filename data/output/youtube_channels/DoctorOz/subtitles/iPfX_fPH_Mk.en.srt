00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,400
Today's a dream come true. Jay Leno was

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,880
the reigning king of late night for

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,559
almost 30 years, winning an Emmy award,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,800
a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,400
He's even a master mechanic. But his

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,880
high cholesterol is putting life into

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,360
perspective for him one joke at a time.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:26,460
Please welcome Jay Leno.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,460
[Applause]

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,880
Good to see you. Thank you for having me

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,120
on. I'm so happy. I appreciate it. Oh, I

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,120
like this.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,879
Hello.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
Well, they love seeing you. Well, thank

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,640
you. It's great to be here. This is my

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,280
first time. I forgot we met backstage

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,480
where a while back at today's show. I've

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
seen you a couple times. But today's

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,280
show. But I tell you, I used to I

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,920
started this show 10 years ago at 30

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,680
Rockefeller Center. And Fallon and I

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,399
started the exact same time. And I would

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,920
watch the feed from your studio and see

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
think see to myself, this guy's an icon.

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
He is working his tail off. Well,

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,080
actually, I've got a bit more work to

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,680
do. If you look at my tail,

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,360
you quite quite a bit more work to do to

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,799
get it off. But thank you. I appreciate

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
that. So, although you haven't seen me,

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,439
I've seen you plenty and we've all

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,040
admired your work. Actually, when you

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960
watch the news these days, you ever sort

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,960
of think my oh man, that's a good joke

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,119
in there. You know, it's different. You

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,880
know, everything now is so polarizing.

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,439
You know, I I when I did the show, it

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,560
was kind of, you know, Clinton was horny

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,040
and Bush was dumb. It was a simpler No,

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,159
you know, I mean I mean it was it was a

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,840
different time, you know. It wasn't this

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,560
Everybody's very angry now. Everybody's

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,720
very polarized and and and I I miss the

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,400
idea of just sort of poking. I always

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,040
like to to make fun of people to their

46
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,240
face if if they laugh at it. only one I

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
remember once I was doing the Washington

48
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,560
correspondence dinner and John Kerry was

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,320
sitting right in front and I said John

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:01,320
why the long face you know and it got a

51
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,920
and I got and it got a big laugh you

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,000
know but it wasn't I wasn't attacking

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,039
somebody's patriotism I wasn't saying

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,599
they were unamerican you know I I did it

55
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,080
when you question people's judgment not

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,160
their motive yes you know now everybody

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,000
questions motive and it just makes it it

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,760
makes it tricky. You know, the the funny

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
part about comedy is taking it to the

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,879
next level. It was like a punch line

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,640
used to be that's like the president

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,160
being with a porn star. Okay. Well, now

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,959
the president is with a porn star. Where

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,120
do we go? Okay. Where do you go from

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,160
there? Where do you take it now? You

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,599
know, you can't you you can't there's no

67
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,319
there's no out there's nothing

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,319
ridiculous enough now. You know, I used

69
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,680
to watch that show House of Cards and

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,879
go, "Well, that's ridiculous." And that

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,670
could never Now it looks like a

72
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,040
documentary, you know. But it does.

73
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,239
[Applause]

74
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,160
So you and your beautiful wife

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
approaching 40 years of marriage. That's

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,519
right. 40 years of marriage. It's

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
biblical in significance. How do you I I

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,160
look all the things you've done in your

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,080
life, that's what I would respect you

80
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,599
for the most. Okay. So how did you pick

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,800
the right person for you? How do you

82
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,400
keep the marriage healthy? Well, you

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,599
know, I remember once I had Drew Barmore

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,599
on the show and she was getting married

85
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,879
and she's asking and I, you know, I

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,560
would say to people, you always marry

87
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,319
your conscience. Marry the person you

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,879
would like to be. If you marry someone

89
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,319
like yourself, well, now I have two

90
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,360
greedy people in the house. You know

91
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
what I'm saying? You know what I'm

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,440
saying? I mean, I learn cars and

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,800
motorcycles. My wife likes to work with

94
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,519
women's groups and help give

95
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,040
scholarships and stuff. So, oh, I can,

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
you know, she learns a little bit about

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,879
cars. I learn a little bit of the Bronte

98
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,000
sisters. It works out pretty good, you

99
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,000
know. I I mean, for me, the 40 years has

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,640
gone by like that. We have fun. We laugh

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,239
every day. You know, when I do gigs, I

102
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,920
fly home every night. You know, I don't

103
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,920
I don't stay in Vegas because you get in

104
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,080
trouble. Just fly home every night and

105
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,239
and it's good. We have you you know, uh

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,319
you know, the real key is to make show

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,799
business money and lead a normal life.

108
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,959
Yes. That's that's hard. Cuz like in in

109
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,560
my

110
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,840
house, in my family, I'm a big shot. I

111
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,599
can put, you know, I can afford to put a

112
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,599
roof on my uncle Lou's house. And when I

113
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,599
go home, no, the big meatballs for Jay.

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,840
No, no, no, that big meatballs for Jay.

115
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,519
And I get the big meatball and works out

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,080
okay cuz you put the roof up. All right.

117
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,840
You mentioned traveling. So 210 nights a

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
year or not nights, days a year I'm

119
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,600
told. You're scheduled and busy. You're

120
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
68 years old. I mean, how do you do

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,079
that? And what do you eat, by the way,

122
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
when you're on the road that much? We

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,639
see what our president. Well, again, my

124
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,160
diet is not one to envy. I wouldn't, you

125
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,160
know, uh, yeah, I I mean, I eat mostly

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120
guy food, you know. This is your guy

127
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,880
food from a a past era. What is that?

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,600
Has it changed? It was unidentifiable.

129
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,520
We tried. Oh. Uh, that Well, I'm rich.

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,680
It's one of the five food groups. Pizza,

131
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,360
hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak,

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,400
you know. So I I I take from those from

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,160
those five food groups.

134
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,919
Now that has had a repercussion as it

135
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,199
does for many Americans. You you found

136
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,960
out, I guess, that your cholesterol was

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
high. My cholesterol is high. Yeah. And

138
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,440
that's why I got involved with Amgen

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,120
doing this uh cholesterol 911.com

140
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,960
campaign because cholesterol is one of

141
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,039
those deals. You know, in the last

142
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,680
couple years we lost Rodney Dangerfield,

143
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,000
John Panette, Gary Shanley. Now, Gary,

144
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,039
oh no. played basketball, boxed. I mean,

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,360
he was an athletic guy. And it's one of

146
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,280
those things where high cholesterol just

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
hits you. You don't know. You know, if

148
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,560
you've got a stomach pain, you can go,

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,240
maybe we'll go to the doctor next week

150
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,800
if this keeps up or something. But with

151
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,479
high cholesterol, you can be in the best

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,240
shape of your life and then boom, it

153
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,520
hits you like a like a truck, you know.

154
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,720
So, did you expect to have high

155
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,960
cholesterol? Does it run in your family?

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
Any other risk factors? When you have an

157
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,759
Italian family, you don't really discuss

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,199
cholesterol.

159
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,400
Noat was you know yeah you don't really

160
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,919
Yeah know you eat

161
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,600
meat meatballs I get the big meatball

162
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,000
yeah you get yeah your cholesterol is

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,240
not really in it see I again when I see

164
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,320
I'm dyslexic here was the cure for

165
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,720
dyslexia when I was a kid smarten up

166
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,280
smarten up smarten up okay and and you

167
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,520
know I smartened up and it was it worked

168
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,440
you know so that's sort of how no nobody

169
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,479
ever made I have no idea what my parents

170
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,800
cholesterol was I had no idea but in

171
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,360
recent years. It's so easy to check now.

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,759
Yeah. And I tell people, go to ask your

173
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,319
doctor. Like for example, they've

174
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,000
recently found that laughter is not the

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,479
best medicine. In fact, it doesn't work

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,919
at all. It doesn't do anything. If a

177
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,440
guy's having a stroke and you tell him a

178
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,600
joke, two guys going to a bar. No, he's

179
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,199
he's not going to get better. So, don't

180
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,560
believe that whole laugh. But since you

181
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,319
brought that up, I mean, you you saved

182
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,319
Rod This is maybe Urban Law. Please

183
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,720
correct us, but Rodney Dangerfield was

184
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,560
having a stroke in your studio. Well,

185
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,720
true. What happened? I had Rodney on the

186
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,120
Tonight Show and I'm a huge fan of

187
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,960
Rodney and comics. We all study one

188
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
another. I know Rodney or Rodney. Hey,

189
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,240
Taylor. You know, he always had he had

190
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,240
that funny way about you know respect.

191
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,720
Yeah. And he was on the show and his

192
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,720
movements were just a little off and he

193
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,319
was sweating a little bit, not much. And

194
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
I remember I was sitting at the desk

195
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,160
enjoying Rodney's and I said to Debbie

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,479
Vickers, our producer, I said, "I think

197
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,960
Rodney's having a stroke. Call the call

198
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,880
the paramedics just in case." Really?

199
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,479
Okay. So Rodney sat down. Hey Jay, how

200
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,080
you doing? you know, and and he just

201
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,759
seemed a little more hyper than

202
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,120
normal. And he's in the dressing room

203
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,919
and the paramedics came back. I'm all

204
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,840
right. What are you doing? I said,

205
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,680
Rodney, they think he might have I'm

206
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,080
Well, he did. He had a mini stroke. And

207
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,680
I It's true. I remember I remember that

208
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,960
the paramedics said to me, you know, you

209
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,960
may have saved him from having a heart

210
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,360
attack. And I thought I didn't really do

211
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,919
anything. All I did was just look out

212
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,919
for my friend who seemed a little off

213
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,479
and just took the most minimal

214
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,240
precaution. It was no effort on my part.

215
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,120
I mean, you're not a hero. I just Oh,

216
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,960
but it just to teach people, watch out

217
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,800
for symptoms, even what they are.

218
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,919
Something just seems odd, you know.

219
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,479
Yeah. That's why we have this uh

220
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,160
cholesterol 911.com campaign. I'm not

221
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,280
selling anything. I'm not a reverse

222
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,759
mortgage guy. I I'm here to screw your

223
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,840
grandmother out of her house. No. I

224
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,240
mean, it's not it. All it is is it's

225
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,680
just a campaign to make people aware

226
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,599
because we've lost so many. Well, I'll

227
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
tell you a funny end of that Rodney

228
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,400
story. Rodney eventually passed away

229
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,479
about six years later and I went to see

230
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,639
Rodney in the hospital and he was in a

231
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,560
coma and his wife Joan who was just a

232
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,960
great lady. She said, you know, Rodney

233
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,039
said, "I think he can hear us but he

234
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,120
can't respond." I was so talking to

235
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,120
Rodney and Rodney was lying like this

236
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
and and and Joan said, "Jay, put your

237
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,759
finger in Rodney's hand." And she said,

238
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,000
"Rodney, if you know it's Jay, squeeze

239
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,399
his finger." So I felt him squeeze my

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,880
finger and I said, "Rodney, that's not

241
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,880
my finger."

242
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:41,919
So,

243
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,640
so yeah. So, but he went like this. I

244
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,839
mean, he moved, you know. No, no, he

245
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,120
did. He did. And And the funny part was

246
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,200
he he went like that and I thought, "Oh,

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
I made him kind of laugh when he coma."

248
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,560
I mean, I cured him. I mean, I I know it

249
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,399
sound I don't mean to sound mean as

250
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,080
dumb, but it's just when you're a comic,

251
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,800
you know, you make one of your idols

252
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,880
who's in a coma laugh. And I and Joan

253
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,320
thought it was funny and I I hope Rodney

254
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,480
thought it was I mean he passed away

255
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
soon after that but it was just a great

256
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,000
moment you know with one of my heroes

257
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,040
with one of my friends it's on my

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,959
finger. Yeah. We come back more with the

259
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,000
hysterical Jay Leno and his advice for

260
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,839
all of you at home.

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,160
I'm back with late night superstar Jay

262
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,040
Lento who is somehow making cholesterol

263
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,800
and health funny. All right, let me show

264
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,480
you. I got a little surprise for you

265
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,720
guys. Bring it out here. You know, a lot

266
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
of people give their guests fun prizes.

267
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,760
I like to do it quite this way. So,

268
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,680
here's You'll find out. Put the purple

269
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,160
gloves on. Why you gloves on? Put the

270
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,440
pal gloves on. So, I thought I'd uh This

271
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,440
is not a rectal thing, is it? No.

272
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,160
I mean, I see this show. I don't know. I

273
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,600
never know where it's going. So, I need

274
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,920
both of them on. You need both of them

275
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,519
on. So, I brought you a human heart. Oh,

276
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,959
you know, I I understand they taste like

277
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,160
chicken. Is that correct? Yes, they

278
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,920
taste like chicken. Well, thank you. But

279
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,200
I want because you're taking time talk

280
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,320
about cholesterol. That's an actual

281
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,680
human heart. Yeah. Now, I want you to

282
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
just hold. Now, I hope some guy isn't

283
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
waiting for a transplant and this you

284
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,080
stop.

285
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Cuz some somewhere in a hospital open

286
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,519
the beer cooler. It's got beer in it.

287
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,279
Where's the heart? What happened to the

288
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,800
heart? Leno's got it. Leno has it. So,

289
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,440
this is a real heart. This is the heart

290
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,680
here. Okay. And this is the aorta. And

291
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,519
I'm just pointing out You see how it's

292
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,680
like crispy like potato chips here?

293
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay. Yourself. So, I've got a heart on,

294
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,000
you might say.

295
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,160
Sorry. I'm sorry. Don't be here all

296
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,959
week. I'm sorry. I I like it.

297
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm sorry. I I couldn't resist You

298
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,000
know, this is fascinating. I've never I

299
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,079
you know, never held a human heart. And

300
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,320
this is This looks like a pretty flimsy

301
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,920
mechanism, doesn't it? This is why we

302
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,200
need to take care of it. So, but feel

303
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,880
see these little plaques here? These

304
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,240
are, you know, aorta chips. Basically,

305
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,560
you don't want that too much. They're

306
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,600
delicious. Yeah. But that's the

307
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,040
cholesterol you're talking about. Those

308
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
are what cholesterol plaques look like.

309
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, okay. Wow. All right. So, there you

310
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,920
go. Well, since your heart is in cars.

311
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
Yes. I built you something just for you.

312
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
You made something for me? Yeah. A

313
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
little heart model that's based on cars.

314
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,519
Are you okay? Well, you gave me a human

315
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,040
heart. I don't know what else you could

316
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,480
give me. This is going to top that.

317
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,160
Bring it out, guys. Bring it out. What

318
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,160
do we have here? We have a

319
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,760
racetrack. All right. Now, this is

320
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,120
something special.

321
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,560
Thank you very much. All right. So now

322
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,399
I'm no expert. If it looks like a

323
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,880
modified Hot Wheel set, maybe

324
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:37,279
I'm No. I've got two cars here. This is

325
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,079
a normal racetrack. Notice how thin

326
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,839
these linings are. Nothing corroding it,

327
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,000
messing it up. Right now, I got a little

328
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,360
car in here. Now, watch this. If there's

329
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,240
no blockages here, the heart moves

330
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,519
really quickly with the blood. All the

331
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
blood flows through there. Let's put

332
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,880
that in slow-mo because I think Jay

333
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,399
missed that. So fast. That's how fast

334
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,079
the heart is able to pump blood through

335
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
itself. There you go. Oh, there it is.

336
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,600
Now, this is what happens in that plaque

337
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,200
heart that I just showed you earlier.

338
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,040
So, when you put rocks in the road, I'm

339
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,000
guessing it could be a problem. Yeah.

340
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,560
Yeah. In fact, oh, what are the odds of

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,240
that? God, who? Go figure. This is why

342
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,880
you got to focus on your LDL

343
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,480
cholesterol. It matters. Well, the funny

344
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,920
thing, you know, there's no symptom to

345
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,680
it. That's the thing that's weird about

346
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,839
it cuz I have a friend of mine. He's a

347
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,399
jogger. He runs three miles every day

348
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,800
and he had a stroke and he's furious

349
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
that I'm sitting home watching Dr. Oz

350
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,560
and the Today Show and I'm not doing

351
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,200
anything. I'm eating bon bonss and and
