1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,720
Today we're showing you how to make 2019

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,560
your most successful year yet. And we

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,720
have two sharks here to show you their

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,559
tricks to make a million dollars.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,800
They're the same tricks that help my

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,599
next guests go from broke dreamers to

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,520
millionaire mogul. Please welcome star

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,240
the stars of the sharks, Barbara Corkran

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,240
and Rohan Ozak.

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:26,199
[Applause]

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,480
I am so happy you are here. Nice to see

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,600
you. Nice to see you. Roan, how are you?

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,200
This side, right. Pleasure. Good to see

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480
you again, my friend. So, these guys, by

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,320
the way, they were both wildly

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,760
successful, right? But didn't start that

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,120
way. And if I just share a little

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,000
something about you because I'm Why not?

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,160
You're going to share it anyway.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,520
Exactly. These are sharable items. So,

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,879
it went from having a thousand bucks

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,079
turned into a million dollars. But on

23
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,360
the way, you had 23 jobs. You got fired

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,640
from three of them. You had to bring

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,239
that up. I wanted to bring that up

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,000
because you can do it, right? What got

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,600
you motivated to get back on your horse,

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
fix your finances, and become the person

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,719
you are? Well, being fired is a great

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,480
motivator because you don't have a job

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,879
and I needed the money. So, I had to get

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,640
another job. But more much more

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,119
important than that is the boss did for

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,880
me what I couldn't do for myself, which

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,479
was move off of what I didn't do well

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
and find something that I could really

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,000
do well. Well, find your strength. It's

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,159
a gift. It's a gift when you get over

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,360
the shame. So, Rohan and Barbara are

40
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,799
going to show you three tricks we can

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,720
all use today to get us on the

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,920
millionaire path. Is that true? Yeah.

43
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,720
You say so. Trick number one is to

44
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,159
increase your stream of

45
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,920
incomes. Akila is here. She has a good

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,680
job. Always feels like she's a little

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,520
underwater despite that and that your

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,000
financially can't get ahead. Difficulty

49
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,240
staying afloat with financially, you

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,280
know. And you like the job. Um I like

51
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,960
working. Yes. Okay. It's close. So

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,920
explain to Kila. I'd love to know the

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,240
difference between the two at some

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,479
point. Maybe not enough time today. Why

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,560
is watching that your income or changing

56
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,479
your income stream so important? I think

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,680
people get stuck on one income stream

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,960
and I think you're going to demonstrate

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,079
this. Aren't you going to pour it in?

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,920
Are you going to pour it on? Actually,

61
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,520
go ahead. No, no, you do it. So, you're

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
making your job from a job we think you

63
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,040
like. We're not sure. And this is your

64
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
budget. This is your budget. You've got

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,560
one bucket. You're trying to fill it up.

66
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,080
It's going to take you a long time. If

67
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,599
you had two or three buckets and they're

68
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,920
all pouring together, you would fill

69
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,440
this up. Considering picturing as a

70
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,879
money bank. Oh, here's another one. So,

71
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,040
let's say you have a home rental

72
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,120
business for example, right? Pour that

73
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,200
in there. Right. And you want me to

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,640
That's all. I'll be the home rental

75
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,640
income. This is Airbnb being your place.

76
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,400
You're selling old stuff. You're putting

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
it in there. I'm renting out that

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,959
million dollar property I have. Can I

79
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,560
tell you online store? You could do so

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,480
many things. The idea is you don't get

81
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,720
stuck thinking you're one person doing

82
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,200
one thing. You could buy the the

83
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,599
terrible house next to you, fix it up,

84
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,599
make it better. Oh, I think you talked

85
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,440
the points. Okay. Well, no. I look at

86
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,360
this now seriously, you have your main

87
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,480
income, right? And then you add all

88
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,160
these other streams, which you point out

89
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,840
is a very important observation. You can

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,440
change the size of these, but you're

91
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,800
ultimately floating yourself back up to

92
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,280
being on a budget that you want to live

93
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,120
on. Are there any side hustles that you

94
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,680
might be able to get behind? I mean, we

95
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,840
have great family recipes and I'm I

96
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,239
mean, I'm pretty good cook so I

97
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,400
sometimes cater. more and more people

98
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,480
don't have time to cook at home and but

99
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,640
they want healthier foods and you can't

100
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,159
find them and that a lot of big

101
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,599
companies have exploded with home

102
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,760
delivery but if you can do it just in

103
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,120
your neighborhood that alone is a great

104
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,360
healthier foods are really big deal to

105
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,319
me it's right up my alley I was 340 lb

106
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,920
before you were 340 lb and now I'm okay

107
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,799
that's the story that's like three of

108
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,799
these together you have a story I mean

109
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,519
you you yourself have lost that weight

110
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,519
you've made yourself healthier Mhm. He's

111
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,920
going to fund you. Wonderful. All right.

112
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,000
Come on over. Was it a pitch? Was that a

113
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,319
pitch? I don't know. All right. The next

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
trick to making a million dollars is not

115
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,879
to wait to automate. So, if you guys can

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,319
stand right there, got a little

117
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
experiment. Yes. Because this young

118
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,560
woman, Juju, is uh going to want to

119
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,239
learn a bit from you. So, you have we

120
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,360
have a mentality issue here, right? Yes.

121
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,640
So, what do you do with the money that

122
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,519
you make? I try to save it. Try to save

123
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,200
it. Yeah. Or spend it because it's all

124
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
over the place. It's hard to do that,

125
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,920
isn't it? put the money aside, which is

126
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,519
probably the biggest problem we have in

127
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,760
America. So, Ran, how do you use this

128
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,560
mentality to make to make millions? So,

129
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,919
first of all, start by pretending that

130
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,120
you only make 80% of your paycheck. It's

131
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,199
like change your mindset. So, 20%

132
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,040
automate goes away. Pretend like it's

133
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
the tax man. You can't get it back.

134
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,440
Okay? 10 years later, that's going to

135
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,000
pile up to a ton of money. May not even

136
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,840
take 10 years, even five years. Now, you

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
have a war chest that you can start

138
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,199
investing with. So let's look at what

139
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,360
Rohan means. This is a really important

140
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,400
principle. So to make it come alive, I'm

141
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,080
going to ask you to step into this phone

142
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,199
booth for a second. Okay? And you see

143
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,800
all the money on the ground there,

144
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,199
right? Yes. It could be yours. Let's

145
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,600
just say your budget

146
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,919
would mean that you could put aside $100

147
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
a month. That's $1,200 a year. All

148
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,280
right. So when I turn this on, I just

149
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,479
want you to behave like you're in real

150
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,759
life because that's what real life is

151
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,320
like with money flying around. And I

152
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,840
just want you to grab at $100 a month or

153
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,360
$1,200. You ready to go? Turn it on,

154
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,240
guys. Okay. Grab it. I want to be Go

155
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,880
ahead and grab it. You're on. Good. Good

156
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,520
work. That's it. Good job. All right.

157
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,479
All right. Stop. All right. What do we

158
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,400
have? The year is over. The year's over.

159
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,720
Let's just see what she was able to hold

160
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,840
on to. Okay. Do these count? No, they

161
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,199
don't count. Oh, they definitely That's

162
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,120
exactly the point. They don't count cuz

163
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,039
they slipped out of her fingers. How

164
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,639
much you have there? Let's see. 600.

165
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,360
Less than that. Okay. So, here's the

166
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,039
thing. If you have an automated system

167
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,039
and let's say I'm the automator, right?

168
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm the bank and I you just give me $100

169
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,039
a month. The $1,200 gets just put in

170
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,520
your hand right there. It's done. It's

171
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,960
finished. Boom. You automated it. It's

172
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,720
stress free to automate it. And more

173
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,680
importantly, when I put $1,200 in your

174
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,840
hands, it reduces your stress. Half the

175
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,000
people in the country don't have $400 in

176
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,680
an emergency, right? That takes a lot of

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,639
pressure on to live your life. That was

178
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,240
stressful. But you struggle. You saw the

179
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,560
stress. You automate it. You take that

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,520
30%. Don't spend it all at once. Okay.

181
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,600
Okay. Come on over, guys. The next trick

182
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,120
to make a million dollars is to make

183
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,560
friends that make money move. Make

184
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,080
friends that make money move. We're put

185
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,080
a little pop music in this deal. Oh,

186
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,919
cool. We dance. We dance to it, right?

187
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,919
But is that the same as networking? No.

188
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,600
Networking is so overrated. I think of

189
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,199
networking as walking to a room,

190
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,680
collecting business cards, handing out

191
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,240
your cards. Wrong way to go. I think the

192
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
key to building wealth is surrounding

193
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,479
yourself with people within your circle

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,800
of influence. People you have some

195
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,880
contact with that have a talent that you

196
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,560
don't have. I know when I started my

197
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,240
business, I was well organized, couldn't

198
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,840
afford an accountant, so I organized his

199
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
office every week and he did my

200
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,199
accounting for free. You don't need

201
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,199
money to find talent. Find the people

202
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,840
who are good at it and join forces.

203
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,520
That's how people get rich. You want to

204
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,199
try this little experiment here? Little

205
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,560
social experiment. Abigail, come on in

206
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,560
if you don't mind. So, I met Abigail

207
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,280
just before the show. Come on in. My

208
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,120
sharks here. So, don't be scared of them

209
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,360
because stand right there. They do.

210
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,960
Don't be shy. Do be scared of Bobra. I'm

211
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,800
fine.

212
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,720
They can both be sharks. I've seen them.

213
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,080
All right. So, uh you're one month in

214
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
launching a company. Yes. Correct. So,

215
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,919
tell us a little bit about what you're

216
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,840
up to. So, my company, Socktorius, is a

217
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,520
sock line that we launched. I want to

218
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,240
have a product that was in line with my

219
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,039
core values to inspire, to motivate. So,

220
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,319
our socks are beautifully created with

221
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,400
You have them. Oh, you have them on.

222
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,039
Yes. Smart to wear them. Yes. So, what's

223
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,360
the problem? So, the problem is that we

224
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,840
How do I get this out to the American

225
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,520
public? How do I get the sock into the

226
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
hands of America with knowing that these

227
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,599
socks have hashtags on it that

228
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,440
motivational hashtags that no excuses?

229
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,039
So, you know, remind you to go ask for

230
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,400
that raise. All right. So, let's take

231
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,000
that. So, we we're all family here at

232
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,840
the show. Yes. So, who might have a

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,599
skill set to help publicize a new

234
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,199
company? Right there. Got one. Here.

235
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,199
Come on up here. Number two up here.

236
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,400
What's your name? Alisa. I'm hiding

237
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,879
number two. Alisa, you can stand next to

238
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,000
me. Safer. Okay. So, Alisa, you just

239
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,639
heard the idea. What do you do for a

240
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,479
living? I have my own PR company. There

241
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,960
we go. And what do you So, someone you

242
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,400
trade, right? So, you got to do back. I

243
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,000
would love some socks. I mean, that's

244
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,240
Those are awesome socks, which would

245
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,240
totally look cute with my boots, too.

246
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,840
Yeah. Okay. So, I'll tell you what we'll

247
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
do. I'm going to give you guys a little

248
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,039
gift. I want you to go out to lunch on

249
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,639
me. Oh, wow. Work it out. Tell me what

250
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,240
you figure out and just be an example

251
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,520
for the rest of the country. I have a

252
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
brilliant idea. If you got to clean

253
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,200
someone's office to get them to chip in

254
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,959
and that which is really what will make

255
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
you wealthy to hang with people who can

256
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,800
move money, you should do it. Yeah. God

257
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,560
bless you. Good luck with Storius. Thank

258
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,080
