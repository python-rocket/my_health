00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,920
Today on Oz, he is a notorious online

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,759
fat shamer bullying women.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,240
>> These are posts you have. Men would

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,679
rather die than sleep with a woman over

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,839
150 lbs. Women were getting larger and

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,680
larger. It has to be stopped.

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,760
>> Dr. Oz fights back.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,720
>> Fat shaming doesn't work. That's the big

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
message here.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,480
>> The women he attacks sound off.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,760
>> You don't know me.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,840
>> Oz faces off. Coming up next on Dr. Oz.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
There are monsters that lurk in the

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,079
shadows of the internet, shaming and

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,760
bullying people for the way they look.

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,280
It's time for them to come out from

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,760
behind their computer screens. Meet Roo

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,480
V. Now, he calls himself the leader of

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,960
the international fat shaming movement.

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,680
His goal to encourage others to join him

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,520
in publicly humiliating women for their

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,399
weight as a way to force them to conform

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,000
to his idea of beauty. The internet

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,320
makes it much easier than ever for

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,960
bullies to hide, but I'm not letting

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,680
them hide anymore.

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
Celebrities under fire. Kelly Clarkson

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,200
attacked on Twitter a year after giving

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,240
birth. Comedian Amy Schumer mocked by

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,040
web trolls for her weight. Now everyday

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,680
people targeted by fat bullies like

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,799
Shawn internationally humiliated for

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,840
simply dancing in public. All for body

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,159
shape and size. The internet's a

35
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,520
playground for fat shamers, and it's

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,240
getting much darker. Roo Valizad uses

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,799
the pseudonym Rou Fork to proclaim

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,920
himself a fat shaming activist and

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,560
organizer. So incendiary, he's on watch

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,479
list for embodying the dark underbelly

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,000
of the internet, full of venom and

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:52,240
vitriol. Rou claims men would rather die

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,439
than have sex with a woman over 150 lbs.

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,159
He has even declared jihad on fat women.

45
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,240
His mission, quote, to make it more

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,520
acceptable to shame, bully, and

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,920
humiliate fat women into thinness.

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,879
Now, he's calling for a worldwide fat

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,440
shaming movement, rallying his followers

50
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,000
to snap photos every time you see a girl

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,360
with a bit of muffin top and post them

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,520
to Twitter. Today, we unmask one of the

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,080
internet's most notorious body bullies.

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,640
Roo Valizad who goes by Roov V has

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,720
agreed to join us in studio. So if you

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
can explain the purpose of this fat

57
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,360
shaming movement. What's the intent?

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,920
>> Sure. Right now the intent is a reaction

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,280
to the fact that in the past 30 or 40

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,280
years people in the USA have increased

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,680
their size to such a point where

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,800
twothirds of people here are overweight.

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,000
Um, I think that fat shaming actually

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,440
will reduce the health concerns, the

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
health problems that people face right

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,080
now.

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,599
>> Yeah, I I I I don't I disagree and we'll

68
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,879
come back to that, but let me just so

69
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,400
people understand what you're doing,

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,080
just read some stuff. These are posts

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
you have and this is mater I think it's

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,920
hateful material personally. Uh, you

73
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,200
know, people hear what you say, but now

74
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,319
that you're not hiding behind your

75
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
computer, let's have an honest

76
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
conversation.

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,560
>> I do not hide. My name is out there. you

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,120
see me on on the internet. I do YouTube

79
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,519
videos. So I I don't hide. So I don't

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,519
want people to to think that.

81
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,000
>> Here's one statement. Men would rather

82
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,239
die than sleep with a woman over 150

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,319
pounds. How can you speak for all men

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,920
saying that?

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,120
For the men that I have met, men who are

86
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,879
thin, who go to the gym three times a

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:47,519
week, who lift, who exercise right, who

88
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:50,640
have good jobs, they do not want to date

89
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,560
a woman who is massively overweight

90
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,000
compared to a thin woman.

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,760
>> I'll speak just for myself, but I mean,

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,040
I work out three times a week. I do what

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,799
I can to stay healthy.

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,480
>> I love women whatever shape they're in.

95
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,000
It doesn't frankly matter to me what's

96
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,640
on the outside. It's a much deeper issue

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,480
that I'm searching for.

98
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,000
>> But you but you have to say that because

99
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,479
you have millions of viewers. I think I

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,479
am speaking in a way that men speak with

101
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,519
each other in the locker rooms.

102
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,720
>> You're in different locker rooms than

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,639
me, Rouge. And I'm not saying that

104
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,080
because I'm on the show. I'm on the show

105
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,479
because I believe that

106
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,840
>> if you were given an option between a

107
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:34,880
woman who is 300 lb and a woman who is

108
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,040
125 lb and all else is is is equal.

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,240
Would you honestly pick the woman who is

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,080
300 lb?

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,520
>> If you know first of all saying all else

112
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,440
is equal is a very difficult thing to

113
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,040
process. People learn through the

114
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,800
messiness of life.

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
>> I'm fascinated by people who are

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,759
overweight. I'm fascinating people who

117
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
are underweight and everyone in between

118
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,000
because we all bring less lessons of

119
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,440
life and if we listen to those stories

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,280
because the people in our life define

121
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,560
who we are that we learn from all of

122
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,919
them. On the other hand, here's your

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
comment on beauty since you brought it

124
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,600
up. Again, I'm quoting from your

125
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
website. Beauty on the inside. That's

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,479
just something that ugly people and

127
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,199
feminists say. You use such ugly words

128
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,560
to describe beauty. I mean, have have

129
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,440
you ever had a weight problem?

130
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,880
>> No.

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,039
>> So, how can you understand what they're

132
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,520
feeling? Because

133
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,759
how someone looks on the outside is

134
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,440
indicative of how they are on the

135
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,639
inside. If someone doesn't have the self

136
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,520
the self-control to exercise, to watch

137
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,639
how they how they eat. If they're big on

138
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,639
on on the outside, that is a sign that

139
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,960
there is probably some problems on the

140
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,759
inside.

141
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,680
>> Roo, we're all messed up.

142
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
>> If you can hear my voice, you're messed

143
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,080
up. That's who we are.

144
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,840
>> That's your opinion.

145
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,039
>> All right. Now, but but part of this but

146
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,919
but you fat shame men too.

147
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,199
>> We the first thing I tell men who come

148
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,840
to me when they want to increase their s

149
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,960
their their success in life is to hit

150
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,479
the gym. I have caused thousands of men

151
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,639
to eat right to go to the fat. So yes,

152
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,639
>> men they don't they respond to logic. If

153
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,319
you tell a man

154
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,039
>> in a faster way, if you tell a man that

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,919
if you're thin, if your muscles look

156
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,960
good, more woman, more women will be

157
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,560
attracted to you, they will sign up for

158
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,160
a gym membership in a day. Rouge, what

159
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,360
do the women in your life think about

160
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
what you're doing? What's your

161
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,919
relationship with them? Your mom,

162
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
sisters, cousins.

163
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,919
>> They love me for who I am. They don't

164
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,039
love me for the ideas. The ideas that I

165
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,000
push concerns dating between women and

166
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,680
men. I'm just stating a simple fact that

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,880
men like women who are thin.

168
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
I'm asking these questions cuz I'm

169
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
trying to figure out why you're so

170
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,440
screwed up.

171
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,199
>> Okay.

172
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,560
I mean, we're talking about fat shaming

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,639
and that's what you're responding to.

174
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,919
I'm trying to diagnose you. Let me just

175
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,520
go a second. You you've mentioned

176
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,440
several times that you're doing this for

177
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,479
altruistic reasons that you want to help

178
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,280
women and men

179
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,720
>> and men lose weight, right? I just did a

180
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,000
quick search. I knew you were coming on

181
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,280
this week. I actually went through these

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,160
papers. 50 papers. 50 papers. Here they

183
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,479
are.

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
>> 50 papers showing that fat shaming

185
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,039
doesn't work. It's the exact opposite.

186
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,560
What happens is when you fat shame

187
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,880
people, they feel worse about

188
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,720
themselves. Their self-esteem drops and

189
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,319
then they eat to comfort themselves.

190
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,479
What does work is making people realize

191
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,280
how special they are. That's the big

192
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,919
message here.

193
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,400
>> Does it does it work? Now, I I I haven't

194
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,360
seen that, but does the tips that you

195
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,919
share, the advice that you share, is it

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,240
is it helping? Because I see the obesity

197
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,360
epidemic is growing. So, what you are

198
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,400
doing, what good intentioned doctors are

199
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,039
doing doesn't work. So, we need to try

200
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,560
something else. And I believe shaming,

201
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,960
making a girl embarrassed to look the

202
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,680
way that she does

203
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,639
will help more than you giving a tip to

204
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,759
eat eat right.

205
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,440
>> You know, I'm not even going to have a

206
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,639
debate. Here are the papers. You go home

207
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,000
with the opportunity.

208
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,160
>> You don't have to read them. You won't

209
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,919
find a single paper that argues in your

210
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,520
favor. In fact, I couldn't find a single

211
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,039
person who watches the show who agree

212
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,400
with what you're saying. Not one. Just

213
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,919
give me one person in the audience now

214
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,479
who thinks that if I make you ashamed of

215
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,759
who you are, you'll lose weight. It's

216
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,280
not going to happen. I'm looking around.

217
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,400
I see no hands. This is a sampling of

218
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,840
200. What is it that made you get up one

219
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,760
day and say, "You know what? I'm going

220
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
to put out hateful fat shaming

221
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,800
messages."

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,800
>> I don't think that it is hateful, but I

223
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,560
will say that it was it was sad that

224
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,320
every year when me, a a straight man,

225
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,040
would have less options to date a thin

226
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,760
beautiful girl. Every year women were

227
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,920
getting larger and larger. It has to be

228
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,800
stopped in some way. I'm on the same

229
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,200
team as you. We just use different

230
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,480
medicine.

231
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,279
>> We're not on the same team at all.

232
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,680
Believe me, we you're on my team. We're

233
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,600
ending the game. What angers me the most

234
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,760
is that Roo is up in the ante by

235
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,839
encouraging others to take and post

236
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,519
pictures of women that they see who have

237
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,920
quote I'm giving this is your quote. A

238
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,040
bit of muffin top, bingo wings or

239
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,200
cankles.

240
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,200
>> Now I know how painful this is. So, I

241
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
found a picture on Twitter for one of

242
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,560
your followers, heavily blurted out cuz

243
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,480
I want to protect this woman. Here's

244
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
what the tweet says. This is what you're

245
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,600
proposing and supporting. Here's the

246
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,000
tweet. Fat pig pulls in front of me a

247
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,959
gas station and cuts off my exit and

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,120
blocks people on the right. I mean, what

249
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,519
do you say to women who are being

250
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,240
publicly violated in this way by

251
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,399
complete strangers who follow you? I

252
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,519
think we each thankfully we each have

253
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,680
the right to share our thoughts, our

254
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,600
opinions. If your feelings are hurt, you

255
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,760
know, I can't help that. But everyone

256
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,480
here has the capability to say something

257
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,519
to me which will hurt me as well. And

258
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,839
that's their right.

259
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,240
>> Mankind is your business.

260
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,760
>> Mankind is your business. The It's not

261
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,080
about a law. You can't legislate

262
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,080
morality or ethics or kindness. What

263
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,760
keeps all of us spinning on this globe

264
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,440
is because we have empathy for each

265
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,640
other. I wish I could scan your brain to

266
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
understand what's happening inside there

267
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,240
because there are pieces that are

268
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,079
missing and it's not even rational what

269
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm hearing now. I said a lot. I want to

270
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,760
ask an audience members and so when we

271
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
come back some women in my audience have

272
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,040
a message for Roo.

273
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,480
Coming up next, Dr. Oz continues his

274
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
face off with the leader of the

275
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,399
international fat shaming movement,

276
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,399
bullying women all over the world on the

277
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,240
internet. What our audience has to say

278
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,079
to the notorious fat shamer.

279
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,399
>> You don't know what I do. Coming up

280
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,200
next, all new Oz.

281
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,040
>> Come on.

282
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,760
>> How road rage can wreck your health.

283
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,160
>> My heart rate jumped from 50 beats to 88

284
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,360
beats a minute. Plus, country music star

285
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,560
Tim McGra's mission to help save lives.

286
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,480
That's coming up tomorrow on Dr. Oz.

287
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,079
>> We're back talking with Rou who calls

288
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
himself the leader of the international

289
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,399
fat shaming movement. Please welcome

290
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,399
Janette, Erina, and Megan who've all

291
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
faced fat shaming in their own lives and

292
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,079
they're here to speak with you. I want

293
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,680
you to just process what they're saying.

294
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,160
Janette, what angers you the most about

295
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,360
some of these posts that you're seeing.

296
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,279
>> First thing, you're very disrespectful.

297
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,120
You're more It's morally wrong to make

298
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,360
fun of other people. I was one of the

299
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,440
people that was fat shamed. I went to a

300
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,320
bar a few months ago. Two guys taking

301
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,279
pictures behind me laughing. And guess

302
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,120
what I did? It doesn't hurt my feelings.

303
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,200
I turned around and let them have it.

304
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,560
Because after 40 years of dealing with

305
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,079
people like you, I what I there's no

306
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,680
we're done. We're done. We exist. We're

307
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,320
here.

308
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,800
And not only that, you don't know me. I

309
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,880
have a nutritionist. I am glutenree, fat

310
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,480
free, sugar free. You don't know what I

311
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,160
do. And I'm a mother and a teacher. And

312
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,720
I have to take care of the children that

313
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,720
you're messing up.

314
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,880
early enough.

315
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,440
>> Absolutely.

316
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Absolutely. Um the articles, everything

317
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,440
that you're saying, it just it just

318
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,920
makes me livid. Like just seriously

319
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,600
angry because you don't know again what

320
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,760
people have to go through in their

321
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,760
regular lives. I argue, you know, what

322
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,600
did you go through in your life? Like

323
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,760
seriously, like is, you know, cuz I I

324
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,320
what I see is low self-esteem. I see

325
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,399
help self-hatred. I see that you know

326
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,240
you're struggling because one thing I do

327
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,720
know and I know for sure is that hurt

328
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,079
people they hurt other people. It's a

329
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,160
shame. It's a fat shame actually. It's a

330
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,399
fat shame that you think that this is

331
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,959
going to help um help the community.

332
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,399
It's not. There are children who are who

333
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,079
are struggling with obesity. Are you

334
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,160
want to are you do you prep are you

335
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,320
prepared to fat shame them as well?

336
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,399
That's it's it's absolutely it's

337
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,079
absolutely ridiculous.

338
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,040
>> Okay. Let me just get Megan in and I

339
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,399
want you to respond to all of them.

340
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,560
Sure. Megan, please.

341
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,240
>> Hey Rou, we must make you very

342
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,279
uncomfortable.

343
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,480
>> We are strong, confident, successful,

344
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,320
beautiful plus-size women, and we must

345
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
make you very uncomfortable. So, I'm

346
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,920
sorry for that if I'm making you

347
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,160
uncomfortable right now. But when I read

348
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,160
your website and I read what you do and

349
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,120
I see what your followers and your

350
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,279
leaders and your army does, I feel sad.

351
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,519
I feel sad for you and I feel sad for

352
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,760
them because in an industry where we are

353
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,240
finally taking the right steps to get

354
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,079
body acceptance and self-love, something

355
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,000
that's universal,

356
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,160
what you are doing is taking 10 steps

357
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,160
back because fat shaming someone and

358
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,839
making someone feel bad about themselves

359
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,160
is actually only turning the mirror

360
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:47,120
around on you. Okay, Roo,

361
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,920
>> this is going to be the first generation

362
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,760
where the life expectancy is shorter

363
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,120
than that of our parents and

364
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,240
grandparents. So wait, wait, please,

365
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,839
please, please.

366
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,680
>> So therefore, the kids that you you have

367
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,399
will see her mom for a shorter time

368
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,680
because the fat problem is un is

369
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,800
unsolved. If it were a health,

370
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,079
>> it's a health issue, but not the way

371
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,920
you're describing it. what you're

372
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,720
hearing from these beautiful women and

373
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,800
you are beautiful.

374
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,360
>> You are picking out the most extreme

375
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,440
things I've written. I mean, you you

376
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,519
haven't picked out how I'm teaching men

377
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,760
to go to the gym and eat right.

378
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,000
>> Rou, what you're saying at its very core

379
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,000
is wrong. And when people think that

380
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,720
embarrassing others gets them to change,

381
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,680
it means they don't know about people.

382
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,279
So, you know, I've had a very difficult

383
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
time sitting here letting you speak on

384
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,560
my stage.

385
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
>> Okay.

386
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,320
>> Uh, it is, I think, enough. Um,

387
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,600
certainly you're out there on the web

388
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,279
everywhere, but it's enough of my

389
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,920
audience to be able to tolerate this.

390
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,880
So, I'm going to ask if I can Jima,

391
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,399
you're a plus-size model.

392
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,480
You're trying to change the face of

393
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,079
beauty and you wanted to be here today.

394
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,120
So, the platform is yours. What do you

395
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,600
want to say to Roo?

396
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,360
>> Hi, Dr. Oz, and thank you for giving me

397
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,920
this opportunity to be here. And Roo,

398
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,519
um, I'm going to take the approach of

399
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,279
treating you like a human being because

400
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,959
you don't view me as that. um you and I

401
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,279
quote stated that um someone's weight or

402
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,199
the outward appearance is an indicator

403
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,399
of their character.

404
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,839
So because you're slim built and I read

405
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,440
a lot of the things you said, I'm going

406
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:29,839
to say your character is that of a jerk.

407
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,199
Okay? And I normally don't judge by mere

408
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,800
appearance, but that's what you do. So

409
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,199
I'm going to meet you at your level,

410
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,560
okay? And I want you to look at me. I

411
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,000
want you to look at me because I am

412
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,320
human. I have feelings. And I speak for

413
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,920
the plus-sized community. We're not

414
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,839
saying, and we're not disagreeing with

415
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,839
you, that we shouldn't take care of

416
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,920
ourselves. We're not saying that we

417
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,000
shouldn't um acquire a healthier

418
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,120
lifestyle. We're not discrediting that

419
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,480
at all. We're saying to accept yourself

420
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,240
who you are today. In 5 months or 10

421
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,519
months, you may be a different person,

422
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,959
but does that mean that you don't

423
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,519
deserve love? Does that mean you have

424
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,759
the right to judge me? and ridicule me

425
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,040
because I'm a size 12. Does that mean

426
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm ugly? No. Beauty comes from within.

427
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,480
And I am not insecure. As a matter of

428
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,720
fact, I'm one of the most confident

429
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,199
people you will ever meet. Again, look

430
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,320
at me.

431
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,240
>> Can I say one more thing?

432
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,959
>> Yes. But I I I what I want you to

433
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,199
address,

434
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,240
>> please. Instead of hiding behind

435
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,759
>> fictional beliefs, false beliefs, what I

436
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,199
want you to address is whether you're

437
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,800
willing to rethink fat shaming.

438
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:40,079
>> As long as they are willing to accept

439
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,320
that fat acceptance is going to cause

440
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,920
additional health problems for millions

441
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:49,120
of people and shorten lifespans, then I

442
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,199
would also think about the feelings that

443
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,360
I am hurting. Roo, you I think you got a

444
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,279
complete ass backwards.

445
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,519
The way the way we get wonderful people

446
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,360
to be who they want to be is get them to

447
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,400
accept themselves and the weight will

448
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,480
come off. I believe that the reason we

449
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,079
hold on to so much fat is because it

450
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,480
protects us. And if you're attacking

451
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,839
women and children and maybe men,

452
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,959
although I haven't seen the fat seaming

453
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,400
because I in my heart think you're

454
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,520
misogynist.

455
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,199
>> I I really don't think we're going to

456
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,640
get there. This is your homework. These

457
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,160
are all the papers. I pulled them for

458
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,400
you. They're on the web. You know,

459
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,600
you're what you owe me back for this

460
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,919
conversation because I'm trying to help

461
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,679
you is just go through and find one

462
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,120
supported bit of evidence. Now, in

463
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,960
addition, you're welcome to leave if you

464
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,280
want, but we spend a lot of time to

465
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,559
prepare something then stay because what

466
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,919
I'm trying to do, and this is for

467
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,960
everybody out right there. You know, I

468
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,799
because I do think you're the problem,

469
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,039
but I think it's fixable. At its very

470
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,679
core, folks, bullies try to steal your

471
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,360
power because they have none. So, I want

472
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,440
you to take back that power. I'm

473
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,360
starting today an army to change the

474
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,960
words so we can change the conversation.

475
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,520
You're going to watch a video. It's inc

476
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,120
I feel incredibly compelling. If you

477
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,160
feel like circulating it, do it. But at

478
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,960
least take it to heart. Watch.

479
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:07,039
>> Words matter. Don't call me fat.

480
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,720
>> Don't call me skinny.

481
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,559
>> Call us strong.

482
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,039
>> Don't judge me by what I look like on

483
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,440
the outside because I'm all about being

484
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,000
healthy on the inside. I don't go to the

485
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,840
gym to look good for other people. I do

486
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,679
it for myself.

487
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,120
>> Think before you call someone fat

488
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,679
because weight shaming doesn't make

489
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,679
anyone thinner. It just makes you small.

490
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,080
Start using body positive language about

491
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,960
yourself and others. Join the movement

492
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,350
and

493
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:40,080
>> be body positive.

>> Next, actress and Oscar nominee Lorraine

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,919
Broco. How her weight and depression

497
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,679
became her toughest role yet. The

498
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,640
turning point that changed everything.

500
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,880
can make it.

501

502
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,000
the best you can be. Next.

504
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,120
Serest. Wanted to say we love you and

505
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,799
thank you for always doing the radio

506

507
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,000

Lorraine Bronco. She's had an amazing

510
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,600
career from modeling, which I didn't

511
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,919
know she did, to her breakout role in

512
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,640
Good Fellas. I love that movie, and her

513
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,480
starring role in The Sopranos. But all

514
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,160
of her success didn't mean Lorraine was

515
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,400
happy. She found herself depressed,

516
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,400
overweight, and unhealthy. But now she's

517
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,799
fighting back, in great shape, and

518
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,590
feeling good. How did she do it? We're

519
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:51,509
about to find out. the rainco

531
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,440
weight have you lost? May I ask?

532

>> 35 lbs.

533

>> 35 lbs.

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,559
>> It's pretty cool.

535
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,480

about over a year.

health. I am intrigued by the title to

541
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,400
the Fullest. Could you, if you don't

542
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,000
mind, I'd love if you could explain why

543
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,799
you called it that.

544
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,799
>> Because I'm 60.

545
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,360
It's time to fill up.

546
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,159
>> And the truth of the matter is is I'm in

547
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:48,400
the third quarter of my life and I want

548
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,320
to live every day as strong and hard and

549
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,360
fun as I can make it.

550
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,240
>> And you're doing it.

551
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,200
>> I am.

552
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
>> Let me go back a little bit because

553
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,240
there have been times where it was more

554
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,679
difficult and we always celebrate

555
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,320
success, but we also want to figure out

556
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,000
how you got here. Your co-star in the

557
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,520
Sopranos, James Gandalfini. Yep.

558
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
>> When you lost him,

559
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,240
>> uh it was painful for everybody. How did

560
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,320
that affect this this journey you're on?

561
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,240
>> Well, the truth of the matter is is, you

562
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,559
know, Jimmy was always a big guy. He's

563
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,799
was 6'4. He's a he's a big man and um I

564
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,840
I remember this so well. We were on the

565
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,000
red carpet for something at HBO and I

566
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,400
hadn't seen him in a while and I grabbed

567
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,559
his belly and I was like, "You need to

568
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,039
get rid of this." And he was like, "Ah,

569
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,280
it's all muscle, Lori. It's all muscle

570
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,159
muscle." And I'm like, "No, you really

571
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,480
have to pay attention." And you know, we

572
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,159
we laughed about it and he says, "I'm

573
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,799
working on it. I'm working on it. I got

574
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:48,000
a home gym now." And and whatever. But

575
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,559
the you know, he was the thing that

576
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,880
killed me about Jimmy is besides loving

577
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,400
him and and thinking that he was the

578
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,280
greatest sparring partner I ever had,

579
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,880
um, he was a decade younger than me.

580
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,600
>> Yeah. a decade younger and I was like

581
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,640
wow if that can you know if if you can

582
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,039
pass like that in in a minute well then

583
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,000
it can happen to to me it can happen to

584
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,679
anybody

585
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,919
>> and a lot of times it's the sadness in

586
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,840
our lives that lead us to do things like

587
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,360
medicating with food you've had sad

588
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,360
times in your life if I could describe

589
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,799
some of the circumstances in the book

590
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,559
could you help everyone understand what

591
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,360
was going on as you gained weight as you

592
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,039
were doing the things that were

593
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,679
unhealthy for you

594
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:33,520
>> well you know my parents started started

595
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,080
to fail and they were both 84. There

596
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,240
>> they are.

597
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,880
>> And they were never healthy and they

598
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,760
never did anything that they should have

599
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,880
done uh o over the years. And I swore on

600
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,039
my life when we buried them that I was

601
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,600
going to do everything to get my health

602
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,799
back and I'm going to go down fighting.

603
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,360
>> Yeah. Come back for a second. I want to

604
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,720
take you a little journey.

605
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,159
Uh, this is a picture of you, a very

606
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,039
different version of Lorraine. When you

607
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,679
see this, Lorraine, you see this?

608
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,679
>> Yeah.

609
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,120
>> What's going on? Describe that person to

610
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,280
me.

611
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,240
>> Well, unaware.

612
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,039
>> Unaware.

613
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,240
>> Unaware of her health and her weight.

614
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,120
>> So, how did this woman become this

615
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
woman?

616
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,360
I

617
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,240
I wanted to live the third part of my

618
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,960
life in in a in a big way. Not in a

619
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,799
little way. Not in a sick way, not in a

620
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,080
in a way where where I didn't have any

621
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:40,799
energy. I'm I'm a grandmother.

622
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,600
>> Oh, I love that. I love that.

623
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,720
>> And I know you are also. And

624
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,760
>> I'm a grandfather.

625
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,000
>> Well, yes. Yes. I've noticed.

626
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,799
>> Come sit down. It feels good to be a

627
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,960
grandparent.

628
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,200
>> Yes, it's special. But boy, you got to

629
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,039
have energy for them.

630
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,520
>> That little thing is around the corner

631
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,200
and back before I can turn around.

632
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,799
>> So, you have lots of tips in the book.

633
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,960
Very helpful anti-aging tips, but the

634
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,640
one that really caught my eye was to

635
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,960
don't was to avoid being invisible. In

636
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,200
fact, the tip is don't be invisible.

637
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,840
Well, the truth of the matter is is I

638
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:18,799
think a lot of women who are 50 or or

639
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:23,039
older feel that

640
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,080
they're no longer as powerful as they

641
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,840
were.

642
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,279
>> And I happen to disagree with that

643
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,960
because I think we are smarter, wiser.

644
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,760
I think we should run the world.

645
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,000
I think

646
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,200
I mean

647
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,720
we are the caregivers of the world. We

648
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,440
are the the the ones that give birth. We

649
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,039
we do incredible things. And to get to a

650
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:55,440
certain age and I think menopause is is

651
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,200
is something that women dread. And I

652
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,760
don't think that should be dreaded. I

653
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,640
think it has to be embraced like like

654
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,520
everything God has given us.

655
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,520
>> So as all this emotion happens in our

656
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,440
lives, a lot of us turn to emotional

657
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,480
eating. You did. That's probably how you

658
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,080
got there. Sure.

659
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,000
>> How do you recover from that? It's not

660
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,760
just a long-term motivation. There

661
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,120
tactical things you have to deal with

662
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,520
when you want to overcome emotional

663
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
eating.

664
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,440
>> Okay. Here's my trick.

665
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,520
>> All right. Oh, pay attention now. The

666
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,000
trick for emotional eating. trick is is

667
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,159
I will look at a piece of cake that I

668
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,200
really, really, really want or I will

669
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,600
look at a bowl of berries and I will say

670
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,520
to myself, well, I really want that

671
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,320
piece of cake and I could eat that and I

672
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,200
could probably eat another piece after

673
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,679
that, but what are you going to give me?

674
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,480
Are you going to give me any nutritional

675
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,600
value? And the answer is most of the

676
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,200
time, no. I want that bag of potato

677
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,320
chips. I I really do. But you know what?

678
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,320
I look at my berries and I go, "Oo,

679
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,320
antioxidants."

680
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,480
>> They're whispering to you.

681
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,760
>> They they they talk to me.

682
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,320
>> She's the berry whisperer.

683
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,960
>> And And you know what? I make my

684
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,000
decisions that way. Now, listen. I'm I'm

685
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,720
not a crazy person. I still eat a lot of

686
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,640
things, but

687
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,760
I on a daily basis turn around and say

688
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,960
I'm gonna have a protein, a veggie, and

689
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,320
fruit.

690
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,640
>> And I'm proud of you. And you also like

691
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,400
to exercise. So, I've saved this for the

692
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,200
end. I want you to demonstrate exercise.

693
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,000
>> I never said I like it.

694
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
>> I misinterpreted.

695
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,600
>> No, no, let's get extreme.

696
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,440
>> I misqued the book.

697
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,400
Come on over here. Show me what you do.

698
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,120
You don't like it. What do you like?

699
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,520
Well, I like to move and I think moving

700
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,720
is important, especially if you want

701
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,799
energy. I want energy. That's my whole

702
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,559
thing. I'm taking my high heels off.

703
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,919
>> I like we can go dancing now. Perfect.

704
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,679
>> Boy, we could get in trouble.

705
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,159
>> Yes, we

706
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,919
>> Now that you're free, demonstrate. This

707
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,799
is Lorraine's favorite activity to teach

708
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,960
us today. This a 30day plank challenge.

709
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,600
>> That's correct. So, I think this is

710
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,200
really hard because it works your entire

711
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,559
body. You're coming down. I'm coming

712
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,679
down with you. Yep.

713
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,200
>> Go, Dr. Arms.

714
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,080
>> I'm going. All right, we're getting in

715
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,919
PL. Regular plank.

716
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,400
>> Look at you. You know it. So,

717
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,159
>> ready?

718
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,919
>> Look at that posture. That's Look at

719
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,559
that form.

720
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,840
>> Look at that tushy.

721
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,880
>> All right. Now, how do you do this? The

722
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,320
first day, this can be hard to do.

723
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,279
>> It's very hard to do. Very hard to do. I

724
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,480
agree. So the thing is is no matter

725
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,320
where you are in your life, you can do

726
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,799
this for five seconds.

727
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,520
>> Yeah.

728
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:47,520
>> Do it for 5 seconds. The next day do it

729
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,240
for 10. Do it for 20 and fight it. I

730
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,159
mean, my whole body is shaking. Okay.

731
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,039
But you know what? I'm going to I'm

you don't have to break the bank to feel

like a million bucks. Today, I'm going

768
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,200
to reveal the broke girl solution to the

769
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,120
most expensive health products. Here to

770
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,520
give us her two cents worth is the

771
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,039
author of the Frugalista Files, Natalie

772
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,559
McNeel. Now, she calls herself the

773
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,640
Frugalista, but you weren't always so

774
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,919
savvy about saving money, were you?

775
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,159
>> No. No, I wasn't. I had $20,000 worth of

776
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,320
debt. I never I always ate out. I never

777
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,880
cooked at home. I had credit card debt,

778
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,240
car loan, student loan, and I decided,

779
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,600
you know what? This can't be my life.

780
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,480
So, I decided to live a frugal and

781
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,440
fabulous life within my budget and got

782
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,200
rid of all that debt.

783
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,559
>> Good for you. And why is it women make

784
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,000
such a big mistake when it comes to

785
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,360
health purchasing? They spend so much

786
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,039
more money than they have to.

787
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,159
>> Women, we're problem solvers. There's

788
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,760
something wrong. We want to get it

789
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,440
handled. We want to look good, feel

790
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,120
good, we want to have the best in life,

791
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,720
so we'll buy a lot of products to do

792
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,559
that. It becomes almost an addiction.

793
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,159
You have a problem, you want to buy it.

794
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,919
But we can do all that stuff, but we

795
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,279
have to decide what we want and what we

796
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,559
need and do it in budget.

797
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,480
>> Right? Let's do this. Ready? Come on

798
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,000
over here. The first expensive health

799
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,720
product that we can avoid if you're a

800
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,640
frugalista is for allergy medications.

801
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,679
So, what's the broke girls solution for

802
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,240
allergies?

803
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,080
>> Allergy allergy medication is so

804
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,840
expensive. But the thing is, if you're

805
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,080
serious allergy person, I wouldn't

806
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,360
recommend this. But there's another

807
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,039
alternative you can try from buying

808
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,720
over-the-c counter allergy medicine.

809
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,039
>> And it's nettle tea.

810
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,159
>> Yes,

811
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,240
>> it really does work.

812
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,480
>> Yes, of course it works. Nettle tea

813
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,480
relieves sneezing symptoms of sneezing,

814
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,840
itching eyes, all that stuff that you

815
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,320
deal with when you have your allergies.

816
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,080
And the cool thing about it is that most

817
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,159
of us don't have serious allergies. So,

818
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,320
when you know it's allergy season coming

819
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,399
around, buy nettle tea. Don't buy an

820
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,520
expensive box of allergy medicine that's

821
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,279
going to sit on your shelf for another

822
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,120
11 months. Buy this instead.

823
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,799
>> It's an acquired taste, isn't it? I put

824
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,279
I put a little sugar in here if I could.

825
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,880
All right,

826
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,039
>> but it works. That's the main thing.

827
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,320
>> Let's compare the cost. Now, this is a

828
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,080
discount of about 80% off of what you

829
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,440
normally pay. It's a pretty big

830
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,440
difference.

831
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,520
>> So, super savings. Okay, now this is my

832
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,039
favorite one. There's a super expensive

833
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,520
mistake we make a lot. It has to do with

834
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,120
shaving gel and razors. And

835
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,480
unfortunately, most people don't know

836
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,480
about this. So, how do you cut corners?

837
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,919
What's the broke girl solution here?

838
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,399
>> Well, think about it. We're furry

839
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,480
people. People shave all the time. And

840
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,120
so, we have to be careful about that. We

841
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,840
spend 72 days out of our lifetime

842
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,640
shaving.

843
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,559
>> 72 days.

844
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,240
>> Yes. That's a lot of time and a lot of

845
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,440
money. So, you have to be careful.

846
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,440
>> So, what's the solution? What should we

847
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,960
be doing?

848
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,960
>> Dish soap is your friend.

849
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,120
>> Oo. You shave with dish soap.

850
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,440
>> Yes. Instead of using shaving cream, use

851
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,320
dish soap for shaving. You save so much

852
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,360
money.

853
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,200
>> All right, let's put this to the test.

854
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,600
We had Jennifer from our audience. She's

855
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,000
here trying her best to do this. Thank

856
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,039
you, Jennifer, for doing this. So, walk

857
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
us through. You've been doing this

858
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,480
apparently for a week.

859
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,720
>> Yes, for a week. So, you only need about

860
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,840
maybe a quarter's worth in your hand.

861
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,200
Uh, you lather it on and you could see

862
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,039
it has it definitely has a a layer on it

863
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,000
and then it's pretty easy. There's no

864
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,919
cuts. Nothing happens. It's completely

865
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,200
smooth. You could literally feel the

866
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,440
difference between the one and the

867
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,799
other. My husband loved it. He said, "My

868
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,559
legs feel just as smooth as using

869
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,799
regular shaving cream." It's really

870
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,200
cheap. You can buy any brand you want.

871
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,480
So,

872
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,039
>> you mentioned your husband. Does he mind

873
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,440
that you use his razor?

874
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,640
>> Nope.

875
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,960
>> I'm bringing it up as a personal

876
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,960
question.

877
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,480
>> No, whatever. Any razor works. Even a

878
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,000
two-blade razor is fine as well.

879
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,039
>> So, let's just take a moment here and

880
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,240
talk about this issue because there's

881
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,760
actually two schools of thought about

882
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,279
what razor you use. There's the, you

883
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,799
know, the pinkness argument, right?

884
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,039
Right. It's got to be pink is better.

885
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,640
It's worth this. It comes up, right? I

886
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,159
hear that argument a lot, but I don't

887
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,159
actually see it endorsed in my home. In

888
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,600
my home, my wife says, "Doesn't matter.

889
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,000
As long as it's a razor, it's a razor."

890
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,519
>> Absolutely.

891
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,640
>> Is that what do you think?

892
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,559
>> Absolutely.

893
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,760
>> Because this is a big issue. You think

894
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:01,760
we are wise to go pink or should we use

895
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,720
our husbands or spouses razor? Just buy

896
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,559
the male versions.

897
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,159
>> There's a thing called gender pricing.

898
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,080
And sometimes companies will market to

899
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,000
women. They'll use pastel colors and

900
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,919
they'll slap a flower on it and jack up

901
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,159
the price. And I'm not buying that at

902
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,480
all. When it comes to shaving, think

903
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,840
like a man, shave like a man. Buy men's

904
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,320
shavers. There's no other way to go

905
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,919
about it.

906
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,200
>> So, look at the savings here, folks.

907
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,120
Amazing. So, shaving gels plus the with

908
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,200
a man's razor plus the dish soap saves

909
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,720
you 37%.

910
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,960
37%.

911
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,159
>> Jeff, thank you very much. Nicely done.

912
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,159
I appreciate it. We'll be right back.

913
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,240
How do you save money on your health and

914
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,760
beauty routine?

915
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,600
>> Instead of spending money on expensive

916
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,120
conditioners, I use coconut oil. I've

917
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,960
been adding it to my hair for years, and

918
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,360
I always get compliments on it. It's my

919
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,640
little secret. Well, our secret now.

920
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,399
>> Tell us on facebook.com/d.

921
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,080
Coming up, you've seen them on the

922
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,080
internet. You've witnessed it on the

923
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,240
streets. And if you're lucky enough, you

924
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,080
could be on the receiving end. Real life

925
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,159
acts of kindness, powerful and

926
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,240
unexpected random deeds that will

927
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,080
restore your faith in humanity. Coming

928
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,280
up next,

929
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,839
a daytime television event. Emmy

930
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,359
award-winning Dr. Oz celebrates his

931
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,839
1,000th show with Hugh Jackman.

932
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,960
Thursday, May 7th.

933
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:25,520
That's coming up next week.

934
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,879
[Applause]

935
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,359
All right, question for the audience.

936
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,879
Listen carefully. How many of you would

937
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,359
have a friend that who would help you

938
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,280
out no matter what? Someone who makes

939
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,200
you say, "I wish I could be that good."

940
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,040
Put your hands up. Someone you really,

941
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,359
really, really, really admire. So that's

942
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,679
my friend here, Dan Leeski. He is so

943
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,359
kind, he named his company after it. In

944
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,320
fact, when you eat a kind bar, that's

945
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,679
actually him. Welcome to the show, Dan.

946
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,320
All right. Now, he's in the book called

947
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,520
Do the Kind Thing. But just to be clear,

948
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,200
uh, and I love people to get this

949
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,720
message. It's kindness is not just a

950
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,480
company name or a book name. It's

951
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,760
actually your mission in life. Why is

952
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,839
that?

953
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,400
>> Um well, I was reflecting a little bit

954
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,400
about what I wanted to contribute to

955
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,240
society. I thought a little bit about my

956
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,119
upbringing and my father. He was a

957
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,000
Holocaust survivor. And from an early

958
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,920
age, I heard about stories not just of

959
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,560
the horror of what he went through in a

960
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,440
concentration camp, but also of how he

961
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,359
survived through the selflessness of

962
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,839
others that took risks to to help him.

963
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,920
It kind of really marked me and my

964
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,760
siblings throughout our lives to feel

965
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,520
that we need to build bridges and to try

966
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,720
to help u make those connections with

967
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,160
people. So, one of the reason I want to

968
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,839
do this segment today is that research

969
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,040
continues to show that tiny acts of

970
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,240
kindness, small little things you

971
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,640
wouldn't think were that important, have

972
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,480
a much larger impact because people get

973
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,079
motivated to pay it forward. So, today

974
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,400
we're going to celebrate real life acts

975
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,160
of kindness. And the first video comes

976
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,800
from a story that made headlines all

977
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,800
around the world.

978
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Images of the devastating blast that

979
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,359
leveled three buildings in New York's

980
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,079
East Village shocked the country and the

981
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,079
world. In the terrifying moments before

982
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,560
those buildings collapsed in a fiery

983
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,680
inferno, a woman began screaming,

984
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,680
trapped on her fire escape.

985
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,359
>> As smoke began billowing ominously, a

986
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,520
brave stranger emerged from the crowd

987
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,000
gathering below.

988
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,160
Oblivious to his own safety, he climbed

989
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,280
the ladder, grabbed the woman's hand,

990
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,280
and led her down to safety.

991
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Isn't that kind? So, what struck you

992
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,720
about this real life act of kindness?

993
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,560
>> I mean, what what what really is

994
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,000
beautiful is the selflessness of the

995
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,160
person that didn't know the stranger,

996
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,400
risked his life, and the more we go out

997
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,640
of our way to take that risk, the more

998
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,160
that we actually find meaning.

999
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,760
>> You know, you can also extend your life

1000
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,440
expectancy, by the way, if you're kind

1001
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,119
to others. We do this on the real age

1002
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,800
survey, and it ends up giving you about

1003
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,880
three and a half years of extra life if

1004
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,640
you're living optimistically and kind

1005
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,480
towards others. So, I saw this next act

1006
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,000
of kindness on Instagram, and the

1007
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,920
pictures, well, they speak for

1008
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
themselves. These are Instagram pictures

1009
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,760
from hair stylist Mark Butos. Every

1010
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,760
Sunday, Mark takes to the streets of New

1011
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,200
York to provide free haircuts to the

1012
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,079
homeless, and he's joining us in studio

1013
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,359
now. How are you?

1014
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,720
>> I'm doing well. How are you?

1015
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,760
>> You have very nice hair, by the way.

1016
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,440
>> Thank you. Thank you.

1017
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,440
>> So, what inspired you to go out and do

1018
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,880
this? Um, you know, a couple years ago,

1019
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,800
I traveled to the Philippines to visit

1020
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,920
family with my girlfriend and um, her

1021
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,359
father, who passed away a couple years

1022
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,720
ago, used to get his haircut at a little

1023
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,320
barber shop in town and um, I knew I

1024
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,839
wanted to do something and and I rented

1025
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,359
a chair in the in the barber shop and I

1026
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,280
had less fortunate children come in all

1027
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,720
day and I figured I need to bring this

1028
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,000
back home to New York and no matter

1029
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,920
where I go, it's not that hard to bring

1030
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
my scissors everywhere I go with me.

1031
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,760
Well, well, sometimes, as you all know,

1032
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,359
a haircut's not just a haircut. It can

1033
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,320
really boost your self-esteem. So, I

1034
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,160
have a couple pictures that really

1035
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,359
caught me. This is a client of yours

1036
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,480
before. Now look at after.

1037
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,560
Is that cool? Very dashing afterwards.

1038
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,640
I love what you do. Millions of people

1039
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,640
viewed this next kind act after it was

1040
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,640
caught on camera unbeknownst to everyone

1041
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,380
involved at this checkout line in Sou

1042
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,000
Falls, South Dakota.

1043
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,160
[Music]

1044
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,400
A young mother shopping for diapers at

1045
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,720
her local supertore was told by the

1046
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,440
cashier that she could only get one box

1047
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,760
at the discount price. Overhearing this,

1048
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,520
a complete stranger stepped in. This

1049
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,839
good Samaritan, the one wearing blue

1050
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,920
pants, immediately opened her purse and

1051
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,480
offered to pay for the young mother's

1052
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,880
extra diapers. All the woman asked for

1053
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,680
in return was that she paid forward to

1054
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,160
someone else one day. The heartwarming

1055
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,160
random act of kindness left a mother in

1056
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,000
tears.

1057
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,760
>> D, why is it important for us to reach

1058
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,200
out and help people we know nothing

1059
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,720
about? I mean in this day and age m the

1060
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,520
challenges that we're going to face as a

1061
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:54,720
society to climate changeobia

1062
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,280
nuclear threats cl you know the problems

1063
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,560
with resource scarcity water scarcity

1064
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,800
we're only going to be able to tackle

1065
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,200
them if we recognize our shared humanity

1066
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,119
and connecting with one another helps us

1067
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,280
shatter cultural stereotypes helps us

1068
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,599
discover each other's humanity and it's

1069
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,400
just really also very fulfilling gives

1070
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,119
us so much more meaning it gives us a a

1071
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,880
better enjoyment out of life. Now I know

1072
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,480
why I love Daniel. Thank you very much.

1073
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,079
His new book, Do the Kind Thing, is out

1079
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,240
>> Do you have a health question for Dr.

1080
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,240
Oz?

1081
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,240
>> What is the best way to de-stress? I

1082
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,680
have a stressful job. Many times when

1083
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,560
I'm trying to sleep, I can't stop

1084
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,160
thinking about work. Go to dr.com for

1085
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,560
the answer and ask your own question

1086
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,560
with #question.

1087
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
Road rage,

1088
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,040
>> come on,

1089
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,200
>> is on the rise.

1090
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,520
>> Aggressive drivers, myself included, are

1091
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,000
everywhere. How it may wreck your

1092
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,920
health. My heart rate jumped from 50

1093
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,920
beats to 88 beats a minute.

1094
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,960
>> And how to pump the brakes on a

1095
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,440
potential blow up. Plus, country music

1096
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,839
star Tim McGrath and his new mission to

1097
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,280
help save lives. 30 million Americans

1098
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:12,550
are living with diabetes.

1099
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:16,800
>> All new Oz. That's coming up tomorrow.

1100
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:18,240
[Music]

1101
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,240
And we've all been there. After a

1102
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,240
workout or a smoldering day out in the

1103
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,240
summer sun, the sweaty stench sets in.

1104
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,079
We can be strong. But now, brand new

1105
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,440
research has a solution to our

1106
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,800
embarrassing odors. Now, get this.

1107
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,280
They're working on a breakthrough

1108
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,200
perfume that makes you smell better the

1109
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,880
more you sweat. Not only does it contain

1110
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,040
an ingredient that activates as you

1111
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,359
sweat, can also remove the bad odors,

1112
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,280
not just cover them up. So, sweat it out

1113
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,960
because new science has apparently got

1114
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,000
you covered. Congratulations to all the

1115
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,240
scientists doing this. Now, it's time

1116
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,480
for in case you missed it. First, the

1117
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,160
broke girl solutions for expensive

1118
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,839
health products. There's one genius

1119
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,760
hack. I love this one. I want you from

1120
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,599
now on to try this soap instead of

1121
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,040
shaving cream on your legs. Believe it

1122
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,560
or not, it works just as well as that

1123
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,720
fancy shaving cream you've been using.

1124
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,280
And you know what? Stop buying your own

1125
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,480
women's pink razors. Buy men's razors.

1126
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,240
Men's razors less expensive. Why bother

1127
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,760
paying more for pretty packaging? It

1128
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,599
works just the same. Men need to shave

1129
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,720
carefully and closely as well. It'll

1130
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,400
work for you. Take advantage of these

1131
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,079
hacks. You save over 30% of the money

1132
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,520
you would have spent otherwise. Next, a

1133
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,520
shout out to my friend Dr. David

1134
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,920
Promoter. new book comes out today. It's

1135
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,839
called Brain Maker: The Power of Gut

1136
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,839
Microbes to Heal and Protect Your Brain

1137
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,760
for Life. And I'm excited Dr. Promutter

1138
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,440
will be a guest on the show soon to tell

1139
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,040
us how we can change our mood through

1140
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,119
our gut. You don't want to miss it. And

1141
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,520
lastly, and this is really important, I

1142
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,040
want to start an army for change in

1143
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,800
fighting the fat shaming that's going

1144
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,040
on. The internet makes it easier for

1145
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,800
shamers to hide, but we are going to

1146
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,240
change our words so we can change the

1147
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,720
conversation. Take a look at this

1148
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,480
powerful new PSA that we debuted on the

1149
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,480
show today.

1150
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,280
>> Words matter.

1151
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,359
Don't call me fat.

1152
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,040
>> Don't call me skinny.

1153
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,880
>> Call us strong.

1154
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,359
>> Don't judge me by what I look like on

1155
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,880
the outside because I'm all about being

1156
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,640
healthy on the inside.

1157
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,160
>> I don't go to the gym to look good for

1158
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,000
other people. I do it for myself.

1159
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,359
>> Think before you call someone fat

1160
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,920
because weight shaming doesn't make

1161
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,920
anyone thinner. It just makes you small.

1162
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,319
Start using body positive language about

1163
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,200
yourself and others. Join the movement

1164
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,650
and

1165
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:32,240
>> be body positive.

Share it and be body positive. I'll see
