Microwave breakfasts, omelette cups,

burritos, and egg muffins. Fast, easy.

When it comes to frozen food, breakfast

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,120
foods are queen. But are they really

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,080
good for you? Are they just junk food in

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,520
disguise? Plus, fat shamers. I can't

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,160
take care of it because it's both so

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,320
fake. Caught on tape. She's eating too

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,680
much chocolate. Why are you insulting me

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,680
about my weight? Coming up next.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,640

Today, an investigation into a giant

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,879
shift happening in your frozen food

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,600
aisle. The food industry is offering an

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,920
unprecedented number of microwavable

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,080
frozen breakfast food options, including

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,680
your favorites. Breakfast sandwiches,

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,479
delicious looking omelette cups,

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,040
burritos, and egg muffins, all hot and

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,600
ready in minutes. Many even claim to be

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,000
healthier. But are they? Or they just

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,479
junk food in disguise? Investigator and

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,880
mom of two, Marciao put many of these

28
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,920
options to the test in the best food lab

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,920
there is, her own busy kitchen.

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,600
Okay, so I'm shopping for breakfast

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
sandwiches. I can't remember the last

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,640
time I bought a breakfast sandwich, so

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,240
this should be interesting. Hey,

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,240
Quesadilla.

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,920
Do you want to try these for breakfast?

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,079
Um,

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,560
what are they? It's a breakfast sandwich

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,960
made on a waffle. It's bacon, egg, and

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,640
cheese. I don't really like eggs or

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,280
cheese, but I could try it with

41
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,880
something else. Maybe just bacon. So,

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
this is what I ended up getting. We have

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,680
two different English muffins. They are

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,479
different. This one is like on a waffle

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,759
and this is a breadless egg cup which I

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,000
am very excited about.

47
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,160
Marian, was that the best assignment you

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
have ever been given? You know, any

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
assignment that involves tasting food.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm in. Sign me up for it. And your

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,959
daughter's already an investigative

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
reporter. She's very discerning. Yeah.

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
You know, breakfast is a really hard

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,840
meal for me. I was really happy to get

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,160
this assignment because this is tough

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,599
for me. I'm a low carb eater, so I'm

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,520
always looking for portable low carb

58
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,520
options. And with my kids, I'm looking

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,840
for alternatives to the staples that are

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
high sugar, high carb, like cereal and

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,519
pancakes. So, this could change things

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,959
in my house. And how big have these

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,959
products become now, these microwavable

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,239
breakfasts? When it comes to frozen

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,720
food, breakfast foods are doing so well.

66
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,599
Really, it's for two reasons. One is

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,760
millennials. So, 82% of millennials say

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,280
that this is a good option for their

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,680
kids. And case in point, I agree with

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,400
that completely. The other one is the

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,239
keto crowd. Keto is huge right now.

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,280
They're looking for low carb options.

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,640
Those two things are driving this

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,480
industry. Yeah, that they use the the

75
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,840
bun is actually egg and it looks so

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,000
delicious. It does look good. All right,

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,680
let's start. So, we asked food scientist

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
Taylor and he's a fanatic, by the way,

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,560
about breakfast food. Taylor Wallace

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,640
will be here to break down exactly how

81
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
microwavable breakfast made. Let's start

82
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,560
with the prime ingredient of all, the

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,319
egg. Is there a real egg in these

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,280
microwavable breakfasts? Crack the egg

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,760
for me. So actually, yes, many of these

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,400
products, the main ingredient is a whole

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,000
egg. Now, also in these products, you're

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,640
going to see some of your other normal

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,799
culprits, different food additives. Now,

90
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,720
they might look scary, but they're all

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,040
in there for a functional purpose,

92
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,080
right? So, for instance, it looks scary.

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,319
Zanthan gum, that's just a dietary fiber

94
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,760
that we add to food. We add it to eggs

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,440
because we don't want the egg to crumble

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,400
when you bite into it and fall into your

97
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,159
lap. modified cornstarch that just

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
provides a little bit of texture to the

99
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,680
product. And then you have all these

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,760
different flavors. And you might ask,

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,920
well, why not just add butter? Because

102
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,400
butter oxidizes and makes the product go

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,159
stale. So instead, we add these flavors

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
that won't oxidize and produce a bad

105
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,519
taste. But you just express the bias. I

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,640
love that it's a real egg. I sort of

107
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
wish I didn't have to add all these

108
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
things in there, but I know you guys

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,040
have other technologies. For example,

110
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,680
you have a way of making the the frozen

111
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,680
microwavable breakfast flavorful and

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,120
locking in that flavor. And it has to do

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,400
with this. And you're a flavor

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,479
scientist. So what does this have to do

115
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
with flavor? Well, so there's two main

116
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,960
things that you have to worry about in

117
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,960
products like egg sandwiches. One is

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,560
water because we know water makes things

119
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,360
go bad. And two is oxygen because oxygen

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,600
oxidizes things. So what do we do? We

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,800
freeze the water because frozen water

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,199
can't do much. And then we add nitrogen

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
to the bag or to the package. So very

124
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,639
similar to what you see in potato chips.

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
If you buy a bag of potato chips with

126
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,360
all the air inside, that's nitrogen.

127
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,960
When you open the bag, then the oxygen

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,639
comes in, you leave it out for a day and

129
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,240
it goes stale. The same thing happens

130
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,160
with egg sandwiches. All right, so let's

131
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,520
take a look at different types of frozen

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,800
breakfastes that we find at the grocery

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,320
store. I took that list that you just

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
got, Mara, that whole that treasure

135
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,880
trove and I split it out and I know that

136
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,479
there's a big keto move. So explain how

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,639
people have hacked that system. Yeah. So

138
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,440
just as a reminder, it's very very

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,120
highfat, very low carb. So when you take

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,039
a look at these traditional breakfast

141
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,120
sandwiches here, these are not going to

142
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,039
be an option for keto followers because

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,440
of the bread. But when you look over

144
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,080
here, this is really a game changer if

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,280
you're a keto devote. They have made the

146
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,000
bread out of eggs. So this is breadless.

147
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,240
It's essentially I saw that. I wasn't

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,160
sure if that was real. It's real. It's

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,080
eggs. It is high protein. It is

150
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
extremely low carb egg bun. Yeah. So

151
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,000
this is the industry responding to that

152
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,440
demand. They have heard loud and clear

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,960
what low carb dieters want. All right,

154
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
so seven grams of carbs. How do the rest

155
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,800
of your options? So you can see it's a

156
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,800
big difference. So the English muffin

157
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,840
option, 28 grams of carbs. So I've never

158
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
been good at math, but I think that's

159
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,840
four times the amount, right? Better

160
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,160
than you say. Exactly four times. And

161
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,759
here we have the croissant, 27 gram.

162
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,199
Pretty much the same. The biscuit, which

163
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,400
to me looks like the most dectable,

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,000
delicious one. I think that's a pretty

165
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,600
good deal. Oh my goodness. I'm working

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,680
hard not to This was intriguing to me.

167
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Flatbread's a good idea. Flatbread is a

168
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,440
great idea. You see that it is the

169
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
lowest carb of all of them, but still

170
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,919
much higher than the breadless one. And

171
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,199
you tasted these and you had that

172
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
discerning daughter of you taste as

173
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,440
well. How did this breadless version do?

174
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,600
It was absolutely delicious. I did not

175
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,759
miss the bread at all. But I did have to

176
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
wonder, is that too much protein? Am I

177
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,039
overdoing it? Now I looked into it. I

178
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,039
think the protein's okay. The bigger

179
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,479
concern for me is salt. Okay. Sometimes

180
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,919
in order to make it flavorful because

181
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,360
you freeze things doesn't taste the same

182
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,720
always. They could have more salt than

183
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,319
you want. So just take a look at that.

184
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
But I'm overall I was impressed that you

185
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,280
had this many options. But I want to go

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,720
talk to our audience member here because

187
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,120
the next microwavable frozen breakfast

188
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,199
investigation had to do with the the

189
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,360
crustless kiches.

190
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,639
There's no carbs in a crustless kiche.

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,800
Do I have this right? Yes. Well, I want

192
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,000
to do me compare these two and see if

193
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,600
you taste the difference. Mar, you can

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
go do it as well. Here's Oh, thank you.

195
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I thought you'd never ask. Exactly. I

196
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
feel you ate them all at home before you

197
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,960
got here. Now, I'm going to reveal

198
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,960
something to you in a second, but these

199
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,160
are not quite made the same way. So,

200
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,000
which do you like more, least? This

201
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,039
one's much better. Much better. Mhm. All

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,240
right. So, I'm just going to reveal

203
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,880
something to you. One of these is

204
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,880
actually homemade by yours truly, and

205
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,479
the other one was made in the store.

206
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,280
This

207
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,520
was made by us. Nice job, Dr. Oz. Oh,

208
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,240
wow. This is the storebought one. I only

209
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,800
point it out because this didn't take a

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,400
ton of time. I think most people prefer

211
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,160
it, but I get why you don't do it,

212
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
right? It's a lack of time. Did this

213
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,560
taste good enough that if you didn't

214
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,319
have time to make it on your own, you'd

215
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
still be okay with it? Yeah, I'd be okay

216
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,160
with it. All right. So, it works. Yeah,

217
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,360
it's a great option. You pick and choose

218
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
what you want. I don't think it's quite

219
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,560
the same as making it yourself, but it's

220
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,840
probably good enough for most of the

221
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,919
especially the busy moms out there. Yes.

222
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,000
How do they compare nutritionally? So,

223
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,479
it's actually there's a lot of good news

224
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,280
here. These have the the store-bought

225
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,880
ones are real egg or egg based, which is

226
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,479
just basically liquid egg. Now, they do

227
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,919
have other things added in because they

228
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,919
do have to live on a shelf. They do have

229
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,840
to be frozen, but for the most part, it

230
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,039
is very close to the real thing. You can

231
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,360
feel good about eating them and giving

232
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,960
them to your kids. off at home, Lisa.

233
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,400
All right, let me one last topic here.

234
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,319
We investigated frozen microwave

235
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,080
breakfast burritos. Taylor has these

236
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,280
guys gotten a lot of criticism over the

237
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,440
years, but they seem to be making a

238
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,759
comeback, right? You know, when I was a

239
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,759
kid, it was like these things are

240
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,319
terrible, right? I mean, they're mushy

241
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,479
and gooey and not great. Food scientists

242
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,879
have this down to an art. And now, just

243
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,120
like over there, they taste fantastic.

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,440
And not only that, there's vegetarian

245
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,960
options, there's farm-to-table options.

246
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,000
We've got something for everybody. All

247
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,280
right. So, you still want to watch the

248
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,959
sodium on these, especially if you got

249
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,719
pressure issues. We always say make

250
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,080
bacon a special food. So, you don't want

251
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,599
to have that every day either. Maybe

252
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,959
twice a week kind of thing. When we come

253
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,800
back, we show you a brand new

254
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,200
microwavable breakfast that allows you

255
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,120
to use your own fresh egg. Is it the

256
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,710
best of both worlds? We'll find out when

257
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,000
we come back.

258
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:53,680
[Music]

259
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,800
[Applause]

260
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,800
[Music]

261
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,560
If you have ever tried to make an omelet

262
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,640
and this happened, right, you're not

263
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,160
alone. Guess what? Restaurants, the best

264
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,480
ones in the world, use making omelette

265
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,160
as the ultimate test of a chef's true

266
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,680
skill. So, I didn't pass this time, but

267
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm I'm getting better. I can cover it

268
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,320
up. I can stitch this back together

269
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,160
again. I've got the technology. Anyway,

270
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
today we're investigating a brand new

271
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,839
shortcut. Turning omelettes into a

272
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,240
weekday quickie meal using your own

273
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,240
microwave. These are called omelets in a

274
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
cup. Now, food scientist Taylor Walls is

275
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,440
here to help us figure out what's really

276
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,120
in these. There's two main kinds of

277
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
almonds in the cup. Break them up for

278
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,880
us. Okay, so your first kind, go ahead

279
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,600
and open the package. And what you'll

280
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,279
see, it's got everything inside, right?

281
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,760
So, you've got your little vegetables

282
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,839
and meat. Uh, and then you have a liquid

283
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,399
egg. So, go on and and check it out. And

284
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,240
a liquid egg is basically the same thing

285
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,480
that you buy in the grocery store in

286
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,399
those milk carton like jugs. It's just

287
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
been pasteurized a little bit more than

288
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,600
the whole egg to prevent bacteria from

289
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
growing. Pour it in here. Yep. So, pour

290
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
it right in. You can pop it in the

291
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
microwave and you're ready to go.

292
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,640
Basically, put my fixings in there. I'm

293
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,080
good to go. Absolutely. It's so easy, so

294
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,160
simple. Absolutely. So, how's yours

295
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,560
different? So, the second one, this is

296
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,880
for consumers that prefer their products

297
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,240
a little less processed. So, we charge

298
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,640
them the same price, but don't add the

299
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,000
egg. You have to add your own. You're

300
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,240
kidding me. It's the same price, right?

301
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
And it's a instead of the egg, it's you

302
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,200
have to add your own. And it's not a

303
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,519
liquid egg. So if you see, you've got

304
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,360
the cheese, the vegetables, the meat in

305
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,760
there. Same thing as in your other

306
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,600
product. You break the egg. Yep. Oh,

307
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,839
heard to break it on plastic. Oh my

308
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,720
goodness. Here. Break it over here. Then

309
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,480
put it in the pan. There.

310
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,320
All right. That's it. And then you add

311
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
the substies in there. Then you add the

312
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,720
stuff. Mix it up. And there you go. I

313
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,079
got to say, I'm impressed. This is

314
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
actually so close to what I would

315
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,399
normally want to do. I probably would

316
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,399
think about this. Right. Right. And like

317
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,920
Mara said, they're very close to the

318
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,760
normal food product that you would cook

319
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,160
in your kitchen. Got a little bit of

320
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,480
additives in there to help prevent mold

321
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,399
growth or bacteria growth. Uh but

322
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,839
overall, it's the same thing. Food

323
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,120
scientist is happy. I'm happy. All

324
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
right. And the price you mention is the

325
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
same. Yeah, the price I mentioned is

326
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,959
about $3 a pack. So great for someone

327
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,040
like a college student or somebody like

328
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,320
you and I that are on the go. Might not

329
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,920
want to feed the whole family with it

330
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
because that gets kind of expensive, but

331
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
great on the go. I got to say as I look

332
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,880
at these I I wish I didn't have the

333
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,160
preservatives. It's not that complicated

334
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,000
to cut this up. I would think I just put

335
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,720
it in the fridge and add it myself.

336
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,720
Well, remember the number one goal of a

337
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
food scientist is to make sure your food

338
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
products are safe. So, you have to add

339
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,279
those in there because you want them to

340
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,959
be shelf stable so they don't grow

341
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,079
bacteria on there so you don't get sick.

342
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,519
Fair enough. Those who know what you're

343
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,399
getting. All right. Thanks, Taylor. So,

344
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,800
for those of you who want to make

345
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,519
breakfast in the microwave,

346
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,200
an idea, Mara's got a DIY solution that

347
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,800
has become incredibly popular. It's all

348
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,959
over the web. Yeah, share it with us.

349
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,880
This is a great food prep hack. You can

350
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,040
get a fresh omelette in the morning in

351
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,480
seconds. So, a good idea is to start the

352
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,760
night before, right? You take a mason

353
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,440
jar. You just finished eating dinner.

354
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,120
You're putting away leftovers. Just take

355
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
a spoonful of each of these leftovers.

356
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,000
And while I'm doing that, can you please

357
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,839
be my sue chef? Can you crack those eggs

358
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,079
for me? Put them here. Here uh in that

359
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,680
bowl. So, you put your leftovers. You

360
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,839
got some veggies. Maybe you have some

361
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,200
meat from dinner. You put it all here in

362
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,440
this mason jar. And of course, I would

363
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,120
be much neater if I were actually doing

364
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,959
it in my house. And then you take this

365
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
and you just stick it in your fridge.

366
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,079
You put this in the fridge. You put it

367
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,079
in there overnight. In the morning, you

368
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,320
wake up. You do what you just did. You

369
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,920
crack a few eggs and you pour them into

370
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,040
the mason jar. That's it. That's it. So,

371
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,120
you're getting an omelette in a cup. You

372
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,279
stir this up. You put it in your

373
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,959
microwave. Put a You put the paper towel

374
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,320
on it. You put the rubber band over the

375
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,240
top. Oh, I like this idea. You put this

376
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,839
in the microwave. And we have a little

377
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,079
switcheroo here. It's actually hot cuz

378
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,639
we did just cook it. Okay. And then you

379
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,320
have Smells good. An omelette in a cup.

380
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,240
You microwave it 45se secondond

381
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
intervals. You stir. You put it back in

382
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,920
for 45 seconds until it's done. Put it

383
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,839
down. Let's test this. And then you can

384
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,680
run out the door with this. You can eat

385
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,920
it on your commute and you have an

386
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,519
omelette to go. See this? This I like.

387
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,040
There's no preservatives, no products. I

388
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,880
bet this doesn't cost much either. And

389
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,959
no, I mean it's fresh. It's leftovers in

390
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,560
the end. Easy. It's leftovers. You do

391
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,000
most of the work the night before. It's

392
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,440
delicious. I toast you, Mara. Thank you

393
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,959
very This is how a mom makes breakfast.

394
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,550
Thank you very much. We'll be right

395
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,730
back.

397
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,680
Up next, we investigate. Can you get

398
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,040
addicted to microwave meals? What you

399
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,840
need to know about what your favorite

400
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:31,149
frozen foods can be doing to your brain.

401

[Music]

402
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,399
I know. Did you start to salivate at

403
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,079
that sound? Right? You start to think

404
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,240
about food and that beep starts with

405
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,240
your microwave. Millions of you rely on

406
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,920
quick microwave meals because it's a

407
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,160
quick lunch or ready in minutes hot

408
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,279
dinner. But can you get addicted to

409
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,880
these fast food frozen foods? How does

410
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,440
your freezer look? Does it look like

411
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,720
this? Someone in our audience is the

412
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,399
owner of this stocked freezer full of

413
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,240
those microwave meals and is being

414
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,480
turned in for their obsession with

415
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,079
microwave meals. Please welcome Angela,

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,079
who's turning in her best friend, Su

417
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,079
Ella.

418
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,000
You didn't know this was happening, did

419
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,279
you? No. No. I'm I I think I'm fine. You

420
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,199
think you're fine? What What is the

421
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,720
issue here? She has a problem. She has a

422
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,880
very big problem. And that's a real

423
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
photo of her freezer. Yes. And how often

424
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,000
is she eating microwave frozen food? All

425
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,720
the time. Breakfast, lunch, snack. I'm

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,320
busy. No, it's not. I really love it.

427
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,399
No. But what do you love about it so

428
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,600
much? Well, it's they have healthy ones.

429
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,440
I eat lean queen scene. I I like um hot

430
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,880
pockets sometimes when I'm really in a

431
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,079
rush. So, you know, it's easy. It's

432
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,560
convenient. What do you think about your

433
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,120
friend's concern over your perceived

434
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,120
addiction towards microwave fast food? I

435
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,959
don't know what her concern is. You

436
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,440
don't know my concern? No. You send me

437
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,000
coupons. You want to You want to buy

438
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,839
things off eBay. It's it's microwavable

439
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,240
food. No, you go to the dollar store.

440
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,480
You go to all of the stores. No, no, no.

441
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,680
It's too much. Too much. Let's just talk

442
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
about Come on up here a little bit.

443
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,279
Well, we got a little discussion. I

444
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,240
understand. No, I know. I understand the

445
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,839
allure of frozen meals, but in reality,

446
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,279
there's something that's really

447
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,199
addictive in these foods that makes them

448
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,959
so desirous for us. But they taste good.

449
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,560
So, Mark Shasker, food journalist

450
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,000
extraordinaire and a real expert in the

451
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,120
area. He's made a taste test for us that

452
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,560
you and I are going to be participants

453
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,079
in. You got to tell the truth, though.

454
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,120
All, right, so take us. What are we

455
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,480
going to taste and what what kind of an

456
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,000
organization do you have here? Okay. We

457
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,680
got three lasagnas. The first one is

458
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,839
fresh lasagna. We made this. This is

459
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,000
like what you'd make at home. This is

460
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,639
also lasagna we made, but not fresh. We

461
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,440
froze it and then we reheated it.

462
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,440
That That fresh is good. Keep going. I'm

463
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,120
moving along here. And then we got This

464
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,720
is the microwavable lasagna like you'd

465
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,760
buy at the supermarket. Let's look at

466
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,320
the microwave here. There'll be

467
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,320
something interesting here.

468
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,120
That is good. That is really good. Tell

469
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,759
tell me what you like about it. You

470
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,279
should have this. You like it. Yeah, it

471
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,959
tastes real good. Okay. So, there's

472
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
something really interesting. This is

473
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,000
This is actually better than the fresh.

474
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,759
Better than fresh. Something really

475
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,240
interesting happening here. So, this is

476
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,800
another tale of taste bud trickery. This

477
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,839
is where it's it's in the flavor. It's

478
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,240
in how they created this experience of

479
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,120
lasagna in a frozen food where we're

480
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,199
going to find something interesting.

481
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,880
Let's uncover the anatomy of a microwave

482
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,480
meal. How do they actually pull that

483
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,399
off? Cuz I do think like you, it

484
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,920
definitely tastes better than the frozen

485
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,040
stuff that you made yourself, right?

486
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,800
What did they do differently? So the

487
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,240
first issue is preservatives. Mark, what

488
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,519
kind are we talking about? Okay, so

489
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,440
yeah, one thing they do to get that

490
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,480
flavor, they use synthetic flavorings.

491
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,920
We've talked about that before, but

492
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,160
that's how they they jack up that

493
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,800
flavor. We also see a lot of the same

494
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,959
guilty suspects that we see in other

495
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
processed foods. There's polyorbate 80.

496
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,959
That's a bulking agent that makes the

497
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,560
sauce taste nice and smooth. There's

498
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,560
something called potassium bromate.

499
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,240
That's a dough additive. It's actually

500
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,600
illegal in some countries. And then we

501
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,120
have sodium nitrate. Now, we've talked

502
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,800
about that. It's illegal in some

503
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,440
countries. It's illegal and it's in it's

504
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,120
in our frozen foods. Oh. Oh. All right.

505
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
So, these are theoretical concerns, but

506
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,519
but the next issue is a real concern,

507
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,640
which is sugar. How much sugar?

508
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,160
Actually, why would you even add sugar

509
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,240
to lasagna? There's already pasta in

510
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,839
there. Well, because as we saw, that

511
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,600
flavor takes a beating. So, what's an

512
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,120
easy way to jack that flavor back up?

513
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,880
Just dump in some sugar. And you're

514
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,640
going to be shocked at how much. We

515
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,360
found one frozen entree that had 29 g of

516
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,360
sugar in a serving. Did you hear that?

517
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,839
Okay, it gets worse cuz guess how big

518
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,839
the serving is? This big. It's only

519
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,880
half. Most people think they pull it out

520
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,240
of their microwave and they think I get

521
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,200
to eat the whole thing. Well, then

522
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,120
you're getting 58 g of sugar. That's the

523
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,440
sugar that's in two candy bars. So, who

524
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,120
would ever think I'm nuking my dinner,

525
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,120
there's two candy bars worth of sugar in

526
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,799
there. It's crazy. So, a lot of sugar.

527
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,919
And then there's another hidden source

528
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,360
of carbs, modified starch, which I don't

529
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,200
even know what do you modified starch to

530
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,640
do? Yeah, modified starch. What is it?

531
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,919
Well, it's there to get rid of some of

532
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,600
the problems that you get when you

533
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,360
reheat frozen food. You don't get those

534
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,880
puddles of water so that it holds its

535
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,799
shape. Uh, but it's essentially

536
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,480
carbohydrates that have no flavor. So,

537
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,080
you're getting carbs in your tummy that

538
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,280
you don't taste on the way down. And I

539
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
think that's where the worry is. So,

540
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,760
stay with Mark for a second. I'm going

541
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,679
explain to everybody what happens to

542
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,440
your brain while you're having all these

543
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,120
empty carbs that are hidden from you.

544
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,039
So, you got the brain here, you got you

545
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,640
there, right? Take a bite out of one of

546
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,400
these meals, right? And what ends up

547
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,919
happening is you begin to to fall in

548
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,440
love with it, right? Begin to crave it.

549
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
Then what happens? Your blood sugar

550
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,600
starts to spike up. When the blood sugar

551
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,960
goes up, dopamine is released from your

552
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,559
brain, which makes you really happy,

553
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,120
smiley, right? We all know that, right?

554
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,440
Like comfort food. But then over time,

555
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,320
your blood sugar falls back down again

556
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
and you crave that high you just had. So

557
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,760
your blood low blood sugar levels cause

558
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,440
an increased appetite, right? You eat

559
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,120
more food because the time seems like

560
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,120
it's the right to do. And the next thing

561
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,480
you know, you eat more of those frozen

562
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,120
meals that you've been craving and

563
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,720
feeling okay about doing it. So Mark,

564
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,480
you say in addition to this, which is

565
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
sort of a chemical addiction, there's a

566
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,120
psychological addiction these microwave

567
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,400
meals can can cause. Yeah. So we've seen

568
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,679
this interaction before. You got things

569
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,200
like foods with a lot of sugar and

570
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,799
flavoring, makes it compulsive, makes it

571
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,480
really delicious in the moment, hard to

572
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,480
stop eating. So I think there's a lot of

573
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,000
ways these these get us eating too much.

574
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,120
So don't be a killjoy here. If we're

575
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,760
going to eat our microwaves, cuz I think

576
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Suela, who's nervously laughing now, is

577
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,880
probably going to still eat some of the

578
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,960
microwaves that are in her freezer. Give

579
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,559
us some tactics, some hacks. Okay. So,

580
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,559
one thing is to look at the ingredient

581
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,320
list because they're not all the same.

582
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,679
The the ingredients that come at the

583
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,039
beginning of the list, there's more of

584
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,960
them. So, look for the good things. If

585
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,320
it's a broccoli pasta, look for broccoli

586
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
at the beginning of the ingredient list.

587
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,720
If it's at the very end, there means

588
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,320
there's not much. And if there's if you

589
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,240
don't see it at all, be worried about

590
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,280
that. So, Sella, I need your verdict

591
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,840
here. Your friend, me, doc professor

592
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,200
Shasker next to us seems to think you're

593
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,400
probably better served to eat your

594
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,000
microwave meals a little differently.

595
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,080
What do you think? I don't think I'll do

596
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
it every day now. I think I do it like

597
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,440
maybe maybe twice maybe three times a

598
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,679
week slowly process on my addiction on

599
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,919
it. But um thank you for having an

600
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,440
impact. Nicely done. Thank you for

601
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,440
saying that. We'll be right back. Thank

602
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,440
you.

603
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,200
Shocking updates on the house of

604
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,120
horrors. Why the parents tortured their

605
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,640
own children. Louise Turpin's sister

606
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,880
reveals their intimate prison

607
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,280
conversations. any expression of remorse

608
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,919
and Oz true crime investigation. That's

609
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,760
coming up on Wednesday.

610
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,919
We're back with our investigation in the

611
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,080
public fat shaming. Would you know what

612
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,760
to do if it happened to you? What about

613
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,080
if the if it came from the one person

614
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,919
you trust the most, your own doctor?

615
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,640
According to one study, about half of

616
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,320
women half say they've been shamed by a

617
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,480
physician with weight being one of the

618
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,880
top reasons. Latoya says she was fat

619
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,440
shamed by her doctor who ignored her

620
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,520
pain symptoms. And after feeling ill,

621
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Rebecca says her doctor told her to lose

622
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,919
weight, but turns out her health issues

623
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,480
were not a result of her size. It was

624
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,919
actually cancer. So, Rebecca, let's talk

625
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
about your case. It's pretty serious.

626
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,960
So, you go to the doctor, you're not

627
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,919
feeling well. How did the physicians

628
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,400
respond to the observations you were

629
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,640
making about your own body? Yeah. So,

630
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,840
um, a lot of times it was very much a

631
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,159
dismissal. Um, it was kind of a a

632
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,799
dismissal of symptoms, um, over and over

633
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,000
and over again. just a well basically if

634
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,760
you would just lost a little bit of

635
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,440
weight you'd be fine. If you just lost a

636
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,039
bit of weight you could breathe better.

637
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,720
Um we don't really know what's going on

638
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,799
but if you just lost a bit of weight

639
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,039
everything would be okay. So after 3

640
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,960
years three years everybody looking

641
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,120
around you finally got a diagnosis. What

642
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,559
was really happening inside your body?

643
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,720
Uh, I had a tumor um in my left main

644
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,960
stem bronchus in my lung. Um, and it had

645
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,720
kind of killed the bottom half of my

646
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,720
lung and they had to take the whole left

647
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,240
lung out. In part cuz it took three

648
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,480
years, I think, to figure out what was

649
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,320
going on. Yeah.

650
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,360
What What was it like when you finally

651
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,559
realized you actually had a

652
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,960
life-threatening problem that was

653
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,640
causing this and not an issue with your

654
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,120
weight, which you never thought was the

655
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,480
problem to begin with? Um, it was the

656
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,640
first time that like I had finally

657
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,159
gotten a diagnosis and I spent so much

658
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,679
time trying to figure out what was wrong

659
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,039
with me and then somebody finally told

660
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,600
me that something was wrong and it was

661
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,360
just so freeing to realize that there

662
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,880
was something that was actually there

663
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,720
that like no, I'm not just fat.

664
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,799
Something is wrong in this body. So, I

665
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,520
wish you were the only person who felt

666
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,880
the way you have stated you felt because

667
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,480
it turns out that obese patients are 65%

668
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,400
more likely than others to have

669
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,120
significant undiagnosed medical

670
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,000
conditions. We write it off, say it's

671
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,520
something else. And sometimes it is the

672
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,120
weight is that's a problem, but often

673
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,440
times it's not. How you feeling okay

674
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,720
now? Yeah, I've been um cancer free

675
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,320
since 2012. Good for you. Good for you.

676
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,640
Thank you.

677
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,000
Latoya, let's talk about your story. Uh,

678
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,320
also an example of doctors overlooking a

679
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,880
real diagnosis. What happened? Well, in

680
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,520
my case, I've been in pain for the past

681
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,640
two decades. Um, since I started my

682
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,120
menstruation when I was about 10 or 11.

683
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,080
All I can remember is feeling this

684
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,320
crippling paralyzing pain every time my

685
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,720
menes would come about. When I went to

686
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,320
the doctor initially, it was, you know,

687
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,799
well, how about we give you some birth

688
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,320
control? When I started gaining like I'm

689
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,960
going to say I started gaining weight.

690
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,840
Um, particularly after I had my son, it

691
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,159
was automatically shifted to it has to

692
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,120
be your weight. So, your your doctors

693
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,039
actually finally found the real

694
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,640
diagnosis, right? What was going on? My

695
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,400
real diagnosis is that I was diagnosed

696
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,159
with endometriosis.

697
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,559
And that wasn't found until I miscarried

698
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,400
several times. Like over I stopped

699
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,039
counting after four times. Oh, I'm

700
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,400
sorry. And um it's something that so

701
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,799
many people brush off as it's nothing,

702
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,400
you know. It's I I find that's the issue

703
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,280
in a lot of things in reproductive

704
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,840
health. Well, the reason I'm passionate

705
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,760
about this topic of fat shaming is

706
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,919
because it can embarrass people and

707
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,520
people can do bad things to themselves

708
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,679
because they're ashamed by it. But we

709
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,280
also missed the real diagnosis, right?

710
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,960
Which is a much more obvious way that we

711
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,200
hurt people. Now, I should share Latoya

712
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,120
is about to run her 17th marathon in

713
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,640
three weeks.

714
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,440
So, you didn't get held back. Neither of

715
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,919
you did. What is your message to doctors

716
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,760
who are too easily writing off symptoms

717
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,760
to being to their patients being

718
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,400
overweight? Actually, listen to your

719
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,360
patients. Um, be patient with your

720
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,440
patients, you know. Um, essentially

721
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,960
don't just brush it off or just look at

722
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,000
them and then try to give them a

723
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,240
diagnosis. Actually do the work. Look

724
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,159
into it. Do blood tests, which I've had,

725
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,360
which proved that I didn't have some of

726
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,159
these things that they thought that I

727
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,840
had. Actually listen to us. Because when

728
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,480
you don't listen to us, then we have a

729
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,559
distrust. We have a worry and a real

730
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,200
fear that nobody's going to take us

731
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,279
serious. It makes people not want to

732
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,080
actually come to you. We we essentially

733
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,320
go to you to trust you. So, just listen

734
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,240
to us and know that this is not all in

735
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,000
our heads. We know our bodies more than

736
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,039
anybody else. Thank you for sharing your

737
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,039
story with us. We'll be right back.

738
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,240
Up next, fat shaving caught on tape. The

739
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,159
videos you have to see to believe. Find

740
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,159
out what got one woman kicked off a

741
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,159
flight.

742
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,000
That was a small taste of what got that

743
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,200
passenger kicked off a recent flight.

744
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,360
She called her seatmates big pigs, among

745
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,840
other things. Today, we're exposing fat

746
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,080
shaming caught on tape. Strangers

747
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,520
bullying and verbally abusing others

748
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,000
because of their weight.

749
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,880
It's a malicious and disturbing online

750
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,440
trend. Unrestrained and hurtful comments

751
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,200
shared in posts are leaving people

752
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,679
outraged and shocked. Hurt feelings,

753
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,000
some show no mercy. Looking at these

754
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,679
videos, you have to ask yourself, what

755
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,760
drives people to such hatred?

756
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,679
Norma, the woman who recorded that viral

757
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,080
video of her seat made publicly fat

758
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,440
shaming her, joins me now. First off,

759
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,679
thank you for coming to the show. Oh,

760
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,960
thank you for having me, Dr. Oz. Let's

761
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,000
go back to what happened when you first

762
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,080
got to your seat.

763
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,320
Getting comfortable, seated at the

764
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,679
window seat, um realizing that this

765
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,279
woman that was coming into the middle

766
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:17,600
seat was having a bad day. She wasn't a

767
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:20,640
happy person. Um, verbally saying

768
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,480
negative things and making it a little

769
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,039
uncomfortable. And how did it make you

770
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,080
feel when you appreciated what she was

771
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,720
really getting at? Uncomfortable.

772
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,880
Um, angry,

773
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,559
angrier,

774
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,159
and matter. Um,

775
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,520
that's why I started doing the outbur

776
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,679
the, you know, with her outburst, I

777
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,600
decided to go ahead and do the video and

778
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,799
she kept going even with your recording.

779
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,400
Yes. And she knew I was recording. So,

780
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,760
what prompted you to want to post it?

781
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,840
Because it does put you at risk, too.

782
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,080
You're so, you know, said the whole

783
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,400
thing is so embarrassing, of course, for

784
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,200
her because she's doing all this stuff.

785
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,840
I guess because as a nurse and I have a

786
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,520
platform, um, that I thought that

787
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,080
bullying and body shaming is

788
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,400
unacceptable behavior for children and

789
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,159
even more so for adults. Um, so I felt

790
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,799
the need to actually show this happening

791
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,080
to me. Good for you. Yeah. A lot of

792
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,200
people would have just pretended it

793
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,360
never happened and then it gets

794
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,600
tolerated. You travel a lot. Have you

795
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,279
ever been publicly

796
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,440
an attempt made to publicly shame you

797
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,080
like this? 15 years on the road and this

798
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,799
was truly a first. I'm on the road

799
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,520
almost every week and this was a first.

800
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,120
Yeah. And you probably at the you must

801
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,279
have at some point been disbelieving

802
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,320
this was even happening. I did. There

803
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,159
was a delay, but when somebody attacks

804
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,480
you and you're in the public, you can

805
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,720
get up and walk away. You're in a plane.

806
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,880
There's no place to walk to your

807
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,240
confined space. In fact, maybe it's been

808
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,600
that's the reason, but the airline

809
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,159
ultimately kicked her off. What was the

810
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,919
reason they gave for doing that? Well,

811
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,840
they saying that they had uh there were

812
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,399
so many people that were complaining

813
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,000
beside myself. Um, when I got off the

814
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,000
plane, there were people behind me when

815
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,520
we got off the plane in Newark that told

816
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,520
me that her behavior after I stopped

817
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,360
videotaping was she was still ranting

818
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,880
back there. So, the airline had to take

819
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,960
her off the plane for the safety of all

820
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,480
of the passengers. So, we reached out to

821
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
the airline. It was United Airlines. And

822
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,600
here's what they had to say about the

823
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,039
incident. United flight attendants care

824
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,399
about the safety and well-being of all

825
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,000
of our customers, which is why they

826
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,840
acted quickly to find a different seat

827
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,200
for the disruptive customer. When it

828
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,039
became clear that this passenger's

829
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,480
behavior was likely to be problematic on

830
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,200
this flight, she was provided

831
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,600
alternative travel arrangements first

832
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,120
thing the next morning. So, she spent

833
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,039
the night wherever you were coming from.

834
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,360
Looking back on that tape, why do you

835
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,279
think that woman was so angry? And I

836
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,960
don't think I'll ever know why she

837
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:47,520
behaved that way and why she thought

838
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,880
that was acceptable behavior.

839
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,880
Well, your brave desire to share that

840
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,840
experience resulted in a video that

841
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,840
attracted 600,000 views within a few

842
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,880
weeks. If you could talk to that woman,

843
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,799
and there's a pretty good chance she

844
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,279
might be watching this broadcast, what

845
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,279
would you tell her?

846
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,799
Um,

847
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,279
she needs to be healed. She needs to

848
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,039
look inside and determine why she

849
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,159
behaved that way.

850
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,840
um what is hurting inside herself that

851
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,080
makes her think it's okay to hurt other

852
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,679
people. Hurt people hurt people. Yes.

853
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,080
Hurt people hurt people. Hurt people.

854
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,720
And she needs to understand why she did

855
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,600
what she did. I am on the path of

856
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,640
forgiving her because as a woman of God

857
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,240
that is my job to forgive and move

858
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,559
forward.

859
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,240
This is a teachable moment which is why

860
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,240
I agreed to come on because this is a

861
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,880
teachable moment. Um, I would like to

862
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,840
take a quick moment just to apologize to

863
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,640
the United flight attendants. Um, cuz

864
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,960
they did an amazing job, but for my

865
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,399
language that I used in the video to

866
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,480
tell them I'm sorry for using that

867
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,200
language toward at them when I was

868
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,720
referring to the other woman. I don't

869
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,360
think you have to apologize for that.

870
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,760
God bless you. Yeah. Coming up, where's

871
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,760
the line between fat shaming and

872
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,080
concern? What should you do if you feel

873
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,320
like your doctor is fat shaming you?

874
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,320
Stick around.

875
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,760
Shocking updates on the House of

876
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,679
Horrors. Why the parents tortured their

877
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,200
own children. Louise Turpin's sister

878
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,440
reveals their intimate prison

879
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,840
conversations. Any expression of remorse

880
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,320
and Oz true crime investigation. That's

881
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,159
coming up on Wednesday.

882
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,640
Unfortunately, I was fat shamed a few

883
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,480
years ago. I went to the doctor um after

884
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,960
a car accident and he was supposed to do

885
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,279
some work on my back. Um, and while I

886
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,520
was there, he told me that I, at the

887
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,520
time, I was 100 pound, almost 100 pounds

888
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,799
heavier than I am now. Um, and he told

889
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,120
me I should just go ahead and have

890
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,399
beriatric surgery done. Um, because I

891
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,679
was never going to be able to lose the

892
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,279
weight naturally and I was just going to

893
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,200
be back in a few years asking for his

894
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,039
help. I was gaining weight like crazy

895
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,440
and I would go to my doctors for help

896
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,000
and all they ever said was to work out

897
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,679
harder, eat better. They said that I had

898
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,919
fat jeans. They said I would always have

899
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,000
a weight problem. They disregarded all

900
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,000
of my other symptoms and said I was

901
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,880
crazy. And this went on for about 8

902
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,200
years. And I finally did my own research

903
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,000
and discovered I had a brain tumor and

904
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,240
that was causing all my weight gain. And

905
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,240
a year ago, I had brain surgery. I had

906
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,720
the tumor removed. Since then, I've lost

907
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,200
40 lbs.

908
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,960
[Applause]

909
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,279
We're back with our investigation into

910
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,799
fat shaming. Could you be fat shamed by

911
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,960
your own doctor? Where's the line

912
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,480
between concern about weight and fat

913
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,559
shaming? Dr. Jennifer Codle joins us

914
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,480
now. We are hearing more and more

915
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,559
stories of patients saying they are fat

916
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,799
shamed by their doctor. But why is there

917
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,640
an increase? Well, first of all, this it

918
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,399
breaks my heart. This absolutely breaks

919
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
my heart as a family doctor to think of

920
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,760
to hear. And I'll be honest with you,

921
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,760
you know, we're doctors. I'm not

922
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,679
entirely surprised. And I don't actually

923
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,200
think this is new. I think we're hearing

924
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,640
about it more now because people are

925
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,480
willing to talk about it. We're willing

926
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,159
to record it. are willing to have

927
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,559
conversations and and things like social

928
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,799
media has really opened up the platform

929
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:06,960
to really share our stories and and

930
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,240
compare experiences. So, give us some

931
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,840
advice. Give the average person watching

932
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,760
some advice as a physician. How do you

933
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,559
know if your doctor's just, you know,

934
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,000
doing his best or crossing the line into

935
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,120
the shaming into the shaming area? Yeah.

936
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,039
You know, this is what I always say. I

937
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,960
say, "Trust your gut. If it doesn't feel

938
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,519
right, if you don't feel right, if you

939
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,320
feel shamed or humiliated or criticized

940
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,960
or embarrassed, you know what? Believe

941
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,200
yourself. Believe exactly how you feel.

942
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,279
And and and and a doctor wanting to do

943
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,679
the right thing does not excuse making a

944
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,240
patient feel any of those ways. That's

945
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,840
never okay. And I say as a doctor, we're

946
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,039
both doctors, but I'll say if you have a

947
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,559
doctor that makes you feel that way or

948
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,039
you're not comfortable, I'm giving you

949
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,159
permission right now to find a new one.

950
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,480
Let's see what some numbers are on this.

951
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,320
Studies have found hallelujah that

952
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,640
overweight women are less likely than

953
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,720
average to to get p preventative care

954
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,399
like pelvic exams and breast exam and

955
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,120
mammograms. I I there's no excuse for

956
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,799
this. No, but people treat overweight

957
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,480
people differently. What is the right

958
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,760
way for a physician to address a

959
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,720
patient's weight, do you think? Well, I

960
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,240
think there are a few things. And first

961
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,760
of all, as physicians, we've got to be

962
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,000
talking about this. Okay, these are

963
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,440
discriminatory practices. It's wrong. We

964
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,840
have to talk about it and be very

965
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,600
cognitive of this. But as physicians, we

966
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,080
need to talk with our patients. Let's

967
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,760
not talk at but talk to. We need to ask

968
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,120
our patients questions. What's your

969
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,399
journey? How do you feel about your

970
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,679
weight? You know, tell me what you've

971
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,000
what you've been doing, what you tried,

972
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,600
what your story is. Asking questions is

973
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,120
key. And something that we've also

974
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,200
talked about is this idea of never

975
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,880
dismissing a patient's symptoms just

976
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,080
because of their weight. That idea, we

977
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,320
shouldn't dismiss patients symptoms

978
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,399
because of anything, anything. We should

979
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,919
always be doing our due diligence. So,

980
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,640
this idea of saying, "Oh, it's your

981
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,399
weight." Just offhand, never okay in my

982
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,279
opinion. Um, and the last thing is, and

983
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,320
this is something a little bit

984
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,600
different. You know, I think in the

985
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,320
doctor's office, I'm a family doctor,

986
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,320
and do I take someone's blood pressure

987
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,039
out in a public space or do I take their

988
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,960
pulse or their temperature? No. Never.

989
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,799
But sometimes in doctor's offices,

990
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,480
people are weighed in public places,

991
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,240
either in the hallway or in waiting

992
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,919
rooms or things like that. And my thing

993
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,600
is, all of this should be private,

994
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,440
right? This is our personal protected

995
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,359
information. Uh, it's no one else's

996
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,440
business. So there are things as doctors

997
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,639
that we can do better to make this a

998
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,000
more comfortable and appropriate

999
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,679
situation. Yeah, you guys ought to feel

1000
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,040
comfortable insisting that for example,

1001
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,079
you wait because I don't want you not

1002
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,079
going to a doctor because you're worried

1003
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,919
about it. Weight's uncomfortable. I know

1004
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,000
that's true for a lot of us, but it's a

1005
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,000
necessary topic. So make sure you're

1006
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
talking about the doctor, not at with

1007
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,200
with folks as you care about it. So I

1008
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,119
want to bring in Norma, the nurse who we

1009
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,200
met earlier who was on the plane and

1010
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,119
being bullied for it. Come on up, Norma.

1011
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,720
What's the best way do you think a

1012
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,480
patient

1013
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,639
should be able to address their doctor

1014
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,040
if they're worried about weight issues?

1015
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,399
Letting the doctor know this is new to

1016
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,040
me. Um, this is unusual feeling. I've

1017
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,359
been feeling like this for two weeks or

1018
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,079
two months, putting a time frame to it.

1019
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,320
And if the doctor is still not asking to

1020
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,920
you, change doctors. Get always get a

1021
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,920
second opinion. That's right. Always get

1022
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,200
a second opinion. Thank you very much.

1023
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,790
Thank you. Let's call as always. We'll

1024
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,119
be right back.

1025
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:12,960
[Applause]

1026
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,880
I love getting to talk with you on my

1027
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,119
show every single day. But when the

1028
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,440
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

1029
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,440
is not over. I still have a lot that I

1030
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,240
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

1031
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,960
Oz podcast on Apple Podcast or wherever

1032
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,960
you get your podcast.

1033
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,560
It's a big day. Hey, I'm excited to

1034
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,200
announce the launch of my all-new Oz

1035
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,440
Guide. Their new quarterly single topic

1036
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
minis, little magazines, cute little

1037
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,960
things that will tackle some of your

1038
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,040
biggest health problems. Our very first

1039
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,640
issue will be on the news stands and at

1040
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,720
supermarket checkout counters later this

1041
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,720
month. It's an Oz approved plan

1042
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,920
featuring the healthiest fats around,

1043
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,079
which are mufas.

1044
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,960
Of course, you know, mufas are

1045
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,480
monounsaturated fatty acids. They're

1046
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,240
plant-based fats. So, the easiest way to

1047
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,240
remember them is to look for healthy

1048
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,480
fats that aren't from animal sources

1049
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:10,079
such as avocados come bouncing down. Or,

1050
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,800
you know what else counts? Nuts and

1051
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,240
seeds. They can really fill you up. And

1052
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,640
one of my favorites, olives,

1053
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,560
black, green stuff. So, there was a

1054
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,640
study done through the American Diabetic

1055
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,040
Association that found that a diet rich

1056
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,680
in mufas works to actually reduce belly

1057
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,960
fat. It's a big deal. But we don't want

1058
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,960
to want, you know, we don't really want

1059
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
these foods getting boring. All right,

1060
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,000
that's the problem. I know, I know

1061
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,640
you're thinking that. So, I've been

1062
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,960
hearing reports of nuts and seeds

1063
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,320
fatigue. Oh,

1064
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,960
shy away from this problem. And then

1065
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,119
there's avocado apathy. Nobody wants

1066
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,000
that. Making headlines. And then, of

1067
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,599
course, olive monotony. One of the worst

1068
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,320
problems to run into. Oh, I have

1069
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,040
challenged three Bite Club members to

1070
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,440
come up with new Mufalicious recipes in

1071
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,920
my first ever MUFA awards. This is a

1072
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,920
very serious competition.

1073
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,320
[Music]

1074
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,240
We have spared no expense as you can

1075
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,000
tell. I hope you're impressed by that.

1076
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,760
The MUFA Awards, the inaugural launched

1077
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,079
here. The dishes were judged by a team

1078
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,160
of tasters who are harsh people, tend to

1079
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,839
be sour and der in nature. So, I'll

1080
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,040
present their reports to you. Prior to

1081
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,800
the show, they tasted all these foods.

1082
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,680
The winner will take home our coveted

1083
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:28,939
golden avocado.

1084
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,939
[Music]

1085
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,000
So, I'm excited to hear what they make.

1086
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,800
Jenny came up with a new way to use nuts

1087
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,400
and seeds. What did you make? So, um I

1088
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:44,640
made a burger. Um I combined macadamia

1089
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:48,160
nuts, am um almonds, cashews, and pecans

1090
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:52,800
with a lot of seeds. pumpkin seeds, hemp

1091
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:56,160
seeds, sesame seeds, and um quinoa,

1092
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,440
mushrooms, olives, and there you go. You

1093
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,839
know, it could have been dry, but it's

1094
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,920
not. Very fulfilling. Tastes meaty

1095
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,440
without the meat and rich as you

1096
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,520
described. Nicely done. Thank you. All

1097
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,440
right. Next up,

1098
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,280
Robera came up with a next level way to

1099
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,040
use avocados. What did you do? You have

1100
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,160
a sweet tooth, don't you? So, I do.

1101
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,560
Secret agent chocolate pudding. Very

1102
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,440
clever. Diabolical. You know why? Why?

1103
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,000
Cuz our avocado is the secret agent.

1104
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,520
Now, this goes great with wine. Sorry, I

1105
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,480
just had to throw the wine in there. If

1106
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,720
you brought some wine, it could have

1107
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,560
influenced the judges probably. It's so

1108
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,920
decadent, so delicious. You wouldn't

1109
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,160
even know that there's avocados in

1110
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,079
there. It's very thick and it does fill

1111
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,920
your mouth. And it's very chocolatey.

1112
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,400
Nice combo. This is a very strong

1113
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,240
competitor event, but yours was too. But

1114
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,400
before we judge, thank you very much. We

1115
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,119
have Paula. Paula, what do you have? You

1116
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,480
have an olive looking item here. So, we

1117
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,160
have uh tah tahini filled uh hummus. And

1118
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,599
these are actually gluten-free crackers

1119
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,040
that are made from all those seeds that

1120
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,599
just fell from the sky over there. You

1121
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,040
love green olives. I do. Delicious. And

1122
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,160
a lot of people who eats hummus.

1123
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,320
Everyone eats hummus, right? Love

1124
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,320
hummus. So, I lighten the hummus up a

1125
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,800
little bit by adding some cauliflower.

1126
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,560
So, it Yeah. It lowers the It lowers the

1127
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,560
calorie count. You can't tell the

1128
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,760
difference. No. So, and then also this

1129
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,920
is a daicon radish. This is a carrot. 46

1130
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,520
calories. 10 calories. If you need a

1131
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,359
vehicle to get the hummus in your mouth,

1132
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,040
try daikon. Give me that daon. I like

1133
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,960
this idea. I, you know, you put a lot of

1134
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,839
garlic in this. I'm very proud of you. I

1135
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,440
did. It's delicious, isn't it? So flat

1136
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,640
hummus. All of these you will lose

1137
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,839
weight with if you eat them the right

1138
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,520
way. But

1139
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,680
I have the unfortunate and difficult

1140
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,160
task of revealing the winner. Are we

1141
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,400
ready for this? No hard feelings? All

1142
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:41,760
right. So, I've deliberated with the

1143
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,200
judges and the first ever MUFA award.

1144
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,079
And the person taking home the golden

1145
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,079
avocado today is

1146
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:55,320
Paula.

1147
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,320
Oh my goodness. Paula win. Paula,

1148
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,680
look at that. Don't worry. You like me.

1149
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,040
You really like me. I like all three of

1150
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,560
you actually cuz although you won this

1151
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,599
and that was fantastic. I got to say

1152
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,599
don't worry cuz we're going to be

1153
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,240
publishing both of your recipes in the

1154
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,720
book book the mini bookine. So I'm very

1155
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,240
proud of you. The guide to a fat belly.

1156
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,440
It's available on news stands and at the

1157
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,720
supermarket check out counters later

1158
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,920
this month. Check it out. Share it with

1159
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,440
your friends. And remember everybody,

1160
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,960
together change is happening. Our

1161
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,960
journey is just beginning. I'll see you

1162
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,960
next time. It's really good.
