00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,360
What is it in coffee that's raising

6
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,639
fears? If you could eat a cloud, this is

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,599
what it would taste like. A healthy

8
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,760
cloud.

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,320
We had the medical unit look into this.

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
I use these, but I don't trust these.

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,960
You got a bunch of burning health

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,130
questions, and I'm finding out the

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:31,920
answers. Coming up next.

[Music]

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,399
Is coffee really good for you? Dr. Oz,

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,800
should I really be using cooking spray?

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,520
Dr. bras. Do toilet seat covers really

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,399
protect you? Is there really a whipped

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,450
topping Dr. Oz approves of? Why can't

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,799
somebody just tell me once and for

25
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:10,320
[Music]

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,240
all? I'm just trying to close my eyes,

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
but I can't get these questions for my

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,520
viewers out of my head. So, today we're

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
going to unravel those health questions

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,680
that keep coming up. You know what they

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,759
say, the loudest voice wins out. Well,

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,759
let's start with Renata's big question.

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,920
Is there a whipped topping that I

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,400
approve of?

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,520
Who doesn't love a cloud of whipped

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,439
cream? It's so fluffy and sweet and it

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,600
crowns every dessert with a happy

38
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,560
halo. There's an explosion of whipped

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,400
wonders at the store. I've noticed that

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,640
there are tons of whipped creams and

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,479
toppings to choose from. You have

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,119
original, extra creamy, nonfat, and

43
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,200
light. They come in spray cans,

44
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:57,680
tubs, and some say they're even low

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,520
calorie. Can you tell me once and for

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,479
all, is there a whipped topping you

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,640
approve of,

48
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,759
Dr. Soath is here in person, and this is

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,040
Thanksgiving week, everybody. I know

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,959
you're all going to be indulging in

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,399
whipped toppings to add to your pies and

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,080
everything else. So, today we have

53
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
samples of some of the most popular

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,879
whipped items. For example, there's the

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,280
store-bought whipped cream in a can. Oh,

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,760
that sound. Isn't that amazing, guys? M

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,959
Whoa, yum, yum, yum. And we also have

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,640
the fat-free whipped topping also from a

59
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,120
store, right? I like Oh, look at that.

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,480
Look at that. So, so thick and luscious.

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,080
Now, here's the question for you. Pop

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,080
quiz. Look at these both, right? They

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,560
look similar, right? Which of these

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,000
barely contains any of this dairy? What?

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,000
What you talking about? What What are

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,360
you talking about? It barely contains

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,440
dairy. Yeah. One of these doesn't have

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,920
any dairy in it. They both had dairy in

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,760
it. They're cream. They're whipped

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,760
toppings and they have cream. The name

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,599
cream in it. So that means it must be

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,120
dairy in it, right? They taste like

73
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,720
they're creamy, but one of them doesn't

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
have it. Come on over. We're not I love

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,000
when once in a while we can impart a

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,840
little knowledge here. The first thing

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
we uncovered is that's easy to get

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,040
ripped off on whipped. So we're going to

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,040
go do a little comparison between

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,480
whipped and all the other comparative

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
products out there. Chef Danny Boom is

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,200
here with our whipped cream dream team.

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680
That's nice. Okay. I like that. Whipped

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,040
cream dream team. So, we're going to

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,920
start off with the oldfashioned homemade

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,200
whipped cream. So, you know what to

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
compare it to. Cuz the things I just

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,920
showed you actually weren't homemade.

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
But, you know, the closer you get to

90
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,400
homemade, the better off you are. This

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,000
has actually been around for a long

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
time, the homemade whipped cream from

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,159
the 16th century. It was known as snow

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,480
cream. And you talk about this being the

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,720
gold standard. What What do you say is

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,680
in here? And is it a concern? Is it bad

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,840
for you? How can natural ingredients be

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,000
a concern to anybody? That's the first

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,319
thing, right? We're talking about real

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,080
cream from a cow. Okay, that's the first

101
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,599
thing. We're talking about real vanilla

102
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,400
from a bean. And then we're talking

103
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,319
about real sugar from the cane. Okay,

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,920
that's what I want to see in my food.

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, when you whip it together, it's

106
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,519
just as quick. Okay, you have a metal

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,080
bowl that you freeze. You have a metal

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,239
whip that you whip it with and away you

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
go, guys. That's where you get it. Real

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,480
cream is what it's about. And I don't

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,439
want any synthetic stuff in my kitchen

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,840
giving me only 2%. There's only 2%

113
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,760
sometimes of any kind of dairy in a

114
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,919
synthetic product. This tastes to die

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,040
for. This is how I enjoy it as well. And

116
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,160
again, if it's created in the 16th

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,600
century, they didn't have a lot of

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,040
chemical processing back then. That's

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
right. Exactly. But the biggest thing

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,680
here is, okay, it may spoil, but that's

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
the good sign. If it spoils, it molds,

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,360
it spores, that's when we know something

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,360
is natural and is good for us. It also

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,840
actually it also gets rid of out of our

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,440
body quicker. We need full fat. All

126
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,080
right, he's preaching to the choir. You

127
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,360
ate full fat, Dr. Oz. Full fat. I heard

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,440
him. We need it. All right. Next cooking

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
nutitionist Rachel Beller here. She's

130
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
talking about whipped cream in a can.

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,960
Now, give a little bit of history here.

132
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,759
Whipped cream in a can was created in

133
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,440
1940s. Heralding convenience, lots of

134
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,800
memories, fond memories for a lot of us

135
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,360
who got to do what I just did over

136
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,960
there. This little maneuver. Oh, right.

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,360
It feels good. It looks good. It's

138
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,280
However, what's actually in it, Rachel?

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,759
So, we're not so real here. We have

140
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,320
thickeners, emulsifiers, there's cream,

141
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,479
there's milk, but all these things that

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,199
we're adding in. Some of these have 15

143
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,520
16 ingredients. Dr. Oz, that's a lot for

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,240
something so simple that Danny showed

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,479
us. So really, it's something that could

146
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,960
produce inflammation in the body. Not so

147
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,639
ideal when we want to get real. So been

148
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,080
around a long time despite the memories.

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,759
All right, let's get to the fat-free

150
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,759
whipped toppings which became popular in

151
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,560
the 60s, right? And a lot of people eat

152
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,560
these because they are low calorie. Yep.

153
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,320
Right out the And they do they do taste

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,000
good. But Danny, what ingredients did

155
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,000
you uncover that we did not expect? Oh,

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
here we go guys. Look at this. There's

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
Can you first of all, apart from being a

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
scientist like yourself, can anybody

159
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,000
else in the audience actually say the

160
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,600
first one? Hydrogenated oil. Okay,

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,400
that's the first thing. That's like palm

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,639
oil, canola oil. These are oils. They're

163
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,000
not dairy. It's not a protein, is an

164
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,960
oil. So, that's the preservative that's

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,960
holding everything together. It's an

166
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
emulsifier. Okay, then we look at the

167
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,960
next things down here. Additives.

168
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,039
Additives. Okay. Additives are

169
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,639
flavorings. Okay. That's what makes you

170
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,160
addicted to that. So fat free, but

171
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
there's a head fake here. Rana, what do

172
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,479
you think about that? Your take. Oh

173
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,639
gosh, I'm I'm troubled. Um I'm clutching

174
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
my pearls. I don't know what to do. I

175
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,680
have three cans of this stuff in my

176
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,800
refrigerator right now.

177
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,960
Um Dr. Oz, um however, I'm going to try

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,080
and do it a little bit more natural.

179
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,600
Well, here's the thing. Before you

180
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,280
judge, you you brought something up,

181
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,280
Danny, earlier about how long these

182
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,680
last. So my team was interested to see

183
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,120
just how much of a food fake out

184
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,120
storebought whips were. So we did a

185
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,400
little experiment to see how fast the

186
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,800
foods would spoil. Are you all

187
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,800
interested in that? Right. In theory,

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:58,839
it's supposed to spoil. Take a

189
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:58,839
[Music]

190
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,160
look. All

191
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:16,000
[Music]

192
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,360
right, here's what the whipped clouds

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,520
look like today. That's the old natural

194
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
16th century version. Not so appealing,

195
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,599
right? This baby here, I mean, it's just

196
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,880
deflated all the gas, but it did go bad,

197
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,880
right? Look at this. The whipped

198
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,440
topping, right? That didn't spoil at

199
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,360
all. That's still good to go. So, we did

200
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,039
some investigating and found some brand

201
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,039
new whipped toppings that are healthier.

202
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,800
I narrowed it down to just one that I

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,560
personally am obsessed with. I never

204
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,120
even thought about whipped chickpea

205
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
before. It's made actually from aquafaba

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,560
that you take the the juice of the

207
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,319
chickpea like this stuff down here. See

208
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
that juice? Wow. You take that juice,

209
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,039
it's sort of thick. I don't know if you

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,400
can all appreciate that, right? And you

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,759
whip that baby up and it looks like

212
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,360
this. So, I want my experts to please

213
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,879
taste that. Rachel, while you're doing

214
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,039
that, tell us a tiny bit about this. So,

215
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,599
I love aquafaba because you're basically

216
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,759
taking I take no sodium added liquid

217
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,120
from the chickpea and you just you whip

218
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,319
it up. Oh, now wait a minute. Yeah. You

219
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,599
could put maple, you could put a little

220
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,199
bit of honey. Mhm. So, this is a liquid

221
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,840
again that's in the can when you buy the

222
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,680
chickpeas, right? Yes. No sodium added.

223
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,240
Four ingredients compared to 16. This is

224
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,800
real. And you can This It's delicious.

225
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,360
Describe the taste.

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,319
You like it? It's It's light. It's

227
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,319
definitely light. fluffy, airy, airy.

228
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,840
It's It has a nice It's not overly

229
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,360
sweet, but it has a nice little sweet

230
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,959
texture. And there's this aftertaste

231
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
which is really really pleasant. And my

232
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,080
mouth smooth and my mouth doesn't feel

233
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,919
oily. If you could eat a cloud, this is

234
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,800
what it tastes like. A healthy cloud.

235
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,040
This is my first ever Oz approved first

236
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,720
ever Oz approved whip topping chickpea

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,959
whip. Try it out. The chickpea whip is

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,480
going to be famous. Coming up next are

239
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,080
Well, why can't someone just tell me

240
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,240
once and for all show continues? We

241
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,760
investigate coffee. Recent headlines of

242
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,959
cancer risks. Are they scaring you?

243
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
Should you be worried? Stay with

244
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,240
us. This is a first for me. I've covered

245
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,839
the events leading to crimes and the

246
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,720
aftermath, but I've never been inside a

247
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,120
prison to meet a criminal, to see what

248
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,440
it's really like to be in prison. No

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,360
cell phones allowed, no electronics,

250
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,920
just the minimal equipment for my crew.

251
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,600
An Oz true crime exclusive. And I've got

252
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,600
to say, when you think of a person in

253
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,200
prison for hiring a hitman, you're not

254
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,399
what I would imagine. All new Oz. That's

255
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,600
coming up tomorrow.

256
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,320
Hey, Dr. Oz. I read that they're putting

257
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,600
cancer warning labels on coffee in

258
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,279
places like in

259
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,040
California. Once and for all, how

260
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,240
worried am I supposed to be about my

261
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,440
daily coffee intake? Because I always

262
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,360
thought coffee was healthy.

263
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,320
It's the biggest coffee controversy

264
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,480
that's boiling over. Could coffee cause

265
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,160
cancer? Nutritionist Rachel Beller is

266
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
back along with coffee expert Dr. Bob

267
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,560
Arnold. They're joining me to

268
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,720
investigate. Guys, grab your coffee.

269
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,120
Let's head out to talk to the audience

270
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,720
about

271
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,600
coffee. So, we're enjoying our

272
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,600
coffee, but not 100% sure we should be.

273
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,880
So Rachel, you're from California and so

274
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,320
you've been living in a state where

275
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,480
there are now signs. Let me show this to

276
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,560
you. Signs in the coffee shops warning

277
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,680
people about coffee and cancer, right?

278
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,680
This is a pretty, you know, it's an

279
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,120
opposing warning sign. What is it in

280
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,800
coffee that's raising fears? So it's

281
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,440
acryumide which is formed when you're

282
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,440
roasting the coffee beans and the higher

283
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
the deeper the roast, the more acryumide

284
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,959
gets formed. The thing that's

285
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,560
interesting is that something like a

286
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,720
potato chip or French fries has 40 to 60

287
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,800
times the acryumide than our cup of

288
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,640
coffee. So, it's like a needle in a hay

289
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
stack. As a dietitian, I am not worried

290
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,519
about it. But the signs that I just

291
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,040
showed are only on coffee shops. They're

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,399
not putting them on French fries or

293
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,560
potato potato chip bags. That is

294
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,720
correct. In California, the signs are

295
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,320
up. Bob, your take on coffee and its

296
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,000
dangers specifically with regard to

297
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,320
cancer? Well, what you said, you know,

298
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,839
300 micrograms in a in a chip. you know,

299
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,760
seven on a cup of coffee doesn't seem

300
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,360
like much, but you know, the the really

301
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,040
good environmental chemists are going,

302
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,560
well, it's a liquid, could concentrate,

303
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,360
maybe said there's something there and

304
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
it is what's called a developing

305
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,839
carcinogen. They're looking, they're

306
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,079
testing, so there's no kind of final

307
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,600
answer, but the World Health

308
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,440
Organization, you know, you still list

309
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,839
it as a potential carcinogen. They've

310
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,000
given it a clean bill of health may uh

311
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,880
prevent up to two cancers and scientific

312
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,399
reports has 105 prospective studies

313
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,200
saying it may prevent everything from

314
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,040
prostate to colon cancer. Good. So all I

315
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,440
would say is to be safe the smartest

316
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,040
thing to do is drink a low acryomide

317
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,640
coffee. As Rachel said so well the

318
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,640
lighter roast have less in it. That

319
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,680
seems to make the most sense but I don't

320
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,959
worry about it. All right we got two

321
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,240
experts here are not worried about in

322
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,839
fact they're giving thumbs up to your

323
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,120
daily cup of Joe. They're not worried

324
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,040
about coffee and cancer. Are you all

325
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
happy about that?

326
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,240
They complain. I take away their

327
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,079
favorite foods. I get it all the time.

328
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,839
So, next question. What are the actual

329
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,440
benefits of coffee? Because I'm not a

330
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,120
coffee drinker. I don't react well to

331
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,639
it. As a surgeon, it's the worst thing

332
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,399
to have coffee before you head into the

333
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,920
operating room. Big problem because you

334
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,600
can't leave the O to take care of number

335
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,040
one and number two. That's right. So, I

336
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,560
never drank dent coffee. Plus, it looks

337
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,480
bad when you stay in your white jacket.

338
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,440
But, but there are studies every day

339
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,480
brewing uh about these these benefits.

340
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's go through these. Bob, walk us

341
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,519
through the strongest reason to drink

342
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,360
coffee. The first is to prevent the risk

343
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,279
of death. maybe including cancer. So,

344
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,200
the interesting thing is that coffee

345
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,600
used to be a marker for bad behavior.

346
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,839
People that that ate too much red meat,

347
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
they they smoked, they drank too much

348
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,880
alcohol, they didn't exercise, they

349
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
didn't have any vegetables in their

350
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,000
diet. It seemed like it was a market for

351
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,000
bad behavior. But these giant studies, 5

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
million consumer years, showed a

353
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,639
staggering 15% decrease in all cause

354
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,800
death for women, 10% for men. And you

355
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,560
know, there's nothing else like this in

356
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,360
the American diet. no food or new

357
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,680
beverage. It gives you that staggering

358
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,279
degree of decrease in death. Okay. How

359
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,639
about brain protection? And I bring it

360
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,480
up because it's the number one question

361
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,399
that especially older Americans have,

362
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,440
fear of dementia. So the interesting

363
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,120
thing, we actually did a study at the

364
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,920
North Carolina research campus with uh

365
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,399
Dave Neman and we showed a a big boost

366
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,880
in mood and we think that's because it

367
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,240
decreases bl brain inflammation. Good

368
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,760
studies on depression. out of the

369
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,000
Harvard School of Public Health. There's

370
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,360
a 20% decrease in the risk of uh

371
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,440
depression among women drinking four

372
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
more cups of coffee a day, Alzheimer's

373
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,880
disease, Parkinson's disease. Also, is

374
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,680
it because it's making you alert enough

375
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,519
to deal with stress better and you know

376
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
keep keep active intellectually? What

377
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,560
why does it work? So, the interesting

378
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,639
thing with the Alzheimer's, it may

379
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,720
prevent all those kind of you know

380
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,800
things getting onto the nerve endings

381
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,560
there, but they think it's basically a

382
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,959
decrease in inflammation. Now remember,

383
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,200
no one has done big prospective trials

384
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,040
proving this is a medication. It's just

385
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,040
an observation, but it's a good one. And

386
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,399
depression, fantastic. Well, if you can

387
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,920
reduce inflammation, which is the root

388
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,600
cause of so many problems, I'm in. Let's

389
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,959
head over to our coffee bar for the next

390
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,120
coffee question. We can settle right

391
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,600
now, right here. How many cups of coffee

392
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,199
a day is the right amount to drink for

393
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
the health benefits? Bob, since you've

394
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,720
articulated quite nicely that you're

395
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,320
passionately in favor of drinking some,

396
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,160
how much should we drink? New England

397
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,079
Journal of Medicine, men, five to six

398
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,440
cups of coffee a day. Harvard School of

399
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,839
Public Health. I know, trust me. Why

400
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,600
does six cups? Trust me, women, four

401
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,600
cups of coffee a day, 20% decrease in

402
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,399
the risk of depression. But if you are

403
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,000
like you and me and 45% of the

404
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,040
population, you take that much coffee,

405
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,720
you're going to have a SWAT team

406
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,040
following you down the highway, right?

407
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,519
Anxiety, wreck your sleep, ruin your

408
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,120
operation, right? And it could actually

409
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,600
be bad for you because your blood

410
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,519
pressure may go up. So the bottom line

411
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,760
is if you think you're sensitive to

412
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,680
caffeine, you can get away with just one

413
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,839
or two cups of super high polyphenol

414
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,000
coffee. We've gotten up to a thousand

415
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,360
milligrams in a cup versus 150 for a

416
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
lesser coffee. That's a great

417
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,920
workaround. The other good workaround is

418
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,079
a really high quality, say Ethiopian or

419
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,480
Mexican decaf that has all the

420
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,240
polyphenols. And the polyphenols, that's

421
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,320
the secret ingredient. That's what

422
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
causes the decrease in inflammation. So

423
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,079
you can get it. Lastly, that big New

424
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
England Journal study, it didn't say

425
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
caffeinated coffee. It just said coffee.

426
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,160
So, take it either way. All right. So,

427
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,360
again, two cups of caffeinated coffee or

428
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,800
if you're sensitive, you can have, I

429
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,800
don't know, four, five, six cups of

430
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,480
decaffeinated coffee without getting

431
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,600
symptoms that, but what you care about

432
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,120
is the fact that you're having some

433
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,480
coffee. Okay, you've got a little hack,

434
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
Rachel. A lot of times people adding too

435
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,519
much sugar to their coffee. It's a sugar

436
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,800
and cream that messed the coffee up,

437
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,399
guys. So, how do we get away without

438
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,560
adding on those things in, but adding in

439
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,560
some healthy ones instead? So, I treat

440
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,560
myself a couple times a week to what I

441
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,639
call a Turkish latte. I'm also a little

442
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,199
sensitive like you. And you're you've

443
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,959
got some of that Turkish uh in you. So,

444
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,199
health healthiest coffee there is is the

445
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,040
Turkish coffee. It is sometimes misnamed

446
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,720
Greek, but nonetheless, rich in

447
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,720
polyphenols, which is which is

448
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,519
fantastic. So, what you do is you can

449
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,519
take a shot or two of espresso, put it

450
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,839
in a a nutmilk. I try to avoid dairy

451
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,959
when it comes to coffee because um it

452
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,480
shows that it does decrease the

453
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,199
antioxidant value. It does reduce

454
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,120
polyphenols. So, I use cashew or almond.

455
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,600
And then here's something magical. I

456
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,320
love to power up my coffee with spice

457
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,959
synergy. There is research showing that

458
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,199
if you add cinnamon and ginger to

459
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,279
coffee, they work in sync and increase

460
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,440
the antioxidant value. Oh my goodness.

461
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:22,560
It's really cool stuff. Yes. So,

462
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,040
what I do is I add some cinnamon, some

463
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,639
ginger, some cardamom and clove. And

464
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,399
smell it. I mean, I'm really smelling

465
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,880
this. This is really good. This Rachel

466
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,560
is brilliant. It's just you're amping up

467
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,399
the nutritional value of what you're

468
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,720
drinking, what you're eating, just with

469
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,639
the power of spice. This will be the new

470
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,880
morning drink. This I'm serious. You

471
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,959
think I'm kidding? Rachel's Morning

472
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,480
Turkish coffee with cinnamon, ginger,

473
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,120
and everything else you add. No sugar in

474
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,800
this, right? No. No. You could add a

475
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,440
little bit of honey if you want to, but

476
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,959
I don't. It's just so good on its own.

477
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,720
So, cheers to that. Thanks for

478
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,560
enlightening us, making us feel better.

479
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,639
That's right. So, be sure to check out

480
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,880
Bob's book, Coffee Lovers Bible. You can

481
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,560
tell that he is one. Up next, do you use

482
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,079
cooking sprays? What you need to know

483
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,079
about what's really in them. Stay with

484
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,559
us. It's the return of jerky. This paleo

485
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,480
snack is now out selling chips. That is

486
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,640
so good. But could this low carb meat

487
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,439
treat have hidden ingredients that could

488
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,849
crash your diet? All new Oz. That's

489
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,169
coming up on Wednesday.

490
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,169
[Applause]

491
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,679
Cooking sprays. It's the kitchen item

492
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,679
that's always generating questions. And

493
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,200
today, I've turned my set into a test

494
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,640
kitchen to answer some of your burning

495
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,880
questions. Brooke and nutritionist

496
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,240
Rachel Bella have started an egg fry

497
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,520
experiment. So, what's your biggest

498
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,039
concern, Brooke, about these cooking

499
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,240
sprays? Is it better than regular oil?

500
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,360
Well, that's a pretty clear question.

501
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,280
What kind of oil do you currently cook

502
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,640
with? Uh, olive oil cooking spray. All

503
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,160
right. So, let's take a closer look at

504
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,000
the difference between olive oil in the

505
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
spray versus that in the bottle. We got

506
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,280
a little demonstration going on. You're

507
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,559
both racing. So, in a second, we're

508
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,960
going to find out how this is working.

509
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,559
Now, Rachel, you you just put flannel

510
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,320
olive oil on yours. Pure olive oil. And

511
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,720
this was sprayed. Yes, it was sprayed.

512
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,840
So, it makes a little slippery. Yes. I

513
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,799
While these are finishing up, can you

514
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,320
explain your perspective? Is it

515
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,160
nutrition? What's the difference? So,

516
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,039
with olive oil, what you see is what you

517
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,039
get. Pure olive oil. With a cooking

518
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,000
spray, now you're looking at additives.

519
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,840
And so, you know, you've got some um,

520
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,640
you know, anti- foaming agent like

521
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,080
silicone dioxide and uh, lecithin that a

522
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,880
lot of people are actually allergic to

523
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,320
soy and it's soy leithin. Got it. So,

524
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,160
there's something in there that they may

525
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,400
not be knowing about. And then we've got

526
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,480
the propellant to make it come out of

527
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
the can. And so, and that's something

528
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,080
also that is a little bit of an unknown.

529
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
It's what we use when we go camping. You

530
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,559
know, some of the propane kind of like

531
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,720
eat at your own risk thing going on.

532
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,840
Netn net does it which one's better for

533
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,919
taste and which one do you think is

534
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,120
healthier? So the olive oil is by far

535
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,960
healthier because you know you're

536
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,000
getting the pure thing. Some of these

537
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,280
oils they use chemicals and solvents to

538
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,880
you know to you don't know what you're

539
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,240
getting what kind of quality of olive

540
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
oil you're getting. Is there a taste

541
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,440
difference? I think there is. All right,

542
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,039
you guys ready? Let's just see how they

543
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,200
work first of all. Rachel, you you want

544
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,320
to go first or you're brave? Let's see

545
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,080
if it comes off. Go ahead. So it sort of

546
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,120
comes off. It's a little bit a little

547
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,039
harder, but you can pretty force it off.

548
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,480
It It made it It was not as elegant. Let

549
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,880
me see how yours does. Let's see how you

550
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,600
can do this. All right, let's see. Oh my

551
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,440
god. Don't even slippery. Don't even

552
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,440
need this. That is easier, but that

553
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,960
wasn't crazy hard either, right? So,

554
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,240
what And this nonstick, we understand

555
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
why it's happening because of the

556
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,559
chemicals in here. Yes. You recommend a

557
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
specific kind of oil if you're going to

558
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,720
spray that you think is a little better.

559
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,039
So thankfully in the marketplace we do

560
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,120
have like for example this is avocado

561
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,280
oil spray and if you look at the

562
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,400
ingredient list there's one ingredient

563
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,400
avocado oil and they even bother to tell

564
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,799
us that it's expeller pressed no

565
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,240
chemicals no solvents no treating it

566
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,280
with harsh chemicals to dilute the

567
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,200
antioxidant level. Oh and it heats up to

568
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,240
500°.

569
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,600
So see what's wrong with that? It's

570
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,480
awesome. Have you ever heard of it

571
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,400
before? No. This is a great idea. This

572
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
is a gift from the show to you. It's a

573
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,440
little something for your effort coming

574
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,919
today. This is a great idea. It's great.

575
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,960
It's inexpensive. Really, really great.

576
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,480
All right. Thank you. Now, Stephanie's

577
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,600
here along with her question with Chef

578
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,360
Danny for a spray experiment.

579
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,520
So, Stephanie, what is concerning to you

580
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,080
about these sprays? Well, I'm using a

581
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,000
zerocalorie spray. So, is it actually

582
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,520
zero calories?

583
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,360
Ah, what's the deal with this? It says

584
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,159
zero calories, doesn't it? It It says

585
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,600
zero calories, but zero calories. This

586
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,000
is really really interesting. So zero

587
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,000
calories to the FDA, okay, is a serving

588
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
suggestion. Okay, so it comes down to

589
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,039
one serving suggestion can be basically

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,679
five calories or

591
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:51,600
0.5 grams. Okay, so but here's the

592
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,559
thing. When you one spray is going to

593
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,360
give you that, but how many times do you

594
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,679
spray to cover the surface of the pan?

595
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,480
What's a spray mean? In terms of time,

596
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,080
one pump. Well, that comes down to

597
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,080
oneird of a second. A third of a second.

598
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Yeah. So, I've got a little competition

599
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,760
for you here, doctor. All right. Okay.

600
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,120
What we're going to do, Stephanie's got

601
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,880
some spray. You've got some spray. We've

602
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,880
got two pans. And come on, everybody

603
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,039
here. Do you think they really could

604
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,360
cover the surface of the pan with one

605
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,120
pump? We're going to try. Yes. Try.

606
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,880
Okay. You're going to try. So, what I

607
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,240
got is I've got a stopwatch here. And as

608
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,039
I'm wearing my apron, it I look

609
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,919
official. You do. Okay. So, we're going

610
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,200
to give it a one, two, three. We're

611
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,000
going to spray. And then we're going to

612
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,520
sit. Just one pump. One. Okay. Okay.

613
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,440
Because I know you're competitive, Doc.

614
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,799
Okay. One pump. And we're gonna see how

615
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,159
much we spray. And then we're going to

616
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,840
go back and then we're going to realize

617
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,600
how much we actually do put into the

618
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,600
pan. A third of a second. Right. No

619
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,520
cheating. No cheating. No cheating. Hey.

620
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:58,559
Do I have to get serious here? Okay.

621
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:59,840
Right. Okay. So, three, two, one. Stop.

622
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,360
You went longer than a third. No, I

623
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,320
didn't. Yes, you did. I saw you. I think

624
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,080
you went a little over the line.

625
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,480
Absolutely did. But what we've got here,

626
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,000
if we just went, if we can continue

627
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,840
this, look at how the pan goes. That's

628
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,679
not going to work real. Okay, you could

629
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,440
get an egg going on there. And remember,

630
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,960
if you're using a non-stick pan, the

631
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,960
first thing is you don't have to use the

632
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,280
oil. If you want to distribute the oil

633
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,799
in an even sense, use some paper towel

634
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,960
and maybe some olive oil. But in

635
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,799
fairness, I that that no one's going to

636
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,000
do one/ird of a second. You can't spread

637
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,320
it that quickly. Well, let's come back

638
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,880
to the calorie question. Yes. Okay. If

639
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,120
we've just used one pump, okay, well,

640
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,799
that's five calories. Okay. But if you

641
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,559
continue to keep doing that, the

642
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,480
calories are going to keep mounting up.

643
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,760
You could end up with 35 calories.

644
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
That's what it would take. Okay. So

645
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,720
that's probably about 25 30 calories

646
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,240
there right now. Well, it turns out we

647
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,679
had the medical unit look into this.

648
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,200
Right on. And the average person would

649
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,200
probably spray for close to 3 seconds.

650
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,960
We think it's about 30 calories, right?

651
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,559
With roughly. So it's actually not a

652
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,559
zero calorie additive. In which case,

653
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,000
you think, is there a hack? So you

654
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,600
mentioned a good one, but I'm going to

655
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,760
go one up here. This new beautiful

656
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,200
technology. It's just a bottle with a

657
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,360
pump. All right. Nothing fancy. But

658
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,919
listen, put real olive oil in here. And

659
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,280
then when you spray, watch. Oh, I

660
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,720
missed. I missed. Sorry. See, and you

661
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,480
can do that. And now you know exactly

662
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,039
what you're getting. And this is a

663
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,240
little gift to you. A little olive oil.

664
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,600
You take whatever hack you want, but

665
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,360
there are ways of getting around this if

666
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,880
you don't want to do it on. Exactly.

667
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,559
Thanks for helping me solve the

668
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,000
experiment. Hope you enjoyed the

669
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,000
competition. Congratulations on your

670
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,840
victory. Bottom line, guys, try avocado

671
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,440
spray for a less bird taste and be aware

672
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,039
of how long you spray if you're worried

673
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,480
about the calories. Up next, do you ever

674
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,480
use a toilet seat cover when you're in

675
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,720
the public

676
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,799
restroom? Do you ever do that? Some

677
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,799
yeses and some nos. Find out what our

678
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,559
swabbing investigation revealed about

679
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,280
the germ protection they really give

680
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,280
you. Stay with us.

681
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,000
Ready for this? It's the dish on Oz, our

682
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,640
brand new food series. Get tasty. Daffy

683
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,480
Oz and friends.

684
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,240
We're serving it up every Wednesday in

685
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,240
November. The dish on

686
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:08,320
[Music]

687
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,240
us. So, let's be honest. Who uses one of

688
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,080
these right in the toilet bowl? All

689
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,679
right. During one of my shows brainstorm

690
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,320
sessions, I learned that my team and you

691
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,240
at home have a lot of questions about

692
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,080
disposable toilet seat covers. For the

693
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,320
first time, we did a swabbing survey in

694
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,640
public restrooms to find out if this

695
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,000
actually protects you or not. Comedian

696
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,320
Chuck Dice, who's a self-proclaimed

697
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,279
toilet expert, is here. You are one of

698
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,640
the skeptics. Yes. Of these covers.

699
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,000
What's your beef with them? You know,

700
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,279
here's the deal. First of all, when it

701
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,480
comes to toilets, that's where I'm a

702
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,799
Viking. Okay. Seriously, I do a lot of

703
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,200
traveling. All right. And I have a lot

704
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,840
of fiber and roughage in my diet. So,

705
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,240
there's a lot of public restrooms in my

706
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,960
life. Okay? That's all I'm saying. Now,

707
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,520
I use these, but I don't trust these.

708
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,480
Okay. Now, what I really do, Dr. Oz, is

709
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,880
I go get paper towels, swab them full of

710
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,200
soap, and clean the toilet. Then, I put

711
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,240
this down on it. So, that's really into

712
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,080
it. Yeah. All right. So, we did our own

713
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,159
experiment in public restrooms to find

714
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,600
out if they're protecting you or not.

715
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,360
Rat is standing by with two audience

716
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,279
members in an undisclosed

717
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,679
location. So, hey, Dr. eyes. Everyone

718
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,600
has their own way of getting over the ew

719
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,840
factor. I mean, the nastiness of using

720
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,320
the public bathroom. Sometimes it

721
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,799
doesn't go the way that we want it to,

722
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,679
but there's two techniques that we have

723
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:33,360
right now. So, right now, the first one

724
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:37,200
is, oh my goodness, we pull out the

725
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:40,960
toilet seat cover and sometimes it falls

726
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,279
in the middle of the toilet and that

727
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,279
makes it really wet and nasty. So, I

728
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,600
mean, we don't want that, right? But

729
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,799
sometimes that happens. The second one

730
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,320
is the DIY method. You know what that

731
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:58,240
is? Oh my goodness. We saturate the

732
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:01,200
toilet seat cover with tissue in hopes

733
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,960
that we won't be getting germs from the

734
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,600
toilet. So, that's what happens in the

735
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,600
toilet. So, we swabbed public bathroom

736
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,760
toilets with the covers on the standard

737
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,440
way. Then, we have Ariel's way and we

738
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,799
have Nicole's method. Right. The big

739
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,240
question, do these covers actually

740
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,480
protect you from germs? So, Renata,

741
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,440
Ariel, Nicole, come on out here with the

742
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,400
results from our public restroom survey.

743
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,520
Here they come. Now, according to our

744
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,679
small data sample of public restrooms,

745
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,279
we conducted our swabs using a germ

746
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,440
device. You know, these devices gives

747
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,880
you all a score, right? So, my med unit

748
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,120
ranked you guys. Are you ready for the

749
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,520
results? Yeah. Little nervous. All

750
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,200
right. No. Without any toilet cover,

751
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,720
seat cover at all, the kind of toilet

752
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,480
that that Chuck would never sit on. He

753
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,799
would wash first. 337 was a germ score.

754
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,960
Oh gosh. Not so good. Right. All right.

755
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,480
Now, with the toilet seat cover on the

756
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,320
standard way, which I'll explain in a

757
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,120
second what that is, we found a germ

758
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,760
score of three. Oh, that's fantastic.

759
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:03,039
Okay. All right. Now, if we modified it

760
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,080
with the wet method like Ariel, we got a

761
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,799
germ score of 39. Oh, that's a lot more

762
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,480
than three. If you make a DIY toilet

763
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,400
toilet paper halo like the Nicole did

764
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,279
and Chuck likes to do, right, you get a

765
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,279
germ score of 12. That's not bad. Not

766
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,480
bad. Right. But it's not any better.

767
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,159
It's certainly easier to take that thing

768
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,159
off there. So, Ariel, will you

769
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,760
reconsider wetting your seat cover

770
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,159
before you sit on it? Of course, you

771
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,919
will. No more wetting. Doesn't it bother

772
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,159
to be wet down there like that anyway?

773
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,679
How do you dry it off? Is that too many

774
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,880
questions? All right. All right. All

775
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,480
right. So, we settled that disposable

776
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,360
toilet seat covers will protect you.

777
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,960
That's what we're going to go with. Now,

778
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,400
let's come over here. One last thing we

779
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,039
got to settle is what do you do with

780
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,880
that darn flap in the middle of the

781
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,240
cover? Right. My question, too. All

782
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,159
right. So, you got you got this toy

783
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,159
cover here. One second. The flap. The

784
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,480
flap. So, here's the deal. Because I do

785
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,799
this so much. All right. The flap

786
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,919
everybody thinks goes in the back

787
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,760
because, you know, it seems intuitive

788
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,039
like this is the shape of the toilet.

789
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,240
So, the flap should be in the back.

790
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,080
Still catch anything. It goes behind

791
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,919
you, right? So you might might it might

792
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,520
act as a catch but no people. No, that

793
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,320
is not how this works. Okay, this goes

794
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,080
in the front. All right, first of all, I

795
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,679
am already feeling so much better about

796
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,399
my life just putting this

797
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:22,799
down. My life feels safer right now. My

798
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,960
life feels safer. Okay. But it goes in

799
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:30,240
the front so that when you

800
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:33,120
flush this water grabs this part and

801
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,799
pulls it in and you don't have to touch

802
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,720
it.

803
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,919
It's genius.

804
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,559
Oh my god. Why am I so happy? Did you

805
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,320
have any idea? I had no idea. I never

806
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,679
touched the thing. I'm with Chuck Knife.

807
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,840
I mean, I get in there and I get to

808
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,360
scrubbing. I lock doors. I get to

809
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,760
scrubbing. But I had no idea. This will

810
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,880
change everyone's life. Put the flap in

811
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,840
the front. I didn't realize. I don't

812
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,200
know. How How did you figure that out?

813
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,039
What's that? How'd you even figure that

814
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,240
out? That is so cool. All I can tell you

815
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,440
is disaster taught me. Okay, now you all

816
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,039
know. Now you feel safe. We're going to

817
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,960
put Chuck's toilet tutorial. We're going

818
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,039
to call it that. Chuck Nice's toilet

819
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,399
tutorial on my website next. I I got

820
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,840
more to go, right? Actually, you know

821
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,679
what? I just got to go myself. But in

822
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,600
the meantime, when we come back, I have

823
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,279
more public bathroom debates to settle.

824
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,720
Should you use hot or cold water when

825
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,640
washing your hands? You know about that?

826
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,559
Yes, I do. We'll find out. And should

827
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,200
you use a hand dryer? Is that the way to

828
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,200
move? Stay with us.

829
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,799
Wife, mother, grandmother. How one woman

830
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,440
hired a hitman to kill her daughter's

831
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,960
best boyfriend. I go behind bars for an

832
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,520
exclusive interview with Melissa

833
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,760
Shfield. That's coming up tomorrow. Hey

834
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,279
guys, I'm here in the bathroom. We're

835
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,520
answering your biggest handwashing

836
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,600
questions. Starting with, is hot or cold

837
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,360
water more effective to wash your hands?

838
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,080
Find out what YouTube science star Nick

839
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,080
Yuas has

840
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:57,440
uncovered. Everybody knows you're

841
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,520
supposed to wash your hands with hot

842
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,520
water because it kills more germs.

843
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,880
Obviously, your mother, your father,

844
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,520
even your sixth grade health teacher,

845
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,799
Mrs. Schmullenberger, told you that. But

846
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,640
were they

847
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:12,320
right? As it turns out, the hot water

848
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,840
that we use to wash our hands is only

849
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,320
between 100 and 130° F. And water needs

850
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,640
to be over 212 degrees Fahrenheit to

851
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,200
kill bacteria. And at this temperature,

852
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,440
our skin would burn, leaving us with an

853
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,520
even bigger problem on our hands.

854
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,559
Really, it's the soap and friction that

855
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,559
removes the unwanted bacteria. Fun fact

856
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,880
for you, neither the Center for Disease

857
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,120
Control or the World Health Organization

858
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,340
actually specifies what temperature to

859
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,399
wash your hands. Sorry, Miss

860
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:44,240
[Music]

861
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:46,640
Schmullenberger. Yep. At 212 degrees,

862
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,399
water boils. So, to show you what would

863
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,159
happen if I washed my hands with this

864
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,399
water, I'm going to go ahead and dunk my

865
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,919
hand down into this. I'm just kidding.

866
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,840
I'm use my cameraman's hand. There we

867
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,279
go. Yeah. Come on. It's okay. Okay.

868
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,760
Okay. Okay. I'm just kidding. I'm going

869
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,930
to use this steak to represent the skin

870
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,999
on my

871
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,999
[Music]

872
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,240
hand. It's a pretty good piece of steak.

873
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,000
What's most important when washing your

874
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,960
hands is rubbing your hands together to

875
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,799
cause friction for at least 20 seconds,

876
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,960
about the same amount of time to sing

877
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,020
happy birthday. Happy

878
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,880
birthday to

879
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,559
[Music]

880
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,080
me. So, don't forget to rub those hands

881
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,600
while you wash them. But what happens

882
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,360
after you wash your hands? The next

883
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,159
question everyone just wants answered

884
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,600
is, should you use paper towels or a

885
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,039
hand dryer? Take a look at the

886
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,990
experiment that health expert Peter

887
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,120
Deluchia

888
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:42,640
[Music]

889
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,000
did. If you choose hand dryers because

890
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,159
you think they're the most hygienic

891
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,039
choice at a public restroom, think

892
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,760
again. A new study says hand dryers are

893
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:55,600
germ spreaders responsible for spraying

894
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,679
bacteria all over. To see if that's true

895
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,760
or just a bunch of hot air, I conducted

896
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,919
a little experiment. But first, a few

897
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,760
facts.

898
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,840
One reason dryers spread germs is

899
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,640
because people have germs on their hands

900
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,200
even after they wash them. Why? Because

901
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,480
only 5% of people wash long enough to

902
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,840
kill infection-causing germs and

903
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,559
bacteria. And only a third of

904
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,320
handwashers use soap. This means germs

905
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,640
are often still on our hands when they

906
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,919
go under the

907
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,279
dryer. Now, back to the experiment.

908
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,960
You're probably wondering why I'm

909
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,279
wearing this hazmat suit. Well, to

910
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,360
protect me from this paint. Think of

911
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,840
this paint as the bacteria and germs

912
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,600
left on your hands after you wash them.

913
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,120
I'm going to put my hands in here and

914
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,960
then we're going to go underneath the

915
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,960
high-speed dryer and let's see what

916
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,880
happens. All on my pants, all over the

917
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,240
wall. What a bacteria

918
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,000
mess. So, we found that if you don't

919
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,080
wash your hands well enough, hand dryers

920
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,080
can spread the germs. But what about the

921
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,760
hand dryer itself? Can it spread germs

922
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,200
to when you clean your hands under it?

923
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,840
Well, we dry your hands under it. So, my

924
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,519
med team researched this and tested 12

925
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,159
hand dryers from across Manhattan and

926
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,679
found that all but one were germfree.

927
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,799
And that that one had germs at such a

928
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,399
low level that it's not really a

929
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,039
concern. So, hand dryers, everybody,

930
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,600
they are safe. They are good to use. But

931
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,360
what about the paper towels, right? We

932
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,840
test the paper towels and they have a

933
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,440
low germ score as well. So low that

934
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,120
there isn't a reason to be concerned.

935
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,640
Paper towels from the dispenser are

936
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,399
safe. So, if you're worried about

937
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,480
getting out of the bathroom germ free,

938
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,080
here's a helpful hack that moms often

939
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,519
tell you to do. You take the paper

940
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,320
towel, right? Dry your hands off. Use

941
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,480
the paper towel to open the door, get

942
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,399
out of the room, and toss paper towel

943
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,600
away. Contamination free. We'll be right

944
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,600
back. Learn something new every day.

945
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,720
It's the return of jerky. This paleo

946
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,640
snack is now out selling chips. That is

947
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,799
so good. But could this low carb meat

948
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,679
treat have hidden ingredients that could

949
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,250
crash your diet? All new Oz? That's

950
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,639
coming up on

951
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:10,240
[Applause]

952
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:11,760
Wednesday. It's one of my favorite

953
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,960
phrases and I don't get to say it

954
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,639
enough, so I'll do it right now.

955
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,000
0. Right? We all want things for less,

956
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,200
especially if they can improve our

957
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,960
health. So, here's a question for all

958
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,599
you. Which of these items can you get

959
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,240
for $0? Can you get a cup of coffee for

960
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,800
$0? Or a pack of gum? How about a

961
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,839
newspaper, which they're both on, right?

962
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,280
Not so easy. Or how about a health

963
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,720
insurance plan that may include access

964
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,399
to wellness programs, to vision, dental,

965
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,639
hearing benefits, may even include

966
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,800
prescription coverage. Right? Which one

967
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,639
can you get for

968
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,720
$0? Right? If you guess these, you're

969
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,240
right because it's available now for

970
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,240
some folks. Believe it or not, it is

971
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,599
possible to get health insurance plans

972
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,240
now with a $0 monthly premium. Millions

973
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,760
of people already are doing it and so

974
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,040
could you. Which is why I'm going to

975
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,960
take a few seconds here. I want to talk

976
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,880
about healthcare today because I know it

977
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,240
can be expensive. I hear from you all

978
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,000
the time. So, let me walk you through

979
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,520
this a little bit. You only have so much

980
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,680
money in your piggy bank, right? It's

981
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,000
just only so much there, right? And

982
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,520
counseling and gym memberships, right?

983
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,599
They can cost a little bit of money and

984
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,680
and so these programs can sort of build

985
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,720
up. Prescription drugs can cost a lot of

986
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,040
money, especially if you have to take

987
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,040
more than one. Plus, you got dental and

988
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,320
vision and hearing coverage, right? And

989
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,160
no wonder it feels like your piggy bank.

990
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,880
It just begins to melt away in front of

991
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,119
you to almost nothing. But Medicare

992
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,880
beneficiaries have another option. With

993
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,760
Medicare Advantage, you can get a plan

994
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,760
with $0 monthly premium, which could

995
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,599
mean lots more money in your piggy bank,

996
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,599
which is the goal here. Here to tell us

997
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,119
more is Jalisa Jackson, who's here on

998
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,079
behalf of my trusted sponsorship

999
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,320
partner, medicare advantage.com. Jalisa

1000
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,240
is an experienced licensed insurance

1001
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
agent who has helped thousands of people

1002
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,000
learn about their Medicare options,

1003
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,599
which is why I trust her. So Medicare

1004
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,839
Advantage, walk folks through what it

1005
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,599
is. Awesome. So a Medicare Advantage

1006
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,119
plan is an option for our Medicare

1007
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,200
beneficiaries who are actually looking

1008
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,720
to expand their coverage. These plans

1009
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,960
are offered by private insurance

1010
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,839
companies and provide the exact same

1011
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,240
coverage as your Medicare parts A and B.

1012
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,079
However, a lot of these plans do provide

1013
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,760
you with additional benefits that a lot

1014
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,520
of people need, such as prescription

1015
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,760
drug coverage, as you mentioned, the

1016
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,839
dental, the vision, hearing, and

1017
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,680
wellness programs. And I found that

1018
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,079
those are game changers for a lot of

1019
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,000
people looking to expand their coverage

1020
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,400
because original Medicare doesn't

1021
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,640
provide services for any of those items

1022
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,040
that I just named. Medicare Advantage

1023
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,200
plans also include what we call a annual

1024
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,079
maximum out-ofpocket limit. So, if you

1025
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,359
have a medical emergency or costly

1026
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,359
procedure, you're only guaranteed to

1027
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,000
spend a certain dollar amount for the

1028
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,320
year before the plan picks up. And

1029
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,160
that's really great. That's a valuable

1030
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,640
layer of protection because if you just

1031
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,079
have Medicare parts A and B, there's no

1032
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,000
cap to how much you can spend out of

1033
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,359
pocket in a year. So, how many of these

1034
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,520
plans are there out there? They sound

1035
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,440
good. It really is a lot to get out of

1036
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,119
one plan. And honestly, Dr. ized.

1037
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,680
There's no other option on the market

1038
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,680
like this for our Medicare

1039
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,560
beneficiaries. Over 2,000 Medicare

1040
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,680
Advantage plans are available

1041
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,040
nationwide. And most of our Medicare

1042
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,200
beneficiaries do have access to the Z

1043
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,520
premium plans depending on the area that

1044
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,640
they live in. I would think if I could

1045
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,240
get potentially 0 expense for some of

1046
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,920
the things we just talked about, I'd be

1047
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240
signing up. So why are not more folks

1048
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,520
signed up? Well, actually over 20

1049
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,440
million people are currently enrolled

1050
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,280
into a Medicare Advantage plan. So

1051
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,079
that's a lot of people. However, that's

1052
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,440
only about a third of our Medicare

1053
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,599
beneficiaries. So there's still millions

1054
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,680
of people who can have a Medicare

1055
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,920
Advantage plan, you know, with less

1056
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,599
cost, more benefits if they simply just

1057
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,200
look into it. Yeah. Can I speak to the

1058
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,480
audience on this? I I bet a lot of folks

1059
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,599
are sitting at home right now thinking,

1060
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,599
I'm just not going to think about this

1061
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,839
right now. Right. Seriously. Right. So

1062
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,440
since this show started right almost,

1063
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,160
you know, 10 years ago, enrollment in

1064
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,160
Medicare Advantage has increased by over

1065
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,240
70%. The fact is everyone around you is

1066
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,760
signing up, which is why I want you just

1067
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,599
to focus and see if it makes sense for

1068
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,520
you. If it doesn't, it's fine, but if it

1069
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,760
does, stop waiting on the sideline. So

1070
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,280
how can folks sign up today? So now is

1071
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,119
actually the best time to do it because

1072
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,119
it's Medicare's open enrollment until

1073
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,960
December the 7th. And for a lot of

1074
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,320
people, this is the only time of the

1075
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,400
year to get a Medicare Advantage plan.

1076
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,760
That's

1077
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,760
good. I'm lucky we're doing it today.

1078
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,280
So, navigating this can be tough. So,

1079
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,800
and let know Medicare itself can be

1080
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,160
difficult to understand. So, I want you

1081
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,520
to get the right decision and make it

1082
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,880
the right way. So, I want to take your

1083
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,359
questions. So, put your hands up if

1084
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,880
you've got a question. Who's got who you

1085
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,040
are here? Go ahead. Take it away, ma'am.

1086
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,599
So, who will be eligible for this

1087
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,280
Medicare Advantage plan? Oh, that's a

1088
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,680
great question. So, generally, if you

1089
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,040
currently have your Medicare parts A and

1090
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,359
B or someone 65 years of age or older or

1091
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,960
under 65 with qualifying disabilities

1092
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,200
will qualify for a Medicare Advantage

1093
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,000
plan. Okay. Is your mind being changed a

1094
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,480
little bit? Perhaps. Perhaps. Good. I

1095
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,800
like that. A very discerning viewer. Go

1096
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,720
ahead. Take it away. Now, can my husband

1097
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,320
and I be on on the same insurance plan

1098
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,040
or do we have to each have our own

1099
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,040
separate plan? Awesome. So, actually the

1100
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,960
Medicare Advantage plans aren't family

1101
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,200
plans. So each of you would have to

1102
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,440
enroll, but the good thing is these

1103
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,960
plans are based on your needs. So your

1104
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,960
husband's needs may be different than

1105
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,880
yours. So he can have his own plan and

1106
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,920
you can have yours. Awesome. That's

1107
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,000
perfect. It is right.

1108
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,440
She's more optimistic about this idea.

1109
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,040
All right. I think look, I I don't I'm

1110
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,480
not want to sh you know, I want to nudge

1111
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,560
you. I don't want to shove you, but

1112
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,079
think about this because 70% increase

1113
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,280
since I started the show means a lot to

1114
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,599
me. All right. Who's got the last

1115
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,320
question? Take away. You said now is a

1116
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,200
good time to sign up. Are there any

1117
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,200
other times we have that option? Yes.

1118
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,640
So, now is actually the best time of the

1119
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,400
year because it's Medicare's open

1120
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,320
enrollment until December the 7th.

1121
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,920
However, there are other times to

1122
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,640
enroll. It's just depending on your

1123
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,640
circumstance. Thank you. What I'm

1124
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,320
hearing is stop waiting on the sideline.

1125
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,000
Is that what you're all hearing? It's

1126
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,880
the time of the year. Take a moment,

1127
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,800
think about it, decide now. So medicare

[Applause]

1140
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,200
Wife, mother, grandmother. How one woman

1141
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,760
hired a hitman to kill her daughter's

1142
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,359
best boyfriend. I go behind bars for an

1143
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,690
exclusive interview with Melissa

1144
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:49,079
Shfield. That's coming up

1145
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:51,920
[Applause]

1146
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:54,880
tomorrow. Today, the most Googled health

1147
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,480
symptoms in the country. What is a top

1148
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,079
health question in your state?

1149
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,839
Wisconsin. Well, they're my kind of

1150
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,160
state. They're wondering about poop all

1151
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,079
the time. Love that. South Carolina,

1152
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,960
too. Uh, but they're worried about dark

1153
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,560
green stool. H, wonder what they're

1154
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,920
eating. Looks like California way over

1155
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,920
there. They're wondering about sweaty

1156
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,079
palms. You got to wonder why. But

1157
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,920
nevertheless, all over the country, the

1158
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,119
top three worries that people were

1159
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,119
googling were sleep, digestion, and

1160
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,720
stress. Let's go to one of the states

1161
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,400
that had a question about stress. We're

1162
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,640
going to make a Zoom house call to the

1163
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,000
state of Virginia and see what the

1164
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,000
question is. According to our

1165
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,680
state-by-state Gallup poll data from our

1166
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,359
partners at ShareCare, Virginia was

1167
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,760
actually the 13th best in handling

1168
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,359
stress. So, Amber joins us from a state

1169
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,599
that knows how to manage stress. What's

1170
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:43,040
your question, Amber?

1171
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,839
Hey, Dr. Oz. Everyone in Virginia really

1172
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,440
wants to know, does stress cause the

1173
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,160
runs?

1174
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,079
Does stress cause the runs? Huh? Yes.

1175
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,400
Well, it turns out that it can be an

1176
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,599
unfortunate side effect of stress. You

1177
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,200
know, stress triggers release of

1178
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,200
hormones that signaling your body to go

1179
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,880
into fight or flight mode. And

1180
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,880
unfortunately, side effect of this is

1181
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,000
motility in your large intestine because

1182
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,200
you don't want to carry all that stuff

1183
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,040
around if you're running away from

1184
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,440
something that's chasing you, right? So,

1185
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,200
it does tend to increase that motility.

1186
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,640
So, when the colon moves, it gets you to

1187
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,760
have diarrhea at times. But, I'll give

1188
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,280
you a little tip to help you from

1189
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,040
repeatedly running to the bathroom when

1190
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,079
you feel stressed out. Whether you're in

1191
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,079
Virginia or anywhere else in the

1192
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,440
country, avoid caffeine. That's a

1193
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,960
cathartic. It'll move it along.

1194
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,480
Carbonated drinks will have that effect.

1195
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,839
and actually dairy for some people

1196
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,079
because they make your stomach feel

1197
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,520
worse. So listen, it's a great question.

1198
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,680
I love the fact that Virginia pays

1199
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,880
attention to to stress and ask questions

1200
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,720
about it. I want you everyone in the

1201
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,119
country to see how their state ranks in

1202
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,720
health at sharecare.com. Go there, see

1203
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,920
where you rank. You might learn

1204
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,359
something. Together, change is

1205
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,720
happening. Everybody, our journey is

1206
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,940
just beginning.

1207
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,940
