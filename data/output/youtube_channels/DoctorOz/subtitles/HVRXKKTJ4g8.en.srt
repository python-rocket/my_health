2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,440
Today on Oz. That's a big issue, folks.

3
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,600
An identity victim shows Dr. Oz how easy

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,120
it is for thieves to steal his medical

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,280
info. Is your password the name of a TV

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,679
show host? Do you actually have that?

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,680
How to outsmart crooks after your cash

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,000
and medical data? The tools you need to

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,480
protect yourself. Plus, sure, it's great

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,840
for popcorn and heating leftovers, but

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,720
wait till you see what else your

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,279
microwave can do. Coming up next on Dr.

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,279
Oz.

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,840
Now, you have seen the headlines.

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,760
Security breaches at banks and major big

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,480
box stores have left all of us feeling

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,040
pretty vulnerable to identity theft. And

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,360
now the FBI is warning your personal

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,040
health records are the latest target.

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,800
That's why today I'm giving you the

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,719
tools you need to protect yourself from

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,000
the identity thieves after your money

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,199
and your medical

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,039
records. It's become a common

25
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,879
headline. Identity theft. Crooks

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,039
stealing personal information for

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,760
financial

28
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,760
gain. And now, medical identity theft is

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,640
being called an epidemic. Already

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,200
affecting over 2.3 million Americans and

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,360
growing. But unlike traditional credit

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,439
card crime, medical identity theft

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,240
victims are rarely informed about

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,320
suspicious or fraudulent activity, which

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,360
could lead to incorrect treatment and

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,680
devastating effects on your health. Yet

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,880
most of us are still unaware of how to

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,479
protect our medical and financial

39
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,200
information or just how easy it is to

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,759
steal. With 90% of healthcare

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,840
organizations admitting to breaches and

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,840
ATMs and cell phones also being

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,479
targeted, no one is safe. CEO John

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,439
Silio's identity was stolen and the

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,680
thief embezzled $300,000 from John's

46
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,240
clients. The crime destroyed his

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,000
company. So John made it his mission to

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,000
help others protect their personal

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,320
information. With your medical and

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,799
financial identity at risk, you may feel

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,040
like a sitting duck, but John says there

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,750
are ways to outsmart the thieves and

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,239
keep your identity

54
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,599
[Music]

55
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,120
safe. John joining us. What is the

56
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,720
biggest misperception you think people

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,400
have about identity theft? You know,

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,400
we've all gotten very familiar with

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,400
regular identity theft, loss of a credit

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
card number, social security number, but

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,760
increasingly thieves are going after our

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
medical data. They want the health

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,760
insurance information. They want the

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,520
doctor's records. Um, it's it's

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
terrible. And that's what I fight back

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
against. This is shocking to me. I

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,000
thought it was all about just us as

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,440
doctors being careful. You as the

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,720
consumers are getting robbed when this

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
happens in a much more important way

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,680
than with credit cards. So, the first

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,959
scam we're going to identify today is

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,440
having to do with health. And I've asked

74
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,640
Nikki Burton to join us. Nikki actually

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,400
went through a crisis of her own and I

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,400
I' I'd love to hear from you and just

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,560
tell us the story of how surprised you

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,239
were and what happened. Okay. Um well,

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,040
what happened to me is that when I was

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,440
17 years old, I tried to donate blood at

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,599
the Red Cross and I was actually unable

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,239
to do so because their records showed

83
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,879
that my person and my information um had

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,800
HIV and was HIV positive. That's pretty

85
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,599
shocking. Yeah, it was. Especially Were

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,319
you HIV positive? No. No. Nope. and not

87
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,640
then. Um, and I was 17, so I was rather

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,360
overwhelmed. But I later learned that a

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,440
man had used my identity and my

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,200
information, my records to obtain

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,800
treatment for HIV, and that was how that

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,280
information had gotten into their

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,599
database. So, I tried to correct it

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,920
right away. Um, but it was actually 6

95
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,080
years before I was successful. It's an

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,680
unbelievable tale. Six years. You you

97
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,239
walked around with a diagnosis of being

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,920
HIV positive and God knows what else so

99
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
far. But yeah, we think it's just that

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,159
it was I was HIV positive. So, how do we

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
outsmart these medical identity thieves?

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,239
So, first of all, you got to share with

103
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,720
care. You've got to um give that

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,720
information only when it's absolutely

105
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,920
necessary and ask your doctor's office,

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,640
do they need your social security

107
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,239
number? If in doubt, give put a dash and

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,840
put the last four characters. You don't

109
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,200
have to give the whole thing. Now,

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,799
women, let me tell you that for a

111
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,480
second. That's a big issue, folks, cuz I

112
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
must even in my own office, I always ask

113
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,439
patients there are social security

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,560
numbers. We have 15 different places we

115
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,159
can get that. I don't even know why we

116
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,360
ask it now that you bring it up. I think

117
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,879
we ought to start there. Why are people

118
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,640
asking for our social security numbers

119
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,560
all the time whenever we sign in in a

120
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,239
hospital? I'm with you. Right.

121
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,759
Absolutely. So, let's But from now on,

122
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,199
let's just do what you just said. Put

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,479
the last four digits in there so we know

124
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,759
that it's you if we have to double

125
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,520
check. Everything else should just be

126
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
dashes. Yeah. You know, if it's

127
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,160
Medicare, you're going to have to give

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,240
it right now. But for all other

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,320
purposes, only give it if you absolutely

130
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,919
have to. Another thing you can do is

131
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,000
monitor those records, those vital

132
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,919
documents that you've got. So looking at

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,759
the explanation of benefits that you get

134
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
in the mail after a procedure to see if

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,680
somebody's, you know, draining your

136
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,680
account, looking at your actual doctor's

137
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,600
records, ask for a copy and see, has

138
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
something changed since you were there

139
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,360
last. Yeah. Monitor your vital signs in

140
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
a whole different way. And you know,

141
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,479
because medical identity theft, uh, it

142
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,479
bleeds, it's contagious. It contains

143
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,479
your financial identity, your social

144
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,080
security number, as it did here. So you

145
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,880
also have to protect that side of it.

146
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,120
You can do that by uh monitoring your

147
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,160
financial identity for free on a website

148
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
called annualcreditreport.com.

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
All right, good information. Thanks for

150
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,440
sharing your story. Of course, come on

151
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
over. I want to talk about the next

152
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,600
problem we have, which is ATM machine

153
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,160
skimming. Uh Carolyn's here and like a

154
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,400
lot of folks, how are you, Carolyn?

155
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,840
Uh so, we're all worried about getting

156
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
ripped off when we go to the ATM

157
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,600
machine. This is something that's been a

158
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,520
long-term concern of yours. Has it ever

159
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,560
happened to you? Um, it hasn't happened

160
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,039
to me, but you know, I can probably see

161
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,320
where it could happen. So, uh, John, if

162
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,440
you don't mind, I'd like you to walk us

163
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,199
through how this skimming happens. The

164
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,120
folks, pay close attention here. This

165
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,280
happening all over the country, and it

166
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,600
is absolutely stunning. So, this is a

167
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,240
typical traditional ATM that you might

168
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,479
see in any type of store. Go ahead and

169
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,039
put your card in, okay, as if you were

170
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,360
banking. And you better pull out all the

171
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,440
cash because if you don't, the thieves

172
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,280
can. You see, without even knowing it,

173
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,880
if you don't know what to look for, this

174
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,720
device here, protruding from the

175
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,240
machine, if you wiggle it a little bit,

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,840
it comes off. Oh my gosh. And it's got a

177
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,479
digital skimmer, this is called

178
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,960
skimming, it skims the data off of your

179
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,880
card without even knowing it. It's

180
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
unbelievable. It looks just like the

181
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,560
machine. So, what happens if someone

182
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,639
once someone skims your card? Yeah, it

183
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
looks like the regular old machine. Then

184
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,400
what? They take the the data off it.

185
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,479
Yeah. So they take the data off of that

186
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,360
and then the thief creates an exact

187
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,199
duplicate of the card that you have and

188
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,039
now they're shopping as you. They're

189
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,479
they're literally cashing it out. So

190
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,120
they're two cards online. Yeah.

191
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,720
Literally. Exactly. Make it a digital

192
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,080
copy and then they go on a shopping

193
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,919
spree. Go on a shopping spree. They cash

194
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,520
it out before you even have time to to

195
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,520
react. This all happens very quickly

196
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,639
generally online. If someone was taking

197
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,960
your cards while you're still at the

198
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,560
machine and buying dresses, outfits,

199
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,759
swim gear, whatever, how long would it

200
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
take for you to figure that out?

201
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,280
Honestly, I probably wouldn't know for

202
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,520
about a month because that's when I

203
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
checked my credit card statements. So, a

204
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,440
whole month would go by. So, how do we

205
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,000
outsmart the skimming scam? Yeah. So, I

206
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,160
mean, if you see something sticking off,

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,319
these were made to be flush, right? If

208
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,479
it's protruding like this, wiggle it,

209
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,960
pull it, see if it comes off. They put

210
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,880
these on with two-sided tape. You can

211
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,880
foil it really easily just by looking at

212
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,319
your ATM machine. Unbelievable, Carolyn.

213
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,039
Thank you very much. Here's a little

214
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,680
momento of your stay with us with you.

215
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,800
All

216
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,280
right, the last scam we're going to talk

217
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,479
about today is called

218
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,000
smishing text scams. It's something that

219
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,599
happens on text phones pretty regularly.

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,960
Now, you say this is done quite

221
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,560
frequently and most of us don't even

222
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,039
know what's happening, right? Yeah. In

223
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,520
fact, uh we've we've done it to you. Did

224
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,000
you get any uh strange Yeah. get a

225
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,919
strange text last night?

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,440
I got a text from someone whose email I

227
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,759
thought recognized, but it was a weird

228
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,199
email. Yes. So, I I I clicked it. It

229
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,919
didn't take me anywhere. What did that

230
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,759
text say? Well, that text was bizarre,

231
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,599
but I did send text. I text my wife. You

232
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,960
sent a text after that? Yeah, I sent my

233
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,039
my wife's traveling, so I sent her a

234
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,680
text. It's uh I I don't remember how

235
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,680
intimate it was. It was something uh I

236
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,240
hope that's not on television. Well, I

237
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,960
think it's about to be. Is this the text

238
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,520
you sent? Miss you. Lots of kisses.

239
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,440
XOXO.

240
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,680
That was the uh that was the first text.

241
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,160
She's been gone for a couple days. So,

242
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
so this software actually recorded that

243
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
text. You're kidding me. As you wrote it

244
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,759
and sent it off to me so that I could

245
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,120
see what you were texting. So on your

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,160
computer, you were monitoring what I was

247
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
doing on my phone. What else could you

248
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,560
able to track? You know, you can uh if

249
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,880
this key logging software, which records

250
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,519
every keystroke you put is on there. I

251
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,120
can see emails, I can see contacts, I

252
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,120
can see photos. If you have a banking

253
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
app, I can see you log in. If you have a

254
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,440
health app, I can see your health

255
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,279
information. So So if I have Do I have a

256
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,959
banking app? This is my phone. So, if I

257
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,640
wanted to use this, could you read what

258
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,160
I was doing? Yeah. So, keep it keep it

259
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,200
close. I'm going to move back here with

260
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,040
the iPad. I want you to log in to your

261
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
bank account right now. Keep it keep it

262
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,839
tight. All right. I'm on the account.

263
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,600
Here's my password. This is now taking a

264
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,880
look. It's sending me what he's writing

265
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,000
on there. I just logged in. All right.

266
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,440
So, let me ask you a question.

267
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,720
Is your password the name of another

268
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,240
daytime TV show host?

269
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,399
It is. You actually have that. And is it

270
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,320
five characters? That's it. That's it.

271
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,959
That's unbelievable.

272
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,560
I've got your password because of that

273
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,839
software that you loaded when you

274
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
downloaded when you clicked on that

275
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,120
malicious link. So, how do I I mean, how

276
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
do I avoid that? How does the average

277
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,480
viewer avoid that happening? Yeah. So,

278
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,560
you can either not click on the links in

279
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,560
text. That's kind of a radical way. or

280
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,240
if you have to click on a link, think of

281
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,240
three things. Number one, do you know

282
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,519
the sender? Do you trust them? Do you

283
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,920
know that they've still got control of

284
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,279
their phone? Number two, is the URL

285
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,120
something you recognize? Is it a

286
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,959
legitimate site that you've checked out?

287
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,720
And most importantly, were you expecting

288
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,200
the link? If you're not expecting a

289
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,360
link, don't do it. It's probably an

290
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,839
advertisement. It's the scam trying to

291
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,839
get you to download your uh the malware

292
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,360
or give away your personal information.

293
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,320
This has been fantastic advice, John.

294
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,240
Thank you so much. You bet. Thank you.

295
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,080
To learn more, you can read John Silio's

296
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,920
new book. It's called Privacy Means

297
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,360
Profit. You'll learn John Silio's dos

298
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,800
and don'ts of creating a safe password

299
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,720
as well. Do this. I'm doing this today

300
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,720
myself on dr.com. We'll be right back.

301
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,079
Next, the study that's rocking the

302
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,240
agricultural world. Could the world's

303
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,320
top weed killer cause cancer? And it's

304
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,320
not just used on farms. It could be in

305
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,399
your garden as well. Top food and

306
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,839
environmental advocates go head-to-head.

307
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,240
Is your family at risk? Next, Juliana

308
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,079
Rancic. How you doing now? Sets the

309
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,160
record straight on the eating disorder

310
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,800
rumors, the stress and scrutiny of her

311
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,160
marriage, her job, and her heartbreaking

312
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,680
baby news. All new Oz. That's coming up

313
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,160
tomorrow. It's the world's most used

314
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,640
weed killer found not just on farms, but

315
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,279
also in your garden. It's called

316
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,720
Roundup. Now, there's breaking news. A

317
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,720
new report from the World Health

318
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,200
Organization, which has also declared

319
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,839
today World Health Day, says Roundup

320
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,640
might cause cancer, and that could be a

321
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,760
gamecher. The study rocked big

322
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,880
agriculture and could have major

323
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,399
implications for home gardeners, too.

324
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,399
The World Health Organization's

325
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,120
International Agency for Research on

326
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,680
Cancer recently gathered together 17

327
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,399
experts from 11 countries to answer this

328
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,640
question. What is the likelihood that

329
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,800
glyphosate, the active ingredient in the

330
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,000
world's most widely used herbicide,

331
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,959
might cause cancer? After analyzing 30

332
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,160
years of research, their alarming

333
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:45,519
conclusion, glyphosate is probably

334
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,760
carcinogenic. With the use of glyphosate

335
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,399
in Roundup soaring over the last 20

336
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,600
years, is it time to ask, are the risks

337
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,440
worth

338
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,200
it? Dr. Alan Green is a pediatrician who

339
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,600
has been studying the use of pesticides

340
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,360
and foods for over 20 years. Scott Faber

341
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
is the vice president of the environment

342
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,399
working group. Scott, 30 years ago, the

343
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,920
EPA, the group that protects us,

344
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,000
determined that Roundup might cause

345
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,360
cancer. And then six years later, they

346
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,240
actually changed their minds and said,

347
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,000
"Well, it's not really a problem." So,

348
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,800
who can we believe? Well, at the end of

349
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,320
the day, the world's cancer experts, the

350
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,560
folks at the World Health Organization,

351
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,800
have concluded that this weed killer,

352
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,320
which has exploded in use as more and

353
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,240
more farmers have used GMO corn and GMO

354
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,200
soybeans, is a probable carcinogen. And

355
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,440
this is the body that every regulator in

356
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,480
every government across the globe relies

357
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,079
on to determine what does cause cancer.

358
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,440
Right? So, my goal is always have an

359
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,440
open and honest conversation. You all

360
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,360
know that. But I couldn't get anyone to

361
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,959
appear on the show who supports

362
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,200
glyphosate. Now, we reached out to the

363
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,720
Grocery Manufacturers of America, Crop

364
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,880
Life America, that's an advocacy group

365
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,480
of fertilizer, and Monsanto, that's the

366
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,000
maker of Roundup. They all declined to

367
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,560
be on the show, but we did get

368
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,959
statements from them. Crop Life America

369
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,720
said the IRC report contradicts

370
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,480
established scientific consensus on

371
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,279
these products and reaches inaccurate

372
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,440
conclusions based on a flawed process.

373
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,440
So, Dr. Green, why does this report have

374
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,920
everyone so up in arms? Well, a couple

375
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,920
of reasons. One is that glyphosate is so

376
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,240
commonly used. It's top weed killer in

377
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,000
the world. Uh the US Geological Survey

378
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,920
says that in farm parts of our country,

379
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,920
it actually shows up in the rainwater,

380
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,680
not just on the farms. And it's not just

381
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,079
used in agriculture. People use it on

382
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,680
parks. People use it in ball fields is

383
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,720
people spray it in their own yard. So,

384
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,360
one is super common. The second thing is

385
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,800
that this isn't just another study. You

386
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,279
know, you you hear one study and then

387
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,360
another study, but this is IRC. This is

388
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,600
the world's leading experts. It's not

389
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,959
the policy makers or regulators are

390
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,639
saying, "What should we do?" It's not

391
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,200
the chemical industry. It's people with

392
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,680
one question. Can this chemical cause

393
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,399
cancer in people and they gave it one of

394
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,240
their highest levels of concern.

395
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,199
So, we also got a note from Monsanto. I

396
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,720
want to share this with you because I

397
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,399
want you to have, you know, be pushed to

398
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,560
answer their questions. They said in

399
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,560
part, "All labeled uses of glyphosate

400
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,839
are safe for human health. Many of the

401
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,519
regulatory bodies and science

402
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,519
organizations have reviewed three

403
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,199
decades of data on glyphosate. Their

404
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,600
overwhelming consensus has been that

405
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,160
glyphosate does not pose a risk to

406
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,519
humans, wildlife, or the environment.

407
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,160
So, defenders of these pesticides argue

408
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,480
that this data is coming from mice, not

409
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,800
humans, and they're making an accusation

410
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,360
that we're raising an alarm too soon.

411
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,839
Yeah, I I think that's just not right.

412
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,680
Now, when people have uh have cancer,

413
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,440
it's really hard to go back and trace

414
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,040
what exposure might have caused that,

415
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,959
when, where, how. It's really hard to

416
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,279
tease out. There's so many factors. But

417
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,800
I released their findings in the one of

418
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,800
the world's leading medical journals,

419
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,240
and they had three strands of evidence.

420
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,760
First, they did have animal studies

421
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,199
where you can control everything, and

422
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,959
the only difference is they got exposed

423
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,120
to this weed killer, and they found

424
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,920
strong evidence that in mammals it can

425
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,760
cause cancer. Um, secondly though, you

426
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,600
can't do that in people.

427
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,480
Thankfully, but what you can do is

428
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,720
expose human cells to the weed killer.

429
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,360
And when that was done, they found DNA

430
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,480
damage and chromosomeal damage. And then

431
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
the third strand of evidence which could

432
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,519
lead to cancer. Which could lead to

433
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,760
cancer. Exactly. And then the third

434
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,839
strand of evidence is they looked at the

435
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,079
people who are routinely exposed to

436
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,240
glyphosate just in the course of their

437
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,079
work and they found and this was done in

438
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,920
three countries including the US and

439
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,600
they found higher rates of a certain

440
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,680
type of cancer in the people who are

441
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
exposed. So, taking all of that

442
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,920
together, all of the evidence together,

443
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,920
they said this is probably a human

444
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,839
carcinogen. Yeah, this is a big debate,

445
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,360
everyone. Folks who make these products

446
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
say, "Well, we need more data before you

447
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,399
can make that statement." I think it's

448
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,760
the opposite. Not enough research

449
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600
doesn't mean it's safe. It means we

450
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,519
actually don't know, and it's sort of

451
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,720
upon us, our obligation to figure it out

452
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,000
before we start releasing it and

453
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,920
exposing kids and the other. So, I'd

454
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,560
like to bring Robin O'Brien in. She's a

455
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,480
mom and a food advocate. You've heard

456
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,079
all these comments. Is it frustrating to

457
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,920
you to hear these responses from the

458
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,600
folks who make these products? You know,

459
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,199
it's really not at all surprising. I was

460
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,560
a financial analyst to cover the food

461
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,079
industry and if you step back for a

462
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,920
minute and think about this big chemical

463
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,279
company, this is one of their most

464
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,639
profitable products. So, of course,

465
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,959
they're going to try to dismiss any

466
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,720
concern around it or refute the science.

467
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,680
But like these two have said, these are

468
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,519
our leading cancer researchers from the

469
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,880
World Health Organization and the

470
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,160
National Cancer Institute. And countries

471
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,519
like the Netherlands have already taken

472
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
this precautionary measure. They've

473
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,440
already banned this product. And here we

474
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,800
are in the United States. And you look

475
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,360
at the rates of cancer here in this

476
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,800
country. One in two men and one in three

477
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
women are expected to get cancer in

478
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,120
their lifetime. The CDC now says that

479
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,920
cancer is the leading cause of death by

480
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,079
disease in children under the age of 15.

481
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,000
It's time to take some proactive

482
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,079
measures to exercise precaution. I mean,

483
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,759
I know as a mom when we're pregnant, we

484
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,759
do everything we can. we take all these

485
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,759
little precautionary measures to give

486
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,440
that information to citizens today here

487
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,199
in the United States so that they can

488
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,040
take personal responsibility for their

489
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,120
health. I think it's absolutely critical

490
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,639
at this point. So the good news for me

491
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,079
is that we reached out to the

492
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,079
Environmental Protection Agency and

493
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,280
here's what they said in part. The EPA

494
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,959
is currently reassessing glyphosate and

495
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,480
if at any time the EPA discovers that

496
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,400
the use of a registered pesticide may

497
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,240
result in unreasonable adverse effects

498
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,919
on people or the environment, we will

499
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,679
take action to remove it from the

500
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,679
marketplace or limit its use. I mean,

501
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,799
Scott, this sounds huge. The EPA is

502
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,880
actually re-evaluating again this widely

503
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,319
used product and and of course EPA

504
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,000
should take another look at it, but

505
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,200
let's not forget EPA got this wrong. For

506
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,880
20 years, we've been told that this

507
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,120
herbicide is a better alternative than

508
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,440
other herbicides. We've sprayed more

509
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,440
than 200 million pounds of it every year

510
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,919
on hundreds of millions of acres of crop

511
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,480
land and around our homes and schools.

512
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,320
And it turns out that the experts, the

513
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,160
world's leading cancer cancer experts

514
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,240
now have found that this is probably a

515
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,400
human carcinogen. So that doesn't mean

516
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,679
EPA won't get it right next time. But

517
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
what it does mean is that we ought to

518
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,000
show a little humility, use a little

519
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,400
precaution, and at least let people know

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,640
whether their food is being grown with

521
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,000
these incredibly dangerous herbicides.

522
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,679
Robin, what do you want to see done as a

523
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,360
mom?

524
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,960
No one wants to be told what to eat.

525
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,320
Nobody wants to be told how to feed

526
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,080
their kids. It's hard enough as a mom

527
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,400
just trying to get your kids fed, but

528
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,480
nobody wants cancer either. And I think

529
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
about how our grandmothers when they

530
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
were confronted with the tobacco

531
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,600
industry claiming that their products

532
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,840
were safe, they asked for a label. They

533
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,520
asked for a warning label and today the

534
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,280
majority of our food supply is now

535
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,679
genetically engineered to be Roundup

536
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,200
ready to be tolerant of this very weed

537
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,440
killer that the World Health

538
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,919
Organization is saying it might cause

539
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,240
cancer. And I think if you can give that

540
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,880
information to parents, if you can give

541
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,200
that information to our country to try

542
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,840
to head off the escalating rates of of

543
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,240
this disease, that's just a smart

544
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,799
precautionary measure. Thank you,

545
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,360
Robert. We we all know what the health's

546
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,280
risks are and we need Washington DC to

547
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,880
listen. That's why in September, if you

548
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,039
remember, I asked you to sign the take

549
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,559
action petition to urge the president to

550
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,640
stop the approval of a more powerful

551
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,400
pesticide made with glyphosate. And you

552
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,240
answered the call. We received over a

553
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
100,000 signatures. That's what the

554
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,240
White House got. It is time for change

555
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,840
and it's your right to demand safer food

556
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,120
and environmental safety. You can find

557
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,320
all the statements mentioned here on the

558
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,559
Dr. Raj show on our website.com. We'll

559
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,559
be right back.

560
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Next, the housewives of New York are

561
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,520
getting real. From their fights to their

562
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,400
figures, they're all about to face the

563
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,919
truth. Good regular sex is one of the

564
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,320
best beauty products you can have for

565
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,000
your skin. Is it true? Answering your

566

most. Whoever said a doctor's visit

568
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,600
isn't fun has obviously never been to

569
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,640

[Music]

574
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:03,360
tickets. Betrayal, crumbling marriages,

575
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,960
new loves, and plenty of wild nights.

576
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,280
That's a typical week for the Real

577
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,840
Housewives of New York. But no matter

578
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,160

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,440
questions. So, welcome out Carol

Kristen and Dinda, the newest member.

585
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,440
You guys look great. How are you? Nice

586
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,600
to meet you. Oh my goodness. They all

587
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,200
look fantastic. I'll get I'm going to

588
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,360
get in trouble. So many kisses.

589
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,640
I'm so happy you're here. Thank you for

590
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,919
being here. So, we're going to try do

591
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,480
something completely different. Just to

592
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,120
start us off, you've all agreed to face

593
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,120
the truth. So, they've agreed to

594
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,799
honestly answer all of the viewers

595
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,520
questions. I have the ones that are most

596
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,520
commonly asked from at least my team, my

597
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,919
viewers. You ready? Ready. Honestly, you

598
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,080
all pledged to be honest. Why not? Why

599
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,960
not? Exactly. So, you lead the way. All

600
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,080
right. Here goes. Who cares most about

601
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,840
how they look? Which of the housewives

602
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,320
cares most about how they look? We have

603
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,919
a Kristen there. Kristen. Oh my

604
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,159
goodness.

605
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,240
Kristen, is that true? I think I think

606
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,520
it might be. Why would they all accuse

607
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,960
you of caring so much about how you

608
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,200
look? I don't know. I think you should

609
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,600
ask somebody else. She She's a model.

610
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,600
So, she grew she grew up with the

611
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,960
territory everywhere we go. I do like I

612
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,200
like my hair and makeup and I like my

613
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,320
clothes and she's so pretty. So, oh,

614
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,320
they're being kind now. We'll see how

615
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,919
this might get a little cattier as we go

616
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,320
along. How about this question? Who's

617
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,640
most obsessed with their weight? Oh,

618
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,600
this is goodness. We have an obvious

619
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,400
choice here.

620
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, we have splits. A split here.

621
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,799
Maybe Dinda, you have to pick somebody.

622
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,280
Dinda choosing because we just had this.

623
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,440
Dinda. Darinda. Dinda. I should be

624
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,440
obsessed with my weight. Okay, let me

625
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,880
So, Dinda, why is it that they think

626
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,240
you're most obsessed about your weight?

627
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, they think I'm obsessed about my

628
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,280
weight. I change it cuz Carol's always

629
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,360
because she just brought it up to me in

630
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,559
the dressing. I'm obsessed with

631
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,480
Carol's weight right now. I think that's

632
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,360
all I talk about. I changed it. I I'm

633
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,200
obsessed with Carol with that actually

634
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,039
projecting because it doesn't love her

635
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,640
body. She's so She has such a great ass

636
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,039
and she's thin and beautiful and I love

637
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,400
her. That was She's natural. I'm I'm

638
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,080
obsessed with my weight. I'm obsessed

639
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,360
with your weight, too. Okay. So, you're

640
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,799
off the hook. You're being very honest.

641
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,320
I appreciate it. Now, ask away. I

642
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,919
promised I'd answer your questions. Take

643
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,520
it away. You go in any order you want.

644
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,679
You want to start, Carol? Okay. These

645
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,159
are our health questions. Okay. I'm a

646
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,720
believer that

647
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,240
um good regular sex is one of the best

648
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,360
beauty products you can have for your

649
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,480
skin. Now, is that a wives tale or is it

650
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,799
true? Does it affects your is it a good

651
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,159
anti-aging? I think it's very good for

652
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,600
and I'm not I'm not advocating

653
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,760
promiscuity. That's why she looks so

654
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,880
great. No, consensual consensual

655
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,240
monogous sex the right thing to do. I

656
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,120
tell a couple things to do. First of

657
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,280
all, on average, on average, the

658
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,440
interaction is about 6 minutes long. We

659
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,520
burn about 21 calories. That's all.

660
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,400
That's all. So there's not much action.

661
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,840
What are you having sex with?

662
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,120
I'm not asking about me. I'm just saying

663
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,039
that's what the numbers are across the

664
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,559
country. Is that very dissimilar from

665
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,559
what your experiences generally? Very

666
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,559
dissimilar.

667
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,600
But it releases hormones,

668
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,200
right? It's not because it burns

669
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,559
calories. It distresses you. the

670
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,159
hormones you release actually are the

671
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,159
ones that rejuvenate you, makes you feel

672
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,919
better. But in addition, if you look at

673
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,559
makeup, what makeup primarily does is

674
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,080
make you look attractive in a sexual

675
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,280
way, right? The the red rouge, the

676
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,640
blushing of the cheeks, which happens

677
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,240
when you get excited. The the lipstick

678
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,760
makes your lips more red. Much of

679
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,600
cosmetics is about making us look

680
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,919
sexually excited, not just attractive,

681
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,840
excited, right? So, it mimics youth.

682
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,440
That's what the makeup does. So, it's

683
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,760
good to spend more time in that space in

684
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,520
your life. Okay. Thinda, the newest

685
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,919
member of the group. Yes. I have a

686
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,039
question talking about weight. How do

687
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,280
you stay thin or get thin without diet

688
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:09,559
and exercising all the time? What's the

689
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,919
magic the magic thing? I am not the

690
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,840
sex diet and exercise. Isn't all these

691
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,600
magic diets? Tell me one of them works.

692
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,440
Some magic diet. No, there is no magic

693
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,880
diet. And you don't want a magic diet

694
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,880
because what you want is a lifestyle

695
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,400
that let you be what you want to be. The

696
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,080
best way to do that is to focus on the

697
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,679
calories you take in, which is by eating

698
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,880
foods that have rich nutrients. Because

699
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,320
your brain's not measuring calories,

700
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,679
it's measuring nutrients. You give it

701
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,679
food with nutrients in it, it'll stop

702
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,799
you in time. Don't think exercise will

703
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,320
get you there. That's a big mistake

704
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,520
women make all the time. But the way you

705
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,760
lose weight is by eating rich

706
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,279
nutrientdense foods, then actually your

707
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,880
body will naturally stop you when it's

708
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,640
happy. And so, we talk about that in the

709
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,400
show all the time. And we find many

710
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,159
things work, but for different people at

711
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,840
different times. So, the seventh

712
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,880
season's coming up. I have no idea why

713
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,799
you guys sign up for this stuff because

714
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,320
it's brutal in there. Right? So, I want

715
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,120
you all to watch The Real Housewives of

716
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,000
New York in action. This promises to be

717
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,679
very dramatic.

718
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,279
Why? Why? Why do you sign up for this? I

719
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,760
mean, it looks incredibly stressful to

720
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,360
me. Oh my gosh. You know, we really do.

721
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,559
For the money, for the money, we love

722
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
each other. I have everything. No, we

723
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,840
had a lot of fun. I mean, you know,

724
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,600
there's a lot of stress, sure, added to

725
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
the situation, but we had really a lot

726
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,360
of fun shooting this season. I I

727
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,520
personally had the best We argue our way

728
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,440
to solution every time. Yeah, we really

729
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,320
do. Family. Okay, a little surprise for

730
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,760
you. I've been thinking about this

731
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,520
segment for a while. And each season,

732
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,760
you guys have those new taglines. So

733
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,440
coolly done, nice, beautifully, elegant.

734
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,360
It's the iconic opening of every show.

735
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,679
So, I wanted in on the fun. So, I took

736
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,080
the liberty yesterday of crafting a few

737
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,279
of my own possible taglines, but we

738
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,480
couldn't decide which one was the best

739
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,559
one. So, I'm going to let you and our

740
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,799
audience decide which ones you like the

741
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,240
most. Are you willing to help? Okay.

742
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,080
Don't be too catty about these. Take a

743
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,279
look.

744
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,720
The big apple in keeping this doctor

745
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:54,640
away. The doctor will see you

746
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,840
now. When I bring healthy back, I do it

747
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:01,039
in style. I can handle drama, but I

748
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,320
can't deal with drama.

749
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,799
So, what's your favorite?

750
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,039
I like the third one. The third one. You

751
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,960
do it in style. Do it live. You do it in

752
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,559
style. We'll all do our tags. You want

753
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,480
to do it together? Yeah. Do yours again.

754
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,600
Oh, tag lines from the show. Yeah. You

755
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,360
guys get up right now. Everyone get up

756
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,799
right now. Your tag lines for this

757
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,600
season. Oh my god. All right. And I'll

758
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:23,440
do mine at the end. Okay. Are you ready?

759
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,200
Okay.

760
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,240
You're going to go first. Really? Yes.

761
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,480
All right. Okay. Turn.

762
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,480
Yes. I give up town a whole new

763
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,480
attitude.

764
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,440
Pretty is smarter than you may

765
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:43,840
think. Everyone tells me to do just one

766
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,440
thing. I am. I'm doing Sonia.

767
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,760
Okay, I'm going to do mine from last

768
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,760
year. The Big Apple has never tasted so

769
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,760
sweet.

770
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,039
Um, if you're going to gossip about me

771
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,360
behind my back, at least check out my

772
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,840
great ass.

773
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,520
How do I That was ranked number one of

774
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,159
all the T. That's a good one. I noticed

775
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,159
you all turn your backs.

776
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,039
That's how you get that turn going. You

777
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,000
know, when I bring healthy back, I do it

778
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,919
in style.

tomorrow. Your microwave. You know it's

805
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,240
great for making popcorn. Fantastic for

806
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,000
heating over leftovers. But today, Dr.

807
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,320
Oz viewers are stepping inside our

808
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,240
microwave laboratory right here to show

809
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,559
us the things you didn't know you could

810
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,080
do with a microwave. First up is Nikia.

811
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,559
What do you do with Nikia? How are you?

812
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,760
Hi, Dr. Eyes. How are you? What do you

813
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,120
like? What do you want to show us in our

814
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,480
microwave lab? Okay. Well, you know

815
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,320
what? This is a trick I learned from my

816
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,559
husband. Um your husband? From my

817
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,039
husband. Uh what I use it for is to

818
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,960
clean certain things in the kitchen. One

819
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,399
being the cutting board. He taught me on

820
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,000
the rag that he would like clean the

821
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,279
dishes with. And I was like, "You know

822
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,720
what? If you could do it with a rag and

823
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,960
a sponge, I'm going to use a cutting

824
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,320
board." And it absolutely works. Show us

825
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,600
how you do it. I can't I'm going to show

826
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,200
you. You actually trained him to wash

827
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,799
the dishes. Is that right? Not only did

828
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,360
I train him to wash the dishes, I

829
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,240
trained him to cook, pick up the kids.

830
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,559
Yes. Where is he here? No, he's busy

831
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,399
with the kids. I bet he's actually um

832
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,840
he's on the shoot. So Oh, wow. I'm very

833
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,039
proud of him. Okay, so let me show you

834
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,360
how to do this. You see it's a little

835
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,360
dirty. You put the Oh, wait. Hold up. We

836
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,480
got to open this. I use the dish soap

837
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,760
like this. I wet the sponge. You don't

838
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,640
put the soap in the water. You put the

839
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,279
soap right on. You don't want to do

840
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:32,159
that. I just put the soap right on. Kind

841
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,760
of want to go like this. Right. Just dab

842
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,679
it a little bit. And then what I'm going

843
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,600
to do is pop it in the microwave. Oh,

844
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,120
you don't have to actually scrub it. No,

845
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,399
no. This kills the germs, too. You put

846
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,760
it in the microwave

847
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:45,919
60 seconds. You know, I am a mother of

848
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,360
four, so I need things that are quick

849
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,720
and convenient. But, you know, if you

850
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,039
consider my husband, I'm a mother of

851
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,120
five. So, you just And then you hit

852
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,080
start. That's it. That's it. And when it

853
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,360
when you get it out, you have to scrub

854
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,640
it down a little bit. You don't. You

855
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,559
don't. It's actually clean. It

856
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,240
disinfected. You use it for a sponge.

857
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,640
You use it for a rag. Please don't use

858
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,080
any metal materials because I can't be

859
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,200
responsible if you blow something up. Of

860
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,039
course not. Your husband would tell me

861
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,399
that. Thank you very much. I appreciate

862
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,840
it. All right, let's see what else is in

863
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,520
the microwave. So, we've got our

864
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,159
something here that's pretty cool. It's

865
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,760
a cake in a mug. Looks pretty cool like

866
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,840
that. So, I want you to understand how

867
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,200
to make this. Gemma, she actually made

868
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,279
this in less than a minute. Take a look.

869
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,880
Hi, Dr. Oz. I know you can do a lot of

870
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,080
amazing things in a microwave, but did

871
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,159
you know you can make a cake in a

872
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,520
microwave? Let me show you how. In a

873
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,120
microwavable mug, you're going to mash

874
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,640
up your ripe banana. Next, we're going

875
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,399
to add in our peanut butter and mix it

876
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,399
well. Next, mix in your little bit of

877
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,320
sugar. Then, crack in your egg and mix

878
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,080
well. Keep on mixing until you see the

879
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,000
egg combined with the peanut butter. And

880
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,520
then, lastly, add in your cocoa powder.

881
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,200
Our chocolate mug cake is ready for the

882
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,120
microwave. Our chocolate mug cake is

883
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,640
done and it smells gorgeous. This

884
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,720
chocolate cake is full of protein,

885
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,919
gluten-free, and it tastes great. So,

886
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,520
one of the great things about these mug

887
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,440
cakes is that they're portion controlled

888
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,880
for those times where you just need some

889
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,039
cake.

890
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,399
All right, Constus is here. He says,

891
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,840
"Our microwave can make up for all your

892
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:07,840
mistakes." How is that, Constus? How

893
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,080
does it protect us from our errors? All

894
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,399
right, so the microwave is my best

895
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,080
friend. I am a very busy person. I'm out

896
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,880
the house by 4:00 in the morning and not

897
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,440
home until probably like 8 or 9. I need

898
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,200
my beans. I'm a vegetarian, so I eat a

899
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,600
lot of beans and rice. I don't have time

900
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,039
to soak beans for 24 hours. And if I

901
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,799
did, I probably forgot about them. I

902
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,200
would, too. So, here is a life hack.

903
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,880
You're going to take three cups of water

904
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,320
per one cup of beans. All right. So,

905
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,600
roughly this much. Yeah, roughly that

906
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,279
much. You're going to pour it in

907
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,480
here. All right. So, we have it poured

908
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,240
in. And what you're going to do, you're

909
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,840
going to take it take this and we're

910
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,559
going to put it in the microwave for 15

911
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,559
minutes. After the 15 minutes, you're

912
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,320
going to let it soak for an hour so that

913
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,960
the water will absorb into the beans and

914
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,200
make it really soft. All right. So, 15

915
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,399
minutes. 15 minutes. And then 1 hour of

916
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,919
just letting it cool off and everything.

917
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,880
That's the same. And then you can make

918
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,480
whatever you want to make out of it. You

919
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,840
make whatever it really really soft.

920
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,279
Yeah. I got It seems too good to be

921
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,880
true, but you're absolutely right. I'm

922
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,640
telling it works. I do it all the time.

923
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,240
So why would anybody soak their beans

924
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
from now on? I don't understand. Like

925
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,240
this is 2015. It's time to move on.

926
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,480
We're done with soaking beans. All

927
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,000
right. Very nicely done. Thank you so

928
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,120

What's your favorite microwave hack?

934
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,840
With a young child, we're always looking

935
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,679
for ways to save money. When our sponges

936
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,519
get a little old, I moisten them and put

937
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,720
it in the microwave for a minute. Perks

labels really mean? Are these new

944
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,760
enhanced milks really worth your milk

weather, milk's at the top of everyone's

grocery list. But let's face it, the

962
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,080
milk aisle is getting confusing. From

963
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,760
whole to skim to new designer milks.

981
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,119
Hey, Monica. So, she's going to simplify

982
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,639
it for us. make it easy for people like

983
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,240
me and you who don't get this stuff

984
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,679
sometimes. So, look over to the side

985
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,720
there. You see the skim milk? This is

986
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,320
We're going to talk about the skinny on

987
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,079
skim milk here. Which of these do you

988
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,599
normally buy from that top shelf? I

989
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,280
actually go for the skim milk. This one

990
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,240
right here. Well, that's enhanced skim

991
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,679
milk. Is that what you drink or you

992
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,200
drink the regular? I drink the regular

993
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,200
skim milk. There's nothing better than

994
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,159
an ice cold glass of skim milk with a

995
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,359
box of chocolate chip cookies.

996
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,040
You had me. I can cook. Am I right? All

997
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,560
right. Help us. What does the label

998
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,040
mean? First, what does enhanced mean

999
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,480
versus regular skim milk? Okay, so I'm

1000
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,919
sure Is this the first one that's gone

1001
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,200
on the shelf during a snowstorm? This is

1002
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:54,800
the last one. This is the I I got

1003
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,160
knocked over lady with a walker for this

1004
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,800
one. So, they enhance this is skim milk.

1005
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,480
I'll model it. So, non-fat milk, but

1006
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,200
it's got extra protein and extra

1007
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,440
calcium. And they do that by adding

1008
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,119
dried milk powder to it, just like the

1009
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,680
instant milk that you might have in your

1010
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,920
cupboard at home. So, this is regular

1011
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,359
cupboard. Is this the enhanced stuff?

1012
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,280
This is the enhanced over here.

1013
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,119
Does it taste different? It's much

1014
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,040
fuller. Yes, that's right. It tastes a

1015
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,560
little bit less watery than skim milk.

1016
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,160
Are these becoming pretty popular? The

1017
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,760
enhanced ones, they've been around for a

1018
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,200
long time and people do because it

1019
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,520
tastes a little bit less watery than the

1020
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,200
skim milk, but it's still non-fat and

1021
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,640
people like the extra protein. So, this

1022
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,240
is I agree with her. She's a

1023
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,079
nutritionist. I think she knows. Stick

1024
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,320
with me. Drag him over here while you

1025
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,920
come. All right, next drinking area. No,

1026
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,240
leave that. Leave that. We got more

1027
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,680
shopping to do. So, about whole milk.

1028
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,680
One of the biggest misconceptions is

1029
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,359
whole milk. You say it's misunderstood

1030
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,880
for a bunch of reasons. Well, actually,

1031
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,160
yeah, I'd love to clear this up. You

1032
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,079
know, people are afraid of whole milk

1033
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,560
because they think it's high in fat,

1034
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,320
right? All right. So, compare whole 2%

1035
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,160
and skim, right? So, whole milk doesn't

1036
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,200
have any of the fat taken out of it, but

1037
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,720
it's still almost 97% fat-ree. And

1038
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,000
that's what people don't understand. So,

1039
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,520
here's here's what we have to kind of

1040
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,800
explain this. And this this is right out

1041
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,240
of my book. I tried to break this down

1042
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,560
because people are really confused about

1043
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,160
this. So in one whole container, one

1044
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,240
whole quart of whole milk, you have just

1045
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,320
six teaspoons of butter fat. That's what

1046
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,720
that represents. But in 2% milk, the

1047
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,480
reduced fat, four teaspoons. So it's,

1048
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,320
you know, it's a little bit more than

1049
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,320
half. Different, right? It's about 2/3.

1050
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,400
And then down here in skim milk, just a

1051
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,560
smidge. Yeah. But as Dr. Oz said

1052
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,720
earlier, the more fat you take out, the

1053
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,400
more milk sugar you're left with. So

1054
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,920
everyone, my announcement today, I think

1055
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,440
we should go to whole milk. I think

1056
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,800
we're paying a price in taste and not

1057
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,400
getting a benefit. And studies have

1058
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,320
shown you're actually better off with

1059
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,440
the whole milk. So that's not adultery.

1060
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,880
Yeah, it's not a big difference in

1061
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,359
calories. This is New York City. We got

1062

1063
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:52,560
Talking about it. Yeah. Go ahead. Now we

1064
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,400
got All right, let's finish up with a

1065
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,440

1067
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,359
designer milk. Designer milk. What the

1068
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,520
hell is designer milk? What is Gucci

1069
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,359
going to make milk next? Yeah. You want

1070
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,680
to lose weight? Take a few sips and

1071
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,200
forget about the weight. You'll lose so

1072
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,640
much weight, you'll disappear to put

1073
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,000
your picture on the back of the milk

1074
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,079
carton with a perfectly manicured milk

1075
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,839
mustache. Milk from Gucci.

1076
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,839
Well, you know, it's not far off. What

1077
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,079
you just picked up there, that is called

1078
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,240
Fair Life. Coca-Cola makes that. That's

1079
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,680
right. Please explain to me to Why are

1080
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,200
people making designer milks? Why would

1081
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,480
the consumers want to try it? Well, this

1082
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,720
is brand new and I'm getting a lot of

1083
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,560
questions about this. So they start with

1084
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,119
fresh milk and then they use a special

1085
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,480
filtration process and they dial down

1086
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,160
some of the nutrients that we might want

1087
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,599
to limit like the milk sugars and then

1088
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,920
they dial up some of the things that we

1089
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,079
might want more of like protein and

1090
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,400
calcium. So that's the deal with the

1091
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:49,560
with the design. That's that's not these

1092
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,560
are both.

1093
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,680
You sure you can afford that? I tell you

1094
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,960
I think this is really good. Oh, how

1095
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,480
long has this been in here? This isn't

1096
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,560
milk. This is cottage cheese. This is

1097
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,400
this is

1098
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:03,119
f are you concerned that a soft drink

1099
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,040
company is making milk? Yeah, this is

1100
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,560
raising a lot of eyebrows. I think you

1101
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,920
know it's probably a lot better for us

1102
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,520
than a lot of what they've been selling

1103
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,119
us for the last years. On the other

1104
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,960
hand, you know, all that processing

1105
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,800
costs something. So, you are going to be

1106
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,800
paying more. It's designer milk in more

1107
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,320
ways than one. And some might argue

1108
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,240
maybe milk is a food that doesn't really

1109
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,640
need to be improved. Yeah. I got to say

1110
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,079
I'd rather companies make products that

1111
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,359
are good for us. And I want to applaud

1112
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,280
people for trying to do that. All right.

1113
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,280
You can catch Vic. I got a one question.

1114
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,200
Is this chocolate milk? Oh my goodness.

1115
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,320
Give me that. You can't afford that. You

1116
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,680
know why I can't afford it? He's

1117
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,040
starting with That's true. My wife told

1118
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,920
me chocolate milk doesn't come from

1119
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,599
brown cows. Is that true?

1120
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,680
You know, he's starring with Kevin James

1121
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,320
now when he says that kind of mall cop.

1122
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,160
A mall cop part two. Fixing the movie,

1123
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,680
right? April 17th it comes out. Do you

1124
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,440
survive? Yes. I'm in a whole movie. I

1125
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,880
play Gino Chisetti, a mall cop from

1126
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,200
Staten Island who drinks his milk. Yeah.

1127
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,760
All right. You can also catch him on an

1128
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,280
exclusive oz video.com. We'll be right

1129
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,920
back. Thank you. Thank you. I got to get

1130
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,560
the bread and milk. I got to get the

1131
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,599
bread of milk. I got to get the bread.

Juliana Rancic. How you doing now? Sets

1134
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,480
the record straight on the eating

1135
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,280
disorder rumors, the stress and scrutiny

1136
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,320
of her health, her marriage, her job,

1137
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,200
and her heartbreaking baby news. Plus,

1138
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,119
watch for dinner. Healthy one pot

1139
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,119
wonders that are cheap. That's my kind

1140
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,280
of meal. And we'll feed the whole

1141
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,570
family. I'm putting my bib on now. All

[Music]

1144
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,880
tomorrow. Now, it's time for, in case

1145
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,119
you missed it. First, we had some real

1146
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,880
fun today with the Real Housewives of

1147
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,240
New York. They dropped by. And I'm not

1148
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,000
sure what Lisa will think of this, but

1149
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,400
my staff came up with a few possible

1150
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,760
taglines if I were a housewife. Take a

1151
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,680
look. The big apple wasn't keeping this

1152
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,040
doctor

1153
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:02,960
away. The doctor will see you

1154
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:06,160
now. When I bring healthy back, I do it

1155
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,040
in style. I can handle trauma, but I

1156
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,040
can't deal with

1157
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,520
drama. So, do you all have a favorite?

1158
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,640
You can let me know by voting on dr.com.

1159
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,960
Let me know which one you think I should

1160
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,040
be using next year. And before we go,

1161
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,800
today is World Health Day, a day for all

1162
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,400
of us to bring important health issues

1163
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,720
into the spotlight. And I want to take

1164
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,720
an opportunity to highlight three topics

1165
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,800
that were not being discussed six years

1166
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,560
ago when we started this show. So, I'm

1167
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,160
going to share a special video on my

1168
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,520
Facebook page that highlights these

1169
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,760
issues. I feel strongly they ought to be

1170
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,680
on your radar. So, take a look and share

1171
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,240
it on your own Facebook wall to keep the

1172
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,240
conversation going.
