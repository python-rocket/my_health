00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,440
Honestly, I don't know. Alec Bowwin and

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,759
his beautiful wife are doing it. They've

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,760
got four kids, ranging from 5 months to

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,080
5 years old. It's a lot to handle,

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,960
right? It'll keep you going. But perhaps

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,160
Alex's biggest dad challenge. Well, it's

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,359
not how to keep his cool when his

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,279
22-year-old model Ireland sends out an

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,000
Instagram post like

11
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,920
this. And it goes viral. About to tell

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,439
us how he responded to Ireland's post.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,640
Plus, he's going to tell us about the

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,399
personal health struggle his family

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,730
recently helped him through. Alec Bowen,

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,180
my friend, come on out

17
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,180
[Applause]

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,800
[Applause]

19
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,640
here like an

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,200
airport, right? Can I go over here? Go

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,280
this

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,760
side. You know,

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,440
oh, they love you. I always say when I

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920
come here, I say, "This studio of yours

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,840
is like an airport terminal.

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,199
We need to have like a duty-free shop

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,960
over here and a Starbucks over here. The

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,080
biggest stage in Manhattan." It is a big

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
stage. They used to Now, I want to ask

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,760
you a quick question, please. Didn't all

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,960
your daughters post pictures of

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,119
themselves like half naked on a

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,520
motorcycle? Oh my goodness. Come on. I

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,720
had this. Well, this I've had adult

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,720
daughter issues, which we'll talk about

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,159
as well. But before that, how did you

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,600
react and how did you feel because

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,960
they're different when you saw that

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,840
picture? I think that the um you know,

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,680
Ireland is a model and she does a lot of

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,920
fitness modeling, so swimwear and

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
athletic wear. So, in that world, I

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,280
guess it's like anything goes these

44
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,759
days. So, as a as a father of three

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
grown children, I struggle as well. And

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,920
you we we want to protect our daughters,

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,560
but at the same time, they're they're

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,399
going to grow up. and Ireland now is a

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,920
model, but she's a public person and

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,280
she's out on her own making a name for

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,720
herself. So, how do you deal with that?

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,479
What's it like for you? Well, I don't

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,040
know what it was like for you, but I

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,320
mean, in this day and age where the you

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,000
know, me too, times up, sexual assault,

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,560
all these issues that have become uh

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,920
very uh front and center now. And so as

58
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,280
a father with with girls, uh I'm

59
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,680
grateful that both daughters I have from

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,160
two different marriages have very

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
capable mothers. Yeah. Cuz the mother is

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,400
the one who's going to teach the girl, I

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,920
think, how to get around in the world.

64
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
It's hard for us to break through. Well,

65
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,680
let's talk about congratulations are in

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,360
order. You know, since the last time

67
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
only a year ago you were here, your

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,360
five-month-old Romeo is with us.

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,680
Congratulations. A fourth child. Cute

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
little thing, right? fourth child, but

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
they're all under five, which keeps you

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,720
going. What's it like? What's it like

73
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,239
when you go home now? Um, we uh uh I

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,480
literally have a moment now. I walk in

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,000
the door and I I I literally I I'm not

76
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,120
kidding. I take a pause and I'm like,

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,959
"How did this

78
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,000
happen? What happened here? I was

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,599
single. I was divorced. I had one kid.

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm in a I remember being in a

81
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,599
restaurant. I remember she was very

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,879
beautiful. I remember we talked and I

83
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,599
thought she was very interesting and

84
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,319
very colorful and smart and then boom, I

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,840
got four kids like Jiffy Pop. It was

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,440
like boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,280
boom boom and we have four kids and it's

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,000
um but I I must say that uh I'm at a

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,640
time in my life I'm 60 and I I'm at a

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,319
time in my life when work is just in a

91
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,800
different place. Yeah. I mean, I love

92
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,200
working and I the things I do I enjoy,

93
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,319
but I certainly was ready to have

94
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,319
something else that was more uh powerful

95
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,640
and more meaningful to put my energy

96
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,720
into. But since you're a father now,

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,680
what's it like? Well, I mean, I think

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,239
that it it's my wife works and she

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,080
enjoys working, but she also has

100
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,319
accepted as a lot of women do, it's a

101
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,040
very difficult thing for women. My wife

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,239
could go out the door and be uh your

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,319
daughter is uh uh you know in

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,640
broadcasting and she's a famous uh you

105
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,200
know uh host of a show and your daughter

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,400
is this absolutely gorgeous woman who

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,920
I'm madly in love with Daphne and uh

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,680
she's just I love her. She's this

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,680
fabulous woman. Although Lori and Daphne

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,120
have a podcast by the way. Yes. Which I

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,959
know takes time. They're very they're

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,959
both perfectionists at this. So it does

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,280
put some more pressure on you. And I'm

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,600
wondering cuz I've always thought of you

115
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,440
as sort of being hands-on. You You Not

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,040
anymore.

117
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,199
Well, how's that how's that different

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,400
now taking care of the kids as when you

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,400
were taking care of Ireland when she was

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600
a child? Well, I think it's much more

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,080
complicated when you're in a house where

122
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,440
we had kids so quickly. You know, we had

123
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,639
four kids in four and a half years. So,

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,560
we're you walk in my kitchen and a

125
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,720
five-year-old child is the oldest child

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,240
in the room. You know, you to put that

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,759
in perspective, there's four little

128
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,080
kids. They're all little with their

129
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,080
needs and everything. So, they're kids,

130
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,080
so they're going to do what they do. But

131
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
my wife, what I love about her is she's

132
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,840
always maintaining an energy in the

133
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,360
house of them apologizing to each other,

134
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,320
saying please and thank you to each

135
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,000
other, not just the exchange between

136
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,759
adults, but that the relationship

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,240
between the children is a healthy one.

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
So, love that. I hear that Hillary might

139
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,479
want to have another baby. I'm just

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,320
curious. Who told you that? I've I've

141
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,840
got my

142
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,199
my Are you ready for another baby? Well,

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,120
my wife said, "I want to have another

144
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,639
baby. We want to have another girl." And

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,479
I said, "I hope you and your next

146
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,600
husband are very happy together

147
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,199
and we can all be friends. Maybe we go

148
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,880
all live in a compound together and have

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,120
breakfast deal. We'll all be friends and

150
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,720
be collaborative." And I hope he's a

151
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
nice guy. I wish you well. I hope you're

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
happy. And uh uh No, but she wants to

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,039
have another one. And uh maybe we will.

154
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,960
We'll see. We'll see. All right. You got

155
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,400
a job for me? You always have a job.

156
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,680
Coming up, Alex going to open up about

157
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,520
the serious surgery which he actually

158
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,039
had that has changed his life and how

159
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,880
playing Donald Trump on Saturday Night

160
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,520
Live is affecting his health. His

161
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,800
interesting answer when we come

162
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,440
back. We're back with the one and only

163
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,479
Alec Baldwin. Had serious surgery this

164
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,639
past winter, a hip replacement. Well, I

165
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,199
went along and uh uh I you know, I had

166
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,720
back pain and I'd hurt my back and that

167
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,199
was a condition that would come and go

168
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,840
and sometimes get worse uh uh from a

169
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,240
from an injury I did doing a play in New

170
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,400
York many years ago. And then uh the

171
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,240
summer of last year, like 2007, I'm

172
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
playing tennis and I felt a pain I never

173
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,520
felt before. And I was like, "Oh my god,

174
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,800
what is that?" And I go in and I get

175
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,360
x-rayed and they said, "You're bone on

176
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,960
bone." And uh I have a congenital

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,080
displacia. You're a doctor, so you know

178
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,199
what that is. That's when your hips are

179
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,639
born a little wide. That's why they put

180
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,240
those kids in little binders sometimes

181
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,400
when they're young and the the the the

182
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
the ball doesn't fit into the socket

183
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,160
properly and so forth. So it's your

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,639
mother's fault. Yeah. Well, believe me,

185
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,639
I'm happy to I called her again. Another

186
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,400
thing that I owe to you, you know, but

187
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,680
uh the um uh the I I I go and they say

188
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
to me they're going to have the surgery,

189
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
which is very very complicated because

190
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,680
you have to have at least a couple weeks

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,960
you can lay low and not do anything. So

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,360
I had this one done. I have to have the

193
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,120
other one done. But I tell people uh

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,880
when they do that, I say uh get x-rayed

195
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,720
when you're like in your 40s and find

196
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,080
out, do you have that dysplacia? I mean,

197
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,599
see a doctor and have them tell you. You

198
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,120
know, this is the the 10th year of the

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,120
show. I'm not a doctor, but No, you but

200
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,120
you play one on talk shows, which we'll

201
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,520
get to in a second. Uh but when I

202
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,960
started the show, uh we hip replacement,

203
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,440
people always thought it was a an older

204
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,360
person's problem. Well, I would I played

205
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,120
football on weekends with my friends

206
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,759
till I was 40 years old. I played

207
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,840
tennis. I'd ski. I mean even when I was

208
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,800
and this is critically I think

209
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,720
significant is even excuse me even when

210
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
I was heavy and I got really overweight

211
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
and bloated from you know uh from my

212
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
later on we'll talk about my sugar

213
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,720
condition and when I gained weight from

214
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,720
that I still felt strong and I would you

215
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
know I go chop wood and I I felt good

216
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
you know what I mean and when this hip

217
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,800
thing happened I did not feel good I was

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,240
in so much pain I was nauseous every day

219
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,440
since you didn't really have a lot of

220
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,800
background in this when you walked out

221
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,000
of the doctor's office and he said hey

222
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,440
you've got bone on bone you're going to

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,840
have had your hip replaced. What were

224
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,240
you feeling? I was so depressed. Well,

225
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,000
because you you you hit that age. I'm 60

226
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
and I felt good. I mean, even, like I

227
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,840
say, even when I was heavy, I felt like

228
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,520
I could do things and play and run and

229
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,800
do this. And when this happened, you

230
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,639
start to think about, well, now I'm a

231
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
car that the parts are falling off the

232
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
car. I'm a car. The car is going down

233
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
the road. It's got no hub caps and the

234
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,120
fenders hanging off and the car. And now

235
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
I'm thinking going, oh god, that's me.

236
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,639
I'm that car now. you know, and it's

237
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,560
very uh uh uh demoralizing when you face

238
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,840
something, anything we have, I mean,

239
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,639
you're a doctor, you know, this anything

240
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,639
you face that is just has a whiff of

241
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,720
mortality. Yes. You start to get very

242
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,719
emotional. So, well, you know, one of

243
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,479
the reasons I love your wife is posted

244
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,959
this beautiful picture of of holding

245
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,399
Alex hand in in the recovery room and,

246
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,680
you know, I know she took good care of

247
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,479
you. Do you think you were a good

248
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,360
patient? Uh, were you whining all the

249
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,080
time, moping around? I had I I had uh

250
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,000
hernia surgery uh years ago. I had the

251
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,399
little groin hernia and I I I had

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,120
surgery uh back in 2006 or I forget when

253
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,480
quite a while ago. And uh when I'm done,

254
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,560
this woman that was the head of the

255
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,800
recovery room was this uh you know,

256
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,720
middle-aged African-American woman. She

257
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,880
had all the credentials on her. She was

258
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,959
the head lady. And I wake up from the

259
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,040
surgery and you know they give you some

260
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,080
pretty space age drugs when they're

261
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,880
going to cut you open. You know what I

262
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,760
mean? And I wake up in the thing and she

263
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,600
says, "Mr. Baldwin, I'm Muriel so and

264
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,720
so. I'm the head of the ICU." And I lit

265
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,240
I literally literally I go,

266
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,720
"Muriel, I love you,

267
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:31,040
man. I love you, baby." Like I was so

268
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,959
happy to be alive. Yes. And when they

269
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,800
put you under, I think, what if I don't

270
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,519
wake up, you know? And when I woke up, I

271
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,040
was like, "Have dinner with me, Muriel."

272
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,279
Well, you was loving with the Ari when

273
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,440
you recognized her. My wife is uh I'm

274
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,440
very lucky. My wife is the easiest

275
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,839
person to love I've ever met in my life.

276
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,680
Oh, she's the easiest person to like.

277
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,000
She's the easiest person to love. She's

278
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,839
the easiest person to be around. And the

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,839
other day I was saying something to her.

280
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,360
We were arguing about something. And my

281
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,720
wife literally turns to me. She goes, "I

282
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,560
like, you know, tomorrow you're going to

283
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,720
wake up and say I love you and I cannot

284
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,160
live without you." She goes, "So why

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,279
don't we just jump to that right now?"

286
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,160
And I thought, "Oh my god, she's funny.

287
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,120
I know she's been hammering you a little

288
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,480
bit on your diet. I I hear this, you

289
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,000
know, through social channels. Well, she

290
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,519
holds up a mirror. She doesn't hammer.

291
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,440
She's Yeah, she's very laid-back, but

292
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,959
she does say, you know, whatever you

293
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
want to do, and we can talk about that,

294
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,560
you know, my whole pre-diabetic. Let's

295
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,600
do that. Explain to everybody because

296
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
you've learned a lot about it. Well,

297
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,399
you're trim and you've been trim your

298
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,079
whole life. Well, I So, I played

299
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,680
football in college and when I Where'd

300
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,839
you go? At Harvard. Where'd you play?

301
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,440
Safety. Oh my god. And I uh I was

302
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,560
bigger. You were bigger. Yeah, I was I

303
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
was bigger. It was mostly muscle, but I

304
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,519
had fat on. And then when I became a

305
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,600
physician, I saw a lot of people who

306
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,279
were heavy, not doing well. And I

307
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,560
thought to myself, I'd rather be a

308
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,720
slimmer version of myself and live

309
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,480
longer for the people I love, right? And

310
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,560
that I really I've talked to the

311
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,560
audience many times. If you make it easy

312
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,880
to do the right thing, it happens. But

313
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
diabetes sneaks up on folks not just

314
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,279
because of weight, for other reasons as

315
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,360
well. Some people are genetically

316
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,519
predisposed. And when you do have

317
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,959
diabetes or pre-diabetes, it changes a

318
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,120
lot. It has that that as you mentioned

319
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,440
that that whiff of mortality. Well, I

320
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,680
think the other thing is I I go and I

321
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,600
had Lyme disease. No, no, I had I had a

322
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,279
kidney stone. And I go into the doctor

323
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,360
and he does my blood work and he goes,

324
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,200
"Hey man, your sugar is insane. We did

325
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
your blood work. Your sugar is nuts."

326
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,560
And he goes, "I think you're diabetic or

327
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
you're pre-diabetic." And then in the

328
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,640
ensuing six or seven months, I was going

329
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,920
to do a movie. I wanted to lose weight.

330
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,440
And I lost 35 pounds in a six or

331
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,360
eightmonth period to go do this movie

332
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,920
Blue Jasmine for Woody Allen. Yes. And

333
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm there uh uh and and the whole idea

334
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,360
was that uh uh you know even my doctor

335
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,600
said I've never seen in my professional

336
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,920
career in my entire medical career

337
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,920
someone crash their numbers their A1C

338
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,399
numbers everything as effectively as you

339
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,640
did but by losing weight. No by by

340
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,200
manipulating diet only. No cookies,

341
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,720
mints, candy, fruit, ice cream, no

342
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,519
dessert, no no uh uh pasta, bread, rice,

343
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,519
any grains. It was salad and fish and

344
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,839
and and and vegetables and so forth for

345
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,920
quite a while. I lost 35 pounds. I felt

346
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,440
great. But what I've learned in my life

347
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,800
and for everybody, I have to say this,

348
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
and I'm not just saying this because you

349
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,800
because you're a friend. I mean,

350
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,160
obviously I respect medicine and doctors

351
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,440
and you have to talk to your doctor and

352
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,360
they got to tell you what's going on.

353
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,160
But for me, it was like as if I could

354
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,320
just stop eating sugar. Yes. I stopped

355
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,480
eating sugar and my weight would go, my

356
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,200
numbers would go bang and I'd feel

357
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,880
great. Now again, my wife is the one

358
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
that taught me the metaphor of the

359
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,160
brimming cup. If you eat a little bit of

360
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
sugar and then you don't eat it for

361
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,120
three or four days, then you eat a

362
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,800
little bit of sugar, then it goes down.

363
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,959
But if you eat it and then eat it, then

364
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,760
then it spills over. The cup is full.

365
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,160
That's when I feel so sick. It makes me

366
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,839
sick. When I don't do it, I feel great.

367
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,200
So talk to a doctor. Talk to an

368
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,279
endocrinologist and make sure you're

369
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,399
doing but with and I'll tell you as a

370
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
doctor, let me speak to the doctor side

371
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,639
of this. It's a lot easier for us to

372
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,160
manage you if you're doing the diet

373
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,120
stuff on your own cuz it's hard for me

374
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,240
to sprinkle insulin on a cookie. It

375
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,320
doesn't quite work like you think it

376
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,959
would work. That's a great idea. That's

377
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,760
right. Why don't we go bake some insulin

378
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,079
cookies right now? Next on the dock

379
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,320
garage. Yeah. No, but but you're you're

380
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,399
very right in that the less sugar I eat,

381
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,880
the better I feel. All right. Up next,

382
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,399
more with Alec Bowwin. Stay with us.

383
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,399
That was a clip from the new Alec

384
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,120
Baldwin show. It's on ABC. It's right

385
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,040
across the studio uh from here. You

386
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,880
enjoy it? Well, I have four kids. I need

387
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,079
all the money I can get my hands on. I

388
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,480
need money. I need a big bag of money.

389
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,720
These kids cost me a fortune. It's

390
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
driving me nuts, you know. But no, the

391
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,639
show was another example of a way to

392
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,480
stay home and shooting things and

393
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,399
developing projects where I can stay

394
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,680
with my family. That's the priority. So,

395
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,360
do you enjoy the show? You enjoy talking

396
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,959
to folks? Well, I love doing a show. I

397
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,600
mean, you do a show every day, which is

398
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,519
a different grind. I can't even express

399
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,920
to you how tough it is to do a daily

400
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,920
show. It's really tough. Fallon and you

401
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,320
and Coar and everybody that's on every

402
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,639
day. That's a really really uh different

403
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
muscle. And for me, we shoot in bundles.

404
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,160
We get a stage in this building as you

405
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,000
know. Sometimes we've actually borrowed

406
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,560
your set. I'm on the phone going, "Is Oz

407
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,560
out of there yet? Get him out of there

408
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,480
now." And we come and we shoot match

409
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,040
game in this building and we shoot uh uh

410
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,440
the talk show and we do it in bundles.

411
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,800
So we we clear out a week or two, book

412
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,880
all the guests we can and we bring them

413
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,279
on and hopefully we book people where

414
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,120
it's something that the audience wants

415
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,800
and I'm interested in them at the same

416
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,399
time. Yeah. One of the biggest stages of

417
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
all is Saturday Night Live, the iconic

418
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,519
program that we all have grown up with

419
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,120
and is still dominant. And you're

420
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,880
playing Donald Trump again this year,

421
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,519
which is uh you all love him, Miss

422
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,959
Donald Trump. Now it's fantastic. I I I

423
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,160
I know it's fun or you wouldn't do it.

424
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,680
There's one guy in the in the in the in

425
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,440
the in the fuchsia colored shirt there

426
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,760
with the glasses. He did not clap when

427
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,360
they said no. I didn't know. Now he's

428
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,600
clapping. I hope we have I always hope

429
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,760
we have one Donald Trump fan in the

430
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,839
audience. And you can tell cuz everybody

431
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,320
else go, "That's so And one guy's like,

432
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,720
I hate that Alec

433
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,000
Har. He's horrible." But but there is a

434
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,360
lot of stress since you mentioned Donald

435
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,440
Trump fans. There's a lot of stress when

436
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,920
people come after you personally uh when

437
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,519
they don't like what you're doing to

438
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,360
imitate as talented as it is. I've

439
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,920
really gotten to the point where uh you

440
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:22,399
know, first of all, America right now is

441
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,320
a place which is a boiling pot of very

442
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,000
intense opinions. You know, Americans

443
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,760
are very on both sides are very upset

444
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,760
and they're very angry. people who don't

445
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,440
who think that Trump is someone who does

446
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,720
not represent what the chief executive

447
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,199
of a of the the

448
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,720
uh um commander-in-chief of the country

449
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,560
should be and other people who think

450
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,720
he's exactly what he should be and that

451
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,839
I've never seen people argue about that

452
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,880
more in my lifetime than now and I think

453
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,440
that in this country uh if we change the

454
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,519
campaign finance system in this country

455
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,839
that is the lynch pin of all the

456
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,360
problems in America today it's very

457
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,880
painful Would you ever run for office? I

458
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,040
tell you the truth, I would love to run

459
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,959
for office. I think I would be a great

460
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,759
president. We would have insulins coated

461
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,000
cookies in the White

462
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:16,079
House. Me Oz, Dr. Oz would come sprinkle

463
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,639
the insulin on the cookies for

464
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,519
Thanksgiving and for Halloween. Uh, and

465
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,440
no, I I think seriously, there is a part

466
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:27,360
of me that would love to try to bring

467
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,279
again what I call common sense. There's

468
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,880
things that you know and that you know

469
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,680
and that we know that the government

470
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,360
should be doing in education and in and

471
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,720
in infrastructure and so forth. There's

472
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,320
just things we need to get straightened

473
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,360
out because the United States really is

474
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,360
behind so many other countries in in

475
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,880
technology and so forth. But my wife

476
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,120
said she would divorce me if I ran for

477
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,639
office. So she did. Yeah. So in the

478
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,079
meantime, how long will you keep playing

479
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,199
portraying Donald Trump on Saturday

480
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,959
Night Live?

481
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,759
Um well that's tough to say. You know,

482
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,800
if if if I have a fifth child, I'm gonna

483
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,160
be a greeter in Vegas at a hotel to pay

484
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,519
my bills. We don't have no time for

485
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,520
Trump. I'm gonna be like, "Hey, I'm Alec

486
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,120
Baldwin." Remember me? I was in

487
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,880
Beetlejuice. I was in Bele. Well,

488
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,720
meanwhile, cuz the Hawks new show, the

489
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
Alec Baldwin show airs Sunday nights on

490
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,439
ABC. What time? Uh I here's what I

491
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,480
suggest. I think it's it could be 9:00.

492
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,919
It could be 10 o'clock. I don't

493
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,160
remember. But why don't you just put the

494
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,439
channel on ABC at like 6 o'clock in the

495
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,360
afternoon? Right after the football

496
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,640
game. Watch the football game. I'm all

497
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,280
for that. Then right after the football

498
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,039
game, go to ABC and leave it there on

499
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,640
Sunday nights. Thank you for watching.
