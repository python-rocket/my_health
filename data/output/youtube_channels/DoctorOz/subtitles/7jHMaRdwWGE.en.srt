00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,400
An all new Alzheimer's alert. We're

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,000
giving you an insiders guide to the

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,759
latest Alzheimer's breakthroughs that

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,599
you've been seeing in the headlines.

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,679
Could your body type determine your

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,840
risk? We've not talked about this on the

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,240
show before. One body type is at a

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,640
higher risk of getting the disease. It's

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,199
going to surprise you which one. Plus,

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,080
is pasta now a health food booth? The

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,430
truth about the new protein pastas.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,920
Coming up next.

forefront of brain research and

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,039
prevention in order to keep you one step

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,199
ahead. And today, we're giving you an

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,799
insiders guide to the latest Alzheimer's

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,799
breakthroughs that you've been seeing in

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,799
the headlines with a power team of

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,119
experts to give you practical steps you

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,520
can use now to reduce your risk. Dr.

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,600
Rudy Tanzy is here to tell you what you

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,680
need to know about the new Alzheimer's

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,320
drug he co-developed that the whole

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,320
world is watching right now. Dr. Isaiah

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,720
Sherzai, who is going to break down the

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,400
latest research revealing how your body

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,080
type could affect your chances of

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,479
getting the disease, and bestselling

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,400
author Max Labir, who made discovering

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,320
and sharing Alzheimer's research's

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,960
mission after his young mother was

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,200
diagnosed. Now, today, Max has three new

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,280
genius foods from his book that can help

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,119
reduce your risk of Alzheimer's disease.

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,240
Max, thank you as well for being here.

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,079
Thanks for having me. So, the

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,320
interesting thing about this food

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
pyramid is that you interviewed hundreds

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
of experts. So, it's a lot of work.

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,520
Hundreds of experts thinking that food

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,439
is medicine, right? And it turned out

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,520
that you literally could turn things

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,040
upside down with this food pyramid. What

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
did you find? Yeah, Dr. Oz, that's

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,759
exactly what we should be doing. You

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,920
know, we've been given dietary advice

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,079
over the past couple of decades that was

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
upside down, you know. So, what I think

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,280
that we should do is invert the food

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,640
pyramid. And, you know, we can make some

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
modifications, too. I think, you know,

60
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,879
vegetables should really be the base um

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
for most people. But the central thing

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,480
that I've learned amid all of the

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,480
interviews that I've given is that the

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,000
one question that every doctor should

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,840
ask their patient is what are you

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
eating? And this applies certainly to

67
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
brain doctors. New research is beginning

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,000
to show. Let's get into some details.

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,520
So, first of all, this overarching

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,760
approach to eating is gaining a lot of

71
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,440
traction among Alzheimer's researchers.

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,640
It's called intermittent fasting. Now,

73
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,319
we've talked about fasting

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,840
intermittently for people who want to

75
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,080
lose weight, but you say it's actually

76
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,599
essential for brain health. So, walk me

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
through this metaphor. We got a car.

78
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,280
Yeah. So, your brain, I like to say, is

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,360
like the universe's most advanced

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,760
hybrid. And like a hybrid car, your

81
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,239
brain can run off of two fuel sources.

82
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,239
Okay? So, for one, we've got gasoline.

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,879
In the brain, the gasoline is like the

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,800
sugar, the glucose that the brain uses.

85
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,640
And then the other fuel source that the

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
brain can use is sort of like the

87
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,920
brain's battery, the brain's

88
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,920
electricity. They're called ketones.

89
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,680
Yeah. Now, I like to say that when the

90
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,840
brain is running on electricity, it's

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,440
sort of like a Tesla, okay? A very fast

92
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,920
car. On the other hand, when the brain

93
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,000
is using sugar for fuel, it's sort of

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,080
like a jalapy. It's chugging along.

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,080
Sugar produces exhaust. It produces

96
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
toxic byproducts essentially. And

97
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
ketones, on the other hand, can be

98
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,879
thought of sort of as like a clean

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
burning fuel source. So again, the

100
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,560
metaphor is simple. Your car can use gas

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,720
and batteries. Your body can use sugar

102
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
or ketones. One's a little better than

103
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
the other. And as we realize that, we

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
get to appreciate the power we have as

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,640
individuals. So to become more ketone

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,560
using, yeah, you suggest intermittent

107
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,000
fasting. And I just put a clock up here.

108
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,440
Walk us through an example of how this

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,040
might work. So, when would you stop

110
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,680
eating? Yeah. So, typically what I would

111
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,280
do is I would stop eating by 6:00 p.m.

112
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
And then I wouldn't eat anything else. I

113
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,799
would drink water, of course, but I

114
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,799
wouldn't eat any other calories until

115
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,640
8:00 a.m. the next day. What that

116
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,720
essentially does is it allows your body

117
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,319
a chance to rev up that ketone

118
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,159
production that again is like the

119
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,920
electricity for your brain. It's a very

120
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,840
clean burning fuel source. And the

121
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,599
latest research suggests that's actually

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,799
a a really great thing for the brain.

123
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah. So guys, is it hard? I don't know.

124
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,080
I Yeah, I I I think it could be a little

125
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
bit of a challenge, but getting

126
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,440
Alzheimer's is pretty difficult, too. I

127
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,840
actually am doing a 12-h hour

128
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,240
intermittent fast. So, I'll stop eating

129
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
at 8 in the evening, and I'll start my

130
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
breakfast at around 8:00 in the morning.

131
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
And that's not that hard. Yeah, Dr.

132
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,560
Ross, a really good way to think about

133
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,919
it is that at a certain point in the

134
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,600
evening, like when it gets really dark,

135
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,000
a few hours before bed, the kitchen

136
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,199
closes in the body, so to speak. So at

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
that point, you kind of want to like

138
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
taper off your food consumption and then

139
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,240
start it up again during the daytime

140
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,080
because humans are meant to eat during

141
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,520
the day, not at night, especially not

142
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,280
before bed. Yeah. And then like food

143
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,800
sits in your small intestine. It begins

144
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,479
cause all the problems, but most

145
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,479
importantly for the brain, it changes

146
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,080
the fuel source that we have. So now

147
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,840
that you know when to eat, let's talk

148
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,600
about what to eat. Mac has Max has three

149
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,600
foods that everyone at home ought to be

150
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
eating today. He calls them well, I

151
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,040
mean, they're special, but let's clarify

152
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,800
what these genius foods are. You're not

153
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,960
going to actually be smarter

154
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,960
immediately, right? You're not going to

155
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,400
get rid of all dementia with this. You

156
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,520
might feel smarter. You might feel

157
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
smarter because you're being smart in

158
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,160
what you're eating. What does it mean to

159
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,759
be a genius food? Yeah. So, these are

160
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,720
foods that have a strong body of

161
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,080
evidence to say that they're going to

162
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,400
boost the way that your brain works

163
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,560
today and also help give it a little bit

164
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,000
of a sword and shield against aging

165
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,880
tomorrow so that you can help fend off

166
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
some of these conditions like

167
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,600
Alzheimer's disease. All right. The

168
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,280
first genius food everybody simple in

169
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,680
order to cut your risk of Alzheimer's is

170
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,759
cacao. Right? Cacao is a great source of

171
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
polyphenols. We love chocolate. Anyway,

172
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,759
I personally, nobody likes chocolate

173
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,440
here. Thank you. You're going to rush

174
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,960
the stage to get these. How does it

175
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,120
actually help with brain health? Yeah,

176
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,800
so it's one of the top sources of

177
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
magnesium, which is very important for

178
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,320
brain health. Keep talking. What you

179
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,639
eating back here? Yeah, it's full of uh

180
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,320
what are called flavonols that um

181
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,880
research shows can actually boost the

182
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,240
way that the memory works. And so, we've

183
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,360
got this delicious cacao powder here. Um

184
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,600
the key when uh you know buying cacao is

185
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,960
that most frequently it's processed into

186
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,120
chocolate. That's typically how we

187
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,759
consume it uh in the United States and

188
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,960
and around the world. Thank you. You

189
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,160
just want to make sure that the

190
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,080
chocolate bar that you're getting has a

191
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,280
high percentage, a high cacao percentage

192
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,639
so that it doesn't contain a lot of

193
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,479
sugar because the more sugar is in the

194
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,880
bar, that sugar is going to negate the

195
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,319
benefits of eating cacao. So you want as

196
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,800
little sugar as possible. We didn't add

197
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,720
sugar to this. Thumbs up or down? It's

198
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,440
good. It's good. M they're happy happy

199
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,520
people. These are made simply with Yeah.

200
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,120
I mean, frankly, it's smart just to eat

201
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,520
them. Period. You might be smarter.

202
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,520
That's up to you. All right. Next. This

203
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,479
genius

204
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,240
food arguably will help with

205
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,000
Alzheimer's, but it's one of my favorite

206
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,280
foods of all, and I have never talked

207
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,319
about it on the show. It's herring. Now,

208
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,479
this fatty fish has landed on the top of

209
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,919
Alzheimer's researchers lists of the

210
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,440
best fish to have, which I didn't

211
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,720
realize. It's even more reason to eat

212
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,840
it. Now, I don't know how good it's

213
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,520
going to go with the chocolate that I

214
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,280
still have in my mouth. But there's

215
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,120
always room for herring. I Oh, this

216
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,880
summer I was eating all kinds of fish. I

217
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,479
was posting on Instagram continually,

218
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,000
but the herring was what got my

219
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,080
attention. I would eat it for breakfast,

220
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,039
lunch, and dinner. It's a top source of

221
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,720
DHA fat, which is an incredible building

222
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,720
block for healthy brain cells. We now

223
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,199
know that the adult brain, you can grow

224
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,280
new brain cells up until your last day

225
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,599
on Earth. So, it's incredible. And the

226
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,680
other bonus feature of herring that uh I

227
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,680
think is super cool, herring is the top

228
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,520
dietary source of a compound called

229
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
creatine, which basically helps

230
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,280
supplement brain energy. It helps

231
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,430
support brain energy metabolism. Who has

232
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,880
never had herring before?

233
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,000
[Laughter]

234
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
Let me see. Let me see your hands up

235
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,240
again. So many people. All right.

236
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,560
Challenge. Take it there. Okay. Let's

237
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,440
see his smile. Here also he finally

238
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,680
admitted it. Okay. Never had it before.

239
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,080
Watch their eyes. Yes or no? It's a

240
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,479
thumbs up. Not sure. What does it taste

241
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,879
like? It It tastes very fishy and they

242
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,440
can pickle it. Yes. I I taste the

243
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,800
pickling aspect of it. If you like fish,

244
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,039
this is what you want to have. But

245
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
herring is inexpensive. Yeah. I'm

246
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,639
hearing not bad. All right. So, the

247
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,160
audience is lukewarm, but I understand

248
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,440
you've never had herring either, Max.

249
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,919
Yeah, I've read about it. I've read

250
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,479
about the benefits, but uh you know, I'm

251
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,879
I've never tried it. So, your your

252
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,319
assessment? My assessment is it's

253
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,599
definitely good. It's it's very pickled.

254
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,120
Um it's it's it's very tangy. Uh and

255
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,360
with that slimy fishlike consistency, um

256
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,879
you know, and with the chocolate that I

257
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
had in my mouth. No, Max, stop making

258
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,640
excuses. If you like fish, you guys see

259
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,320
he actually liked it. No, you're going

260
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,320
to like it. It's very It was good. And

261
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
you know, just give it a one shot. I

262
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
don't have to get everyone in America to

263
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,080
like hear her, but I want it to be on

264
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,000
our radar screen cuz you guys have

265
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
forgotten about it. And it is so good.

266
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,680
So good. Take the herring challenge. The

267
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,320
herring challenge. Yes. We'll call it

268
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,519
the lug herring

269
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,480
challenge. The next genius food is

270
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,760
portoella mushrooms. I mean, I love it.

271
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
Mushrooms anyway, but why are they so

272
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,680
good for the brain? Mushrooms are a

273
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,640
nutritional powerhouse. Dr. Oz, they're

274
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,360
a potent source of um a powerful brain

275
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
antioxidant called glutathione. And you

276
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,839
know, mushrooms are just across the

277
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,000
board. They're full of vitamins. They're

278
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,200
a very low carbohydrate food. You know,

279
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,040
one thing that I like to do, so we've

280
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,080
got porttoella mushrooms here. It's a

281
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,720
really great uh healthy swap to use the

282
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,760
cap of a porttoella mushroom as the bun

283
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,760
on a grass-fed burger. Yes. Yeah. Think

284
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,440
about this. You remember that movement

285
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,160
we had in the '9s? We wanted people to

286
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,279
replace their hamburgers with these caps

287
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,720
of mushrooms. Did anyone go for that?

288
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,880
Like two people in the back and they're

289
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
being stoned, right? It didn't have

290
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,920
impressive results. People just didn't

291
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,839
do it. So, we're flipping the script.

292
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,360
We're going to break the stem off.

293
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,200
Right. You can cook this too, by the

294
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,519
way, separately. This becomes your bun.

295
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,560
A non-carbohydrate bun. And then put the

296
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,959
burger on here that mayo, lettuce,

297
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,800
mustard, whatever else. Another one. It

298
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,920
is fantastic. In fact, the bun will be

299
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,279
the burger. And we're going to prove it

300
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,800
to you. We got a recipe video that

301
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,279
you're going to love as we head into the

302
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,959
break. Plus, what your body type says

303
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,920
about your Alzheimer's risk. It is going

304
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,920
to shock you. That is next.

305
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,710
[Music]

306
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,710
[Applause]

307
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:17,220
[Music]

308
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,279
Hey,

309
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,550
[Music]

310
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:44,240
hey, hey.

311
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:47,600
[Music]

312
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,600
an all new true crime

313
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,880
investigation. How could one surgeon

314
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,600
harm so many?

315
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,600
I take the fifth. That's coming up

316
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
tomorrow.

317
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,160
We're back with Dr. Aisha Sherzai,

318
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
author of the Alzheimer's Solution with

319
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,279
another Alzheimer's alert. And pay

320
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,959
attention because we're going to show

321
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,240
you how your body type, the way your

322
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,760
body's proportion, can actually

323
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,519
determine your risk of getting the

324
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,680
disease. Now, take a look at this. One

325
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,040
of these women is more at risk or could

326
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,440
be more at risk than the others for

327
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,760
Alzheimer's. Can you spot the one who's

328
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,839
at risk for their brain health just by

329
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
looking at their

330
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,760
body? It's confusing, isn't it? Right.

331
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,600
There's a new study that suggests one

332
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,519
body type is at a higher risk of getting

333
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,839
the disease. It's going to surprise you

334
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,519
which one. So, Dr. Shzai, what would the

335
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
research say about which body type is

336
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,000
most dangerous? Can you tell by looking?

337
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,720
I can't, but it could be any one of

338
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
them. It actually depends on how the

339
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,120
body stores fat. So, the term skinny

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,440
fat, it actually is a legitimate medical

341
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,000
problem where your percentage of body

342
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,360
fat is higher than your muscle. And that

343
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,200
actually puts you at a higher risk for

344
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,120
Alzheimer's disease. So any of these

345
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,360
women Exactly. All right. So being

346
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,399
skinny isn't the goal. No, no, it

347
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,880
doesn't, you know, it doesn't mean

348
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,800
anything. It all depends on how your

349
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,480
body's fat is stored and what is the

350
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
difference between the amount of fat and

351
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,160
muscle in your body. All right. So you

352
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,160
call that body fat composition. Exactly.

353
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,760
And just to elucidate this, your body is

354
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
made up of muscle and fat. And yes,

355
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,320
there's some water, but we're going to

356
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
focus on the muscle and the fat right

357
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,519
now. And the best way to measure your

358
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,440
Alzheimer's risk is actually to look at

359
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,360
this body fat composition. And here's

360
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,920
why. This is a cross-section, for

361
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
example, of the thigh, right? And so you

362
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,720
can see that someone can be the same

363
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,880
weight, right? Same same width of thigh,

364
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,440
but this person has a lot of muscle and

365
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,680
not much fat. It's lean. This person has

366
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
got no muscle, but a lot of fat, but

367
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,480
they weigh the same, right? Muscle

368
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,880
weighs more than fat, by the way. That's

369
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,160
why fat floats. So you can have a little

370
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,279
bit itty bitty muscle in there with a

371
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,880
lot of fat around it, and you won't

372
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,560
weigh very much. So are the traditional

373
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,240
ways that we look at how much you weigh

374
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,600
and whether you're thin or not, your

375
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,200
body mass index, they don't seem to

376
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,639
work. Absolutely. And and for

377
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,959
Alzheimer's, so what is what should we

378
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,440
be doing? So the most important thing

379
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,680
for us to understand is that muscle

380
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
building is very important. A lot of us

381
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,639
may look at a person and you know he or

382
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,800
she may be skinny, but that doesn't

383
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,720
necessarily mean they're healthy. The

384
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,720
content of fat is very important. If

385
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,040
they have more muscle, they actually are

386
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,959
metabolically more active and they're

387
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,639
very strong. They actually have bigger

388
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,000
brains, better brains, and they lower

389
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,360
their risk for Alzheimer's disease. All

390
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,399
right, so if you can't jump on a scale

391
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,560
and figure this out, if you can't look

392
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,160
at a picture and figure it out, yes,

393
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,200
you're left with a whole another way.

394
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,720
This is really important. We've not

395
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,480
talked about this on the show before,

396
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,560
there's a very effective way of

397
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,519
measuring your body fat percentage, and

398
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,480
it has to do with this. Come on over

399
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,720
here, show everyone what this is. This

400
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,279
is a caliper. Well, this is a wonderful

401
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,760
little um you know, you know, thing that

402
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,600
you can buy for five or 10 bucks off of,

403
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,360
you know, the internet or anywhere, but

404
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,760
it actually is quite accurate to tell

405
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
you the amount of fat that you have. And

406
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,880
there's a particular way, there's

407
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,760
several ways to measure your body fat

408
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,000
composition. But the easiest way, as far

409
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,240
as I'm concerned, is you check the body

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,199
fat in your in your arm. Actually, we're

411
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,639
going to do it together with Leanne,

412
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,560
who's backstage right now. She

413
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,079
volunteered to have her body fat

414
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,360
composition measured. So, we're going to

415
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
do it. I'll do it here. She'll do it

416
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
there. I'm gonna meet her here in one

417
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,560
second. Excellent. Okay. For those of

418
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,160
you who are at home, you don't have a

419
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,720
way of take of making measurements yet.

420
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,480
We've got a simple checklist, but pay

421
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
attention to this because these calipers

422
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,000
are going to be part of what you they're

423
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,519
great for parties. Get them. You can

424
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,440
measure your friend's fat. They're going

425
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,959
to love you. Okay. So, sure they will.

426
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,160
So, so you measure in three places,

427
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,920
right? Okay. So, you're going to measure

428
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,440
it so it relax your arm. So, you

429
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,519
basically find a midpoint between your

430
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,519
shoulder and your elbow and you pinch

431
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,199
your fat. Gosh, it's kind of difficult

432
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,600
to pinch. You don't have any fat. She's

433
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,600
patronizing me. No, no, it's true. Okay,

434
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,800
let's just go and give an example. Give

435
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,320
give the one that everyone's embarrassed

436
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
about. This isn't bad. Okay. And then

437
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,040
you do it in the belly. So, you know,

438
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,399
about 2 in uh over your hipbone. So,

439
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,160
somewhere here, you take a diagonal

440
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,839
pinch and then you basically pinch it

441
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,600
like that. And then you hear a little

442
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,680
click and that kind of tells you to

443
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,839
stop. And then you measure it. See, for

444
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,880
example, for you it's about a centime

445
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,000
about, you know, a less than a

446
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,360
centimeter. A little bit. Yeah. And then

447
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,560
you do it in the thigh again. And you do

448
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,000
it in the thigh. You know, a point

449
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
between your knee and your hip. And

450
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,240
there's a chart when you get these

451
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,000
things and they are about five bucks.

452
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,279
They're not much these calipers. We'll

453
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,199
tell you where to put numbers and you

454
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,040
can calculate your body fat percentage.

455
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,839
So Leanne from our audience is here now.

456
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,079
Now before the show, she was measured. I

457
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,639
saw you backstage. Hi. How are you? How

458
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,680
are you? Hi. How are you? I have the

459
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,279
calipers, but I'm not going to use them

460
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,120
on you. Okay. What What did they find?

461
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,839
Do you know? I don't know what the final

462
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,920
number is, but I know that I um I am

463
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,760
this skinny fat person you're talking

464
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,720
about. Yes, I heard that. So, what are

465
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,760
you going to do differently with these

466
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,199
results now that you know that you're

467
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,199
skinny fat and you're not alone. A lot

468
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,040
of folks are. Well, I mean, I get a lot

469
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,600
more active. I do I actually have a gy

470
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,560
gym membership. Um, and I go, you know,

471
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,560
occasionally say hi. Um, but I tend to

472
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,079
um I tend to like go straight for the

473
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,680
treadmill with the intention of getting

474
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,600
to the weights and doing all that kind

475
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,199
of stuff, but then I start looking at

476
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,880
the time or I spend more time on the

477
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,880
treadmill than I thought and I just, you

478
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,320
know, kind of ignore them as I walk out

479
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,480
the door. But it's also true for people

480
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,480
who go walking. There folks who go

481
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,480
listen do something that's the benefit

482
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,000
and please do that but in addition we're

483
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,600
asking women especially to do something

484
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,360
that actually allows them to lift their

485
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,120
own body weight. There are many reasons

486
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,040
to do that. We know more and more that

487
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,320
frailty is a major killer but that's not

488
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,440
what we're talking about today. The

489
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,639
frailty was going to hurt you is the

490
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,399
frailty that causes your brain to

491
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,160
atrophy and not be as strong. And the

492
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,160
best news of all was big thighs, big

493
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,360
brain. Absolutely. Hallelujah to that.

494
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,910
All right, everybody. I love that. We'll

495
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,200
be right back.

496
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,200
[Applause]

497
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,480
an uplose look at Alzheimer's in the

498
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,240
brain like we have never seen before and

499
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,680
how these new insights help develop a

500
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,639
new drug that you're going to want to

501
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,639
know about. Stay with

502
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:51,120
[Music]

503
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,360
us. He's been called a rock star of

504
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,440
science, credited with co-discovering

505
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,519
the first three Alzheimer's genes and

506
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,600
several more since. and now he has

507
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,920
co-developed the new Alzheimer's drug

508
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,079
that the whole world is watching. Please

509
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,919
welcome Harvard neurogeneticist and my

510
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,480
friend Dr. Woody T. Thank you for being

511
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,640
here. I got to tell Dr. Ted recently

512
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,120
told for a quote. He said we'll have a

513
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,880
solid plan for eradicating the world's

514
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:20,559
eradicating Alzheimer's disease by

515
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,839
2025. I I really trust you. No, I do.

516
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,120
And so when someone like you says that

517
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,559
means a lot to me. What makes you so

518
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,919
confident? Well, I think you know on one

519
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,079
hand we have to cure patients with

520
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
Alzheimer's, but we have to also stop

521
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,200
the next generations from getting this

522
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,919
disease. I think there's a true chance

523
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,760
to end this disease over the next decade

524
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,360
because there have been several major

525
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,440
discoveries just over the last few years

526
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,000
where now we know what's going wrong in

527
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,160
the brain 10 or 20 years before the

528
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,760
symptoms occur. So we eradicate it

529
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,520
early. Early detection, early

530
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,280
intervention would be the mantra. All

531
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,720
right. So Dr. has developed a new

532
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,080
promising drug using a brand new

533
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,559
technique that you're going to want to

534
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,320
see. Now, until now Alzheimer's has only

535
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,840
been studied in animals, right? You get

536
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
an animal, you create a model for

537
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,919
Alzheimer's, you try to do your best.

538
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,600
But Dr. Tanzy actually created a mini

539
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,400
human brain with the disease. He calls

540
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,240
it Alzheimer's in a dish. And this has

541
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,120
never been shown before on television.

542
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,039
We're going to show it to her for the

543
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,559
first time here. I wanted Tina to be

544
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,919
here. How are you, Tina?

545
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,799
because I think Tina like so many of you

546
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,799
has concerns about Alzheimer's and I

547
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,799
think this will help shine a big bright

548
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,240
light on the problem. So what is your

549
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,600
story? What makes you so worried about

550
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,679
Alzheimer's except that you're like the

551
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,160
average American? My grandmother passed

552
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,080
away from Alzheimer's last year. So I'm

553
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,880
very concerned about I watched her

554
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,880
deteriorate over the years and took care

555
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,200
of her and I'm very concerned of course

556
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,720
if I'm going to get it my mother my

557
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,600
daughter one day. So a preventative

558
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,880
would be great. Well, you know, you

559
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,440
really aren't alone. It's the single

560
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,760
most common concern that Americans are

561
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,280
telling me about. And so, when I see

562
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,720
that many folks worried about it and I

563
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,039
see someone like that who's got some

564
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,480
answers and real opportunities to change

565
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,080
the the course of human history, I want

566
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,440
to bring it together. But I've never

567
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,360
thought I'd see anything like what I'm

568
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
about to show you. Right. So, if you

569
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,520
don't mind, walk us through what we're

570
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,520
seeing this brain in a petri dish and

571
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,520
explain why it's so important. Well, you

572
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,880
know, for a long time, we were just

573
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,679
stuck with studying this disease in

574
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,400
mice, and most of us argued mice are not

575
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,080
people. So now we can take human nerve

576
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
cells made from stem cells. That's these

577
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,120
and that's it. And we're growing them in

578
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,039
a gel that mimics the brain because the

579
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,559
brain's like jell-o. And these nerve

580
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,640
cells are are interacting the way they

581
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,640
should and forming networks. And then we

582
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,960
can put into them the Alzheimer's genes

583
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,120
we discovered and have them create

584
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,840
Alzheimer's pathology in a petri dish in

585
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,840
a mini human brain organoid. That orange

586
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,200
blob is a plaque. And we know that's

587
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,880
amaloid plaque. That's amaloid plaque

588
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,280
forming in the dish around the green

589
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,200
blobs that are nerve cells. And then we

590
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,520
know that these amaloid plaques form in

591
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,600
the brain 20 years up to 20 years before

592
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,000
the symptoms occur. So this is the enemy

593
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,280
number one we have to hit first. So 20

594
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,880
years gets sort of close to home,

595
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,280
doesn't it? Yeah. Is your mom still

596
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,720
okay? My mom's still okay. All right.

597
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,320
But you start to worry with 20 years.

598
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,120
That's the head start that you need. All

599
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,160
right. So I'm going to show you

600
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,080
something now that really caught my

601
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,600
attention. So these little green things

602
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,600
are are are brain cells. And notice

603
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,440
there's a brain cell here with a little

604
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,799
green line going to, you know, out to

605
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,880
the distance where it talks to other

606
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,320
brain cells. Right now this is the part

607
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,840
that's sort of cool. These are all those

608
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,440
amaloid plaques you showed. Oh, these

609
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,120
are the little uh uh what are called

610
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,400
micro gleal cells. They're the they're

611
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,840
the they're the sentinels and

612
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,600
housekeepers in the brain that normally

613
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,960
keep the brain clean. Got it. Like

614
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,200
during deep sleep. All right. So you

615
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,120
have a green good brain cell, good guy,

616
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,039
and you have these garbage men or

617
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,240
sentinels. Yes. Okay. And normally

618
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,760
they're cleaning the brain, but when

619
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,159
they sense something's wrong, like the

620
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,080
plaques and the plaques in in the dish

621
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,600
called cause what we call tangles inside

622
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,520
the nerve cells, they say, "We got to

623
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,960
wipe out wipe this area out. We got to

624
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,880
take these damaged nerve cells and

625
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,080
remove them." Even if the nerve cells

626
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,919
are helping you, even if it's your best

627
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,240
connection to what your grandmother's

628
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,799
name is, that's the issue. Collateral

629
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,320
damage. Uhhuh. See? So watch this video,

630
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,559
okay? Watch this green line. Watch what

631
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,159
happens to this cell. So these guardians

632
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,159
now, they start to attack it. See them

633
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,840
eating away at it. And as they do, they

634
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,559
chew it up and all of a sudden you begin

635
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,159
to invade the space of the of the brain

636
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,240
cell. And so now you understand what's

637
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,159
going on, right? So these so these cells

638
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,840
that normally are protecting the brain

639
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,600
when they sense something's wrong, take

640
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,919
it out. They're taking out the bad nerve

641
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,840
cells, but by friendly fire, they take

642
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,480
out the good ones too. And now this is

643
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,320
when you go downhill. Now this has

644
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,919
significant implications for how you do

645
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,360
stuff because Dr. Tany has a new drug

646
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,960
that he developed that's designed to

647
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,960
stop this from happening. Right? Right?

648
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,200
So the tangles that confuse the

649
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,320
guardians don't ever form. The neurons

650
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,799
never die. Right. And and the whole idea

651
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,400
here is to do it early enough before the

652
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,080
symptoms occur just like we do with

653
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,080
other diseases. Alzheimer's has to catch

654
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,360
up to that. I hope that's helpful. I

655
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,440
hope so. Thank you so much. Glad you

656
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
come on over here.

657
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,559
And I want you all to understand this

658
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,400
mindset because it'll give you great

659
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,000
confidence. You actually described

660
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,679
amaloid fighting, you know, pushing

661
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,760
those plaques away similar to the way we

662
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,280
think about cholesterol. So you're

663
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,880
actually calling it a statin for the

664
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,960
brain if we can make a medication to do

665
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,159
it. Yes. My colleague uh Dr. Steven

666
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,400
Wagner at UCSD San Diego and I developed

667
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,640
a drug that will bring the amaloid

668
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,320
levels down in the brain. But it has to

669
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,919
be very safe because this is a drug like

670
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,640
a statin you might have to take for 10,

671
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,720
20, 30, 40 years. And that drug was

672
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,320
developed with the help of this dish.

673
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,400
And now we're going to be heading into

674
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,640
clinical trials hopefully by the end of

675
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,400
this year or next year. End of this year

676
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,240
uh if things go really well. But

677
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,679
definitely we think by next year. Yes.

678
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,559
Can I just show you what Dr. Katan is

679
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,799
talking about when it comes to these

680
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,360
cells. So I've got a regular old match

681
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,840
here. Okay. And I light this match and

682
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,640
this match as it gets lit up, right? It

683
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,480
imagine it as a formation of amaloid,

684
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,320
right? That's the equivalent. Now it's a

685
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,840
precursor to what will become full-blown

686
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,000
Alzheimer's, which in the case of this

687
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,559
match is like a forest fire erupting

688
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,320
behind me, right? So this big fire is up

689
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,200
there and drugs in the market now are

690
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,120
essentially are blowing out this match

691
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,919
in an attempt to extinguish the force

692
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,760
fire. Does that make any sense? Right?

693
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,760
It's not it's not going to work. You

694
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,120
need to do something a lot earlier to

695
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,039
make a difference before the symptoms

696
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,679
have gone so far. We need to stop the

697
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,280
amaloid plaques 10 to 20 years before

698
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,000
the person shows symptoms. And that's

699
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,280
what this drug is called GSM. GSM. Yes.

700
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,159
Yeah. That's that's the idea. So we

701
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,400
would use the GSM in someone who has

702
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,120
high plaque in their brain but no

703
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,360
symptoms with early screening. Right now

704
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,720
it's brain imaging but blood tests are

705
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,559
on the way. So just like you test for

706
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,919
cholesterol, you test for your amaloid.

707
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,200
Bring it down if you have to. That's

708
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,440
going to be the future of ending this

709
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,520
disease. Oh my goodness. So it raises

710
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,000
one other major question. When we come

711
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,919
back, should you get the Alzheimer's DNA

712
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,880
test right now since we have something

713
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:47,760
you might do about it? Stay with us.

714
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:50,159
Very well done.

715
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,559
Dental scams. Six cavities when I was

716
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,840
told I had none. You just don't know who

717
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,080
to trust. All new Oz Undercover. We were

718
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,080
shocked at people being overcharged or

719
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,210
they're being overdiagnosed. That's

720
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,329
coming up Friday on Dr.

721
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,329
[Music]

722
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:12,640
Oz. Should you get the Alzheimer's DNA

723
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,799
test right now? The FDA has approved

724
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,960
direct to consumer genetic testing, but

725
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,840
is it right for you? How many people in

726
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,240
the audience would be interested in

727
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,559
their genetic test for Alzheimer's?

728
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,320
Yeah, it's a lot of folks, but not

729
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,159
everybody. How are you? Hi, what are

730
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,640
your thoughts about this test? Um, I'm

731
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,840
very interested in taking the test um to

732
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,080
see if I'm at risk. So, any concerns,

733
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,159
for example, if we come back positive?

734
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,559
Well, yeah. I see people how they

735
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,600
deteriorate when they are diagnosed and

736
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,000
I just want to know if there's something

737
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,159
I can do um ahead of time to prepare

738
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,440
myself and my family. You're a very

739
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,640
thoughtful woman. This is not the way to

740
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,840
think about it. But I want to take Dr.

741
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,600
Tany through this so you all understand

742
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,039
exactly what these tests are and what we

743
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,960
can do about it. Is that good? Yes. All

744
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,320
right. So, Dr. Tang is going to walk us

745
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,320
through three things everyone needs to

746
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,480
know before taking the Alzheimer's DNA

747
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,360
test. The first is your DNA is not

748
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,960
protected by HIPPA, right? So, it's not

749
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,799
confidential really as much as you might

750
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,480
want it to be. Well, yeah. I mean, the

751
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,960
problem is if with life insurance or

752
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,559
long-term disability, theoretically a

753
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,640
life a insurance company can ask for

754
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,200
your genetic data, even if it's from a

755
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,799
direct to consumer test. And um you

756
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,120
know, that could in the future, we don't

757
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,960
know, that could lead to denial or or or

758
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,799
increased premiums. So, you know, once

759
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,360
that information is out there, it might

760
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,039
go anywhere. Personally, I'd rather

761
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,400
know. You know, I get all the

762
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,240
theoretical issues that's been told to

763
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,600
me in the past, but I want to know

764
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,520
because it's my life I'm talking about,

765
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,200
and if someone else finds out about it,

766
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,200
I'll deal with it then. All right.

767
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,120
Second big issue is that your genes are

768
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
a measure of risk, but this is

769
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,799
important. They're not a diagnosis,

770
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,520
right? So, there are very rare genes we

771
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,440
discovered um that can cause Alzheimer's

772
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,919
for sure at a very early age, but that's

773
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,840
only 1% of cases. In most cases, it's

774
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,720
genes that have common variations in

775
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,039
them that increase your risk, like

776
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,440
ApoE4. that that gene variant increases

777
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,520
risk two to threefold if just one parent

778
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,159
gave it to you. If both parents gave you

779
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,159
one, then your increased risk is 10 to

780
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,640
14fold. But here's the thing, not

781
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,720
everyone is the same. Other genes can

782
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,480
offset the risk. Your lifestyle can

783
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,240
offset the risk. Yeah. So, just again

784
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,360
said if the APOE E4, that's the thing

785
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,120
you were just saying about if it's

786
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,320
positive, which is the test that is

787
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,440
being looked at right now, that's what

788
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,640
you'll get back when you spit into the

789
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,279
tube. It's not a diagnosis. No, it just

790
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,120
says you have increased risk and in some

791
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,480
people it can can create a lot of panic

792
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,159
as you might imagine. But you have to

793
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,840
remember there are about three dozen

794
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,600
other genes that can offset that risk

795
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,080
and your lifestyle can offset that risk.

796
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,120
So APOE4 positive is not a death

797
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,720
sentence. It doesn't mean you're

798
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,919
guaranteed to get the disease. People

799
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,400
need to know that. It means you have to

800
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,760
be more diligent. Early detection, early

801
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,279
intervention, keep track of what's going

802
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,480
on so you can take care of yourself. But

803
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,520
let's address the not what because

804
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,360
whether you have it or not, you got to

805
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,880
be doing these things. But especially if

806
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,159
you have APO4, you got to pay attention.

807
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,120
So Irene is joining us. You did one of

808
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,039
these mailaway DNA tests. Yes, I did.

809
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,480
Are you okay sharing your results or Oh,

810
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,200
absolutely. No, it's fine. It shows that

811
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,480
I have a propensity to get the disease.

812
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,720
So, I'm concerned because my f it's in

813
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,039
the family. My father passed, his three

814
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,440
of his siblings passed on the male line.

815
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,200
I have two brothers still living and my

816
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,120
son. So, I'm concerned for them and

817
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,039
myself. So, again, you got dealt a bad

818
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,640
card, but you're allowed to shuffle the

819
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,480
deck again. Yeah. That's really what

820
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,400
we're doing today. So you want to walk

821
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,279
us through? Sure. Sure. So we like to

822
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,440
call this shield and each letter start

823
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,520
stands for something. S is sleep. Sleep

824
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,200
eight hours. During your deep sleep

825
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,559
after you're dreaming, this is like

826
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,400
mental floss for the brain. It's when

827
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,919
the brain cleans itself out like scrubby

828
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,520
bubbles. So you have to get try to get

829
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,159
eight hours of sleep. Even if it's not

830
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,240
all at once, even naps are good. Handle

831
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,600
stress. Meditation practice. Stress is

832
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,600
bad for the body. It's bad for the

833
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,600
brain. So dealing with your expectations

834
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,760
of others or or meditation practice is

835
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,919
great. I interact with others. You have

836
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,919
to interact. Friends, family, don't stay

837
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,520
home, right? You have to get out there

838
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,120
and talk to people. Your brain loves

839
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,960
that. It's good for the brain. And your

840
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,880
loved ones who had Alzheimer's probably

841
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,159
became isolated. Yes, they did. Right.

842
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,240
In during the course of their illness,

843
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,880
and that just accelerates that I fall

844
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,880
off the cliff then. Um and and the E

845
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,799
stands for exercise. We just had a big

846
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,039
uh uh paper in the journal science

847
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,520
showing exercise induces the birth of

848
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,919
new nerve cells in the brain where

849
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,000
Alzheimer strikes and in mice can

850
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,840
reverse the cognitive problems and it

851
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,440
also gets rid of the inflammation. So

852
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,520
that's a exercise has never been more

853
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,960
important. Learning new things like we

854
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,039
are right now that means you make new

855
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,480
connections in the brain and Alzheimer's

856
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,840
dementia comes from losing those

857
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,600
connections. So the more you make in

858
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,039
advance it's like money in the bank. So

859
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,760
you want to learn as many new things as

860
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,279
you can and finally diet. Nothing's

861
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,399
better than the Mediterranean diet. And

862
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,640
that's that's not just because I'm

863
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,159
Italian, but but but seriously, a

864
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,919
Mediterranean diet that's more

865
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,000
fiberbased, plant-based, nut- based,

866
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,159
less red meat, more fish, or even a

867
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,559
vegetarian source of protein is great

868
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,200
for you because that fiber is what feeds

869
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,880
your bacteria in your gut, your gut

870
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,039
microbiome. And believe me, there may

871
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,559
be, you know, probiotics people take,

872
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,000
but there's nothing better for your gut

873
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,760
microbiome than feeding the ones you

874
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,600
have and keeping them happy with fiber.

875
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,520
When you give them fiber, those bacteria

876
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,320
make chemicals that reduce inflammation

877
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,559
in the brain. You're worried about your

878
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,159
dad, I understand. Yes, I am. Because

879
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,520
when I first realized there was

880
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,840
something wrong, he was watching the

881
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,559
same movie over and over and denying he

882
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,880
saw it and it shocked me to the core.

883
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,120
And I cried. First of all, I know what

884
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
it's like. We all had roses like that.

885
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,240
But when I see something like this up

886
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,760
there, Yeah. stuff that you can begin to

887
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,120
incorporate into his life right now.

888
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,600
Yes. That can give a little extra time

889
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,799
at Dr. Tanzy. That's the power that you

890
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,919
have, right? That's why this show

891
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,880
exists. That's why all the folks

892
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,559
watching right now can make a

893
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,000
difference.

894
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,080
We're going to put a one sheet with the

895
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,399
full shield plan. Shield. Remember that

896
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
the acronym on dr.com. Dr. Tandy, thank

897
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,360
you very much. He's got a fantastic

898
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,880
book. His latest one's called the

899
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,559
healing self. The man's a wonderful

900
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,559
writer. He actually play he's a

901
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,399
musician, right? You going to brag or

902
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,960
should I brag for you? Oh, you can do

903
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,279
it. Aerosmith. Now you think about that.

904
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,090
A true true rock star. I'll be right

905
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,399
back.

906
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,240
[Applause]

907
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,480
Up next, the food investigation. You've

908
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,799
been craving the truth about new protein

909
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,919
pastas at your supermarket. Is pasta

910
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,919
really now a health

911
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,540
[Music]

912
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,540
[Applause]

913
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,720
food. All right. Is protein packed, high

914
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,760
fiber, low carb. What am I talking

915
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,000
about? Vegetables, right? No, not now.

916
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,320
I'm talking about the latest claims

917
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,080
surrounding pasta. New protein pastas

918
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,159
out there make it sound like everyone's

919
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,080
favorite carb could be a health food.

920
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,159
But are they really? Today, a new food

921
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,159
investigation. The truth about the

922
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,679
protein pasta trend showing up in your

923
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,200
supermarket. They're all around the

924
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,360
place. Here to help break it down, food

925
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,080
journalist Mark Scher. Everybody knows

926
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,320
that pasta's been on forever. Public

927
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,880
enemy number one for dieters. Mark says

928
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,480
pasta's everywhere again with these new

929
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,559
noodles. So, are they really the answer

930
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,559
to everyone's pasta prayers? I think

931
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,240
they are an answer. Now, the first thing

932
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,080
I'll say is I think regular pasta can be

933
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,520
part of a healthy diet. Some people

934
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,720
really struggle with carbs. They get

935
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,000
carb cravings. They don't like the way

936
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,200
carbs make them feel. A lot of people

937
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960
have been trying to reduce the amount of

938
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,159
carbs in their diet. Well, the pasta

939
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,080
industry has responded. We've got these

940
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,760
pastas. I would also say though, you got

941
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,360
to use your you got to use your head a

942
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,880
little bit. Eating these pastas is not

943
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,720
permission to have two or three bowls.

944
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,320
It's also not permission to have a

945
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,240
double cheeseburger with extra cheese

946
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,840
for lunch the next day on the side. Be

947
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,760
smart. Yeah, they feel like regular

948
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,120
pasta. They look like regular pasta.

949
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,360
Find out about them. I got some carb

950
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,279
loving pasta fiends over here. They say

951
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,200
they are boiling with questions. Pardon

952
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,240
the pun. Are you ready? Pasta lovers.

953
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,480
Yeah. What do you want to know? We're

954
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,480
going to start off with Nicole. What's

955
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,080
in them? What's actually in those pastas

956
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,840
I was just holding. All right, Maddie,

957
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,000
your question. Is it actually healthy

958
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,320
and low carb? Is it worth it to switch?

959
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,640
Which is my key question to you, Serene?

960
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,080
Ooh, how's it taste? That's That's the

961
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,960
big one for me. How does it handle? All

962
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,320
right, so we're gonna ask you all, but

963
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,279
let's start our investigation. We're

964
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,880
going to start off with Nicole's

965
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,120
question because it's important. What's

966
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,080
actually in these protein pastas? So,

967
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,600
you researched this and how do you take

968
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,600
beans and turn them into bean pasta? How

969
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,440
does that magic happen actually? Well,

970
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,440
and it depends. They're not all the

971
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,600
same. So, sometimes it's just one

972
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,080
ingredient. These beans with water

973
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,120
become these. Other manufacturers start

974
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,120
adding things. They'll add things like

975
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,640
Zantham gum, tapioca. They're trying to

976
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,200
get the texture to be more like regular

977
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,279
pasta. We found one brand that had 15

978
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,279
ingredients. 15. That's always my

979
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,120
hang-up cuz when you make something

980
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,200
synthetically resemble what it comes

981
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,799
with in nature, that's the problem with

982
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,240
gluten-free foods for me. Exactly. Is

983
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,200
this just another example? I think a lot

984
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,640
of consumers are getting a little edge.

985
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,399
You start to get that alchemy. So, but

986
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,080
what I would say people need to do, read

987
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,519
the label. The shorter the ingredient

988
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,799
list, the better. But the number one

989
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,279
thing is if you're buying a black bean

990
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,799
pasta, then black beans should be the

991
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,919
number one ingredient. What I get

992
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,039
worried about is somebody's just going

993
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,399
to start adding a little black bean

994
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,760
powder to a regular pasta and say, "Hey,

995
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,519
it's black bean pasta." So here you have

996
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,120
bean, bean flour, and water. That's

997
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,880
that's like the ultimate. And and the

998
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,159
shorter the better. And there are brands

999
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,600
that just have those. There are brands,

1000
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,039
yeah, that are that simple. That makes

1001
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,640
it easy. You can pronounce all those

1002
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,320
ingredients. Okay. Next question we

1003
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,840
heard is, are they really that much

1004
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,960
healthier? Let's start off with the

1005
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,559
protein element, right? So regular old

1006
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,320
pasta comes in two main forms. here,

1007
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,159
right? The we look at a lot of major

1008
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,919
brands out there to figure out. So, what

1009
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,200
do we find out with regard to protein

1010
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,760
just between regular pasta and whole

1011
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,519
wheat, which is today the standard for

1012
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,240
being healthy. Okay. So, yeah, good old

1013
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,559
regular pasta is six grams of protein

1014
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,679
per cup. Six. Now, things improve a

1015
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,039
little bit with whole wheat pasta. You

1016
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,640
get up to eight grams of protein per

1017
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,120
cup. Well, that's a big difference.

1018
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,720
Yeah, sort of. We'll see. It gets more

1019
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,559
interesting. All right, the quick

1020
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,240
question. Which pasta that we're talking

1021
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,640
about today had the most protein per

1022
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,000
serving? So, it the brands vary, but

1023
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,320
consistently the one that came out on

1024
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,399
top was red lentil pasta. Red lentil 14

1025
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,039
grams. And you like cooking with red

1026
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,399
lentils? Absolutely. Why so? Okay. The

1027
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,240
first thing I like about red lentil

1028
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,840
pasta is that it's made from something

1029
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,600
real. What I'm not into are these things

1030
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,440
where they add like a protein extract

1031
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,360
and and everyone's pretending it's all

1032
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,079
the same. The second thing I like about

1033
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,919
this is the way it tastes. Now, this

1034
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,760
issue about taste is critical. A lot of

1035
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,919
folks say, "Well, does this compare to

1036
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,119
my my friendly neighborhood simolina

1037
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,359
pasta, the traditional one I grew up

1038
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,359
with?" That that's the wrong question.

1039
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,280
The question is, is this good enough by

1040
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,800
itself? And we need to start asking the

1041
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,480
question that way. That way, we stop

1042
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,159
having these false decisions about

1043
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,079
whether it's good enough. Exactly. And

1044
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,679
don't don't pretend it's something that

1045
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,520
it isn't. Embrace it for what it is. All

1046
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,280
right. Next up, a lot of these pastas

1047
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,800
argue that they're high in fiber. Some

1048
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,720
are better than others. What is the best

1049
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,079
in terms of fiber? Best across the board

1050
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,599
is black bean pasta. If you're looking

1051
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,359
for fiber, that is the choice. All

1052
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,599
right. And for years, the the folks who

1053
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,280
were pastic argued that the carbs were a

1054
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,520
problem. Which of these new protein

1055
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,520
pastas is the lowest in actual carbs?

1056
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,639
Yeah, the lowest in carbs is a relative

1057
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,079
new player. Pasta made from green peas

1058
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,079
has 27 gram of carbs per cup. That's

1059
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,839
like half of what you get in regular

1060
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,280
pasta. So, that is a significant

1061
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,119
difference. Yeah. I would thought the

1062
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,720
beans would be lower, but in peas, peas

1063
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,720
we go. All right. Pasta lovers are here.

1064
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,000
They're trying this now. Pastors, before

1065
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,359
you taste, you've heard the whole

1066
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,280
presentation. We've answered all three

1067
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,040
of your questions. High level thoughts,

1068
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,240
but have we changed your in your first

1069
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,359
instincts about protein pastas? Uh, yes.

1070
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,640
I'm curious to try them. Curious enough

1071
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,640
to try. That's a step forward. These

1072
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,640
people are skeptical. The caller makes

1073
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,400
me really nervous that it's bright

1074
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,920
green. Yeah, it is a weird color. But

1075
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,160
you do see that in Italy they make pasta

1076
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,000
with spinach. Yeah. All right, Mark.

1077
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,520

1082
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,800
revealed. Plus, Chef Robé is here with

1083
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,720
the protein pasta cooking hack is so

1084
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,800
darn good, it tastes like eating the

1085
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,119
real thing. There he is working hard.

1086
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,119
Chef

1087
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,160
Robé, I love getting to talk with you on

1088
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,400
my show every single day, but when the

1089
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,720
cameras stop rolling, the conversation

1090
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,640
is not over. I still have a lot that I

1091
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,440
want to talk about. So download the Dr.

1092
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,580
Oz podcast on Apple Podcast or wherever

1093
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,110
you get your

1094
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,110
[Music]

1095
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,920
podcast. If you love your pasta, but you

1096
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,440
stay away from it because of all the

1097
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,359
carbs and calories, well, get ready

1098
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,040
because we have the skinny on the latest

1099
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,720
protein pastas taking over your

1100
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,880
supermarket. We've been investigating

1101
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,960
the truth about these new noodles and

1102
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,800
now the tasty tricks to making these new

1103
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,040
pastas taste like the real thing. And

1104
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,520
who better than chef Robé to teach us

1105
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,680
about this.

1106
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,119
There are so many folks complaining

1107
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,640
whining. We heard our taste testers at

1108
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,079
the bike club earlier speaking about the

1109
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,920
fact they don't like the color, they

1110
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,839
don't like the texture, this and that.

1111
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,320
What's the key to making these new

1112
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,119
proteinrich uh pastas taste like the

1113
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,280
real thing? Well, I personally don't

1114
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,920
mind them at all. You know, I like peas.

1115
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,119
I like uh what was it? Lentils and black

1116
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,520
beans, all these things. So, it doesn't

1117
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,800
bother me at all. Um, what I like to do

1118
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,640
is just pair it with a simple sauce. So,

1119
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,160
um, you know, it's it's fall, so I'm

1120
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,480
thinking, you know, butternut squash,

1121
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,920
right? Oh, it's the best. So, so what I

1122
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,200
did was I made a butternut squash pasta

1123
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,040
sauce. You know, that this is the star

1124
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,280
of the show. Um, so I take butternut

1125
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,920
squash, a little bit of celery, carrots,

1126
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,680
onion, and garlic. Toss it in a bowl

1127
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,960
with some olive oil, salt, pepper, pop

1128
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,400
it in the oven. So, this is basically

1129
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,320
your tomato equivalent cuz it's the

1130
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,760
fall. Well, yeah. Yeah. I mean, tomatoes

1131
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,760
good all year round, but I wanted it to

1132
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,040
be, you know, everybody expects a tomato

1133
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,040
sauce, so, you know, get funky with it,

1134
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,520
right? Get funky with it. Perfect. Okay.

1135
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,359
So, so I roast it all up. Okay. You put

1136
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,280
it in a blender with some veggie stock,

1137
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,280
a little tomato paste, a little either

1138
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,520
raw uh honey, which is my favorite, or

1139
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,599
maple syrup, natural sweetener, right?

1140
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,680
And some goat cheese in a blender. Blend

1141
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,880
it up. Pop it in a pot. It's warm.

1142
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,240
You're done at that point. All right. I

1143
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,240
give you some numbers here. I think look

1144
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,079
that I I love the taste of the pasta

1145
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,359
sauce. I love these pastas anyway. But

1146
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,839
here's what I really love. of the health

1147
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,400
benefits. 211 calories and 40 grams

1148
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,280
normally for your regular old flour

1149
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,040
noodles right for these pea pasta

1150
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,680
various 191 calories 27 gram of carbs

1151
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,800
and you're cutting it by 30 40%. It's a

1152
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,400
big big deal. Absolutely. But I've

1153
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,640
learned after 10 years of making this

1154
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,320
show they don't actually taste my taste

1155
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,680
buds as much as they taste their taste

1156
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,960
buds. Right. So I brought three of our

1157
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,200
harshest critics here who have been

1158
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,880
chowing down. My pasta lovers are back

1159
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,119
for a taste test. All right. Who wants

1160
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,680
to go first? Nicole, you're up first.

1161
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,599
It's really good. It's

1162
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,599
um a good way to get my daughter to eat

1163
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,520
her vegetables. You can't even tell. You

1164
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,079
can't even tell. No. Oh my goodness.

1165
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,560
That's a That's a real tribute, Maddie.

1166
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,079
It's really hearty and filling. Like I

1167
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,920
feel like cuz that was the one thing I

1168
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,520
was concerned about if I would feel as

1169
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,200
full. But I feel like with this you

1170
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,880
wouldn't feel like as bloated and things

1171
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,200
like that after sometimes you eat pasta.

1172
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,200
It's re It's really great. And you get

1173
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,760
the ultimate vote here. A thumbs up or

1174
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,480
thumbs down for Chef Roé's creation. You

1175
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,480
might be up to something here.

1176
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,520
Is that three of three? That's three or

1177
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,720
three. Three of three. And and and if

1178
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,400
you want to get really funky with it,

1179
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,599
you know, when I did it at home, uh I

1180
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,520
put I put a little bit of corn in there.

1181
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,440
I sauteed some mushrooms and I I took

1182
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,200
some smoked salmon and just like cut it

1183
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,240
up and folded it in there and I made a

1184
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,000
lot of people happy. Yeah. The guests

1185
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,440
are still there. Yeah. I I'll make it

1186
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,960
four for four. This is really really

1187
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,359
great. But you got to admit the

1188
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,320
underlying pasta is a superstar. Right.

1189
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,839
A toast Chef Obe. Yeah. All right. Thank

1190
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,200
you. Thanks to all my pasta lovers. You

1191
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,160
can get the recipe for this butternut

1192
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,359
squash bis pea pasta on dr.com. I'll be

1193
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,359
right back. Eat these protein

1194
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,160
pastas. An all new crime investigation.

1195
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,280
How could one surgeon harm so many?

1196
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,840
I take the fifth.

1197
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,729
That's coming up

1198
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,729
[Music]

1199
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,119
tomorrow. Today, breaking nut news. I've

1200
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,520
always celebrated the health benefits of

1201
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,200
walnuts and

1202
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,280
pistachios, almonds, but now there's

1203
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,200
even more reason to indulge. Brand new

1204
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,280
research has found that nuts like these

1205
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,760
may have fewer calories than we thought.

1206
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,359
Here at the scoop, food journalist Mark

1207
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,880
Shazer, how do we finally discover the

1208
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,040
truth about these? I have been bragging

1209
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,880
about them. I personally eat them by

1210
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,200
probably my most common source of

1211
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,560
calories and now I get a discount. Yeah,

1212
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,320
it's really interesting. So, here's what

1213
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,480
happened. Scientists at the Agricultural

1214
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,240
Research Service looked at almonds,

1215
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,680
walnuts, and pistachios. They asked an

1216
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,760
interesting question. How many calories

1217
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,839
are in them? But also, how many calories

1218
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,119
are getting in our bodies? What they

1219
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,040
found, there's actually a lot of

1220
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,480
daylight between these two. That a lot

1221
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,240
of those calories that we eat nuts are

1222
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,599
going right through us. And that's good

1223
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,119
news because a lot of us are trying to

1224
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,400
cut back. Take us through this. Let's

1225
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,480
find out how many calories our favorite

1226
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,960
nuts have. We'll start off with almonds.

1227
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,599
Almonds. So, about 23 almonds in an

1228
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,119
ounce. That's a quick warm-up for me. We

1229
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:02,480
thought that was 160 calories. Turns out

1230
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,960
it's 129. Way less. Yeah. Big, big

1231
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,440
difference. 30 calories less. Yeah.

1232
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,440
Almost 20%. Absolutely. And it gets even

1233
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,480
more interesting. Walnuts. Now, walnuts

1234
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,760
have always been good because they're

1235
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,920
high in omega-3s, but 11 walnuts, 1 oz,

1236
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,599
has 185 calories. There's always this,

1237
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,599
oh my god, they're so high in calories.

1238
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,960
Turns out wrong. 146 calories. 40

1239
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,480
calories up almost. Yeah. So that's

1240
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,480
that. Yeah. It's it's a it's a

1241
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,319
significant difference. And then over

1242
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,640
here with pistachios, not as big of a

1243
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,480
difference. We thought 1 oz had 162.

1244
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,520
Turns out

1245
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,160
154. It's about 5%. Not insignificant.

1246
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,160
5% is still something, you know, worth.

1247
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,680
And it's about 40 pistachios in an

1248
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,119
ounce. Is that right? Yes, exactly. So

1249
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,440
you get, you know, you get give rough

1250
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,119
idea of how much is normal. So why does

1251
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,880
it matter that you're

1252
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,480
showing somewhere between 10 20%

1253
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,079
difference in most of these nuts? Yeah.

1254
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,920
Well, you know, nuts have always been

1255
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,200
confusing because on paper they were

1256
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,720
high in calories. So a lot of people are

1257
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,000
running around saying, "Don't eat nuts.

1258
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,520
Don't eat nuts. Nuts are terrible." A

1259
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,359
lot of people got frightened of nuts.

1260
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,720
They were considered junk food. But then

1261
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,920
other realms of science were giving us

1262
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,920
these interesting signals. People who

1263
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,599
would eat a lot of nuts, they would lose

1264
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,760
weight. It seemed to be part of a

1265
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,280
healthy lifestyle. So what's going on?

1266
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,880
Well, now it seems we have our answer

1267
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,160
that there's actually we're not getting

1268
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,760
all the calories from the nuts that we

1269
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,440
eat. So, does this mean we can eat as

1270
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,640
many nuts as we want? So, here's what I

1271
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,079
would say. If you if you hear a piece of

1272
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,480
nutritional news and your first reaction

1273
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,240
is, "So, you're saying I can eat more?"

1274
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,599
Maybe not the best strategy. But what I

1275
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,040
would say is find a way to incorporate

1276
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,480
nuts into your diet. If you like to

1277
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,319
snack on potato chips in front of the

1278
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,359
football game, have nuts instead. If

1279
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,640
you're a little peckish an hour and a

1280
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,000
half after dinner, just grab a little

1281
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,200
handful of nuts. They're satisfying,

1282
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,640
they're delicious, and they're way

1283
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,920
better than we thought. It's brings so

1284
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,440
much more clarity to my mind. Mark,

1285
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,440
thank you as always. Everybody remember

1286
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,470
change is happening. Our journey is just

1287
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,130
beginning.

1288
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:50,130
[Applause]

1289
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,360
[Music]

1290
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,360
[Applause]
