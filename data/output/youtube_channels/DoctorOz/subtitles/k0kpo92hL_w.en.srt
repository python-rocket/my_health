00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,480
Today, a story so tragic that it made me

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,200
take a second look. This man beat his

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,000
mother to death with a hammer. There's

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,839
no dispute about that. The question is

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,240
why? He says a fog of allergy medicine

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,000
made him do it. We're going inside your

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,800
medicine cabinet and we're asking, can

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,560
allergy medicine make you kill? And the

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,480
killer sister is here. What she says

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,720
about the case may surprise you. But

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,000
first, crime correspondent Melissa Moore

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,480
has the story. It was an attack so

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,360
brutal that prosecutors decided not to

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,000
show autopsy photos. The victim had a

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,280
crushed skull and crushed facial bones

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,680
in numerous places. 26-year-old David

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,920
McGee bludgeoned his mother to death.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,320
Crime scene investigators looked at the

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,719
apartment and discovered a bloody hammer

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,039
next to the bed and blood spatter all

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,800
over the wall. At the trial, McGee's

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,359
lawyer said the killing happened in a

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,199
quote fog of benadryil. She claimed

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,199
David was completely under the influence

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,400
of the allergy medication when he

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,960
committed the horrific crime. But a jury

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,200
of his peers were not swayed. After less

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,400
than a day of deliberations, David was

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,360
found guilty of firstdegree murder. Now,

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,920
two questions remain. Why did he do it?

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,920
And is allergy medication to blame for a

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,799
crime that completely devastated a

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,799
family?

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
Melissa Moore joins us. So, what stood

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,159
out the most to you about this case?

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,079
Well, there's two things that stood out

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,159
to me. First, just watching the trial,

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,840
it was absolutely heartbreaking, but

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,320
also the fact that these common everyday

40
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,240
medications that we use could be used as

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,400
a defense for murder. Like, we we

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,079
covered, you know, cold medicine, that

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,000
was a defense. We covered eye drops,

44
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,520
that was a defense. And now it's

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,040
benadryil. David stories is is a strange

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,720
one. What's his relationship with his

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
mother like? Well, it's it's really

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,640
unique. This is a family that they live

49
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,560
together. The son was 26. He was living

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
in a one-bedroom apartment with his

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,880
mother. He he had a close relationship

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,040
with her, but it sound like there was

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,039
some contention from what we heard in

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,160
the courtroom is that the mother was

55
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,760
badgering him to get a job. And do you

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,920
know if he had any mental health issues,

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
anything prior to this murder that might

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,520
explain why he did it? Yeah, he was

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,480
living at home because he had an

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,200
unexpected stroke at the age of 14. He

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,879
at 14 at 14. And so this really hurt the

62
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,239
family, but also caused them to grow get

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,840
closer together because they thought

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
they were going to lose him, that he was

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
going to die. And so they they rallied

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,840
together to save his life. But this

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,280
ultimately impacted his life forever. He

68
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,760
was never the same ever since. He

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,760
suffered from depression. He he didn't

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,840
finish his high school. And so this

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,239
ultimately, you know, really caused him

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,160
to have a lesser quality of life. this

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,879
issue of the fog of benadryil, which is

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,560
what David's attorney uses a defense.

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,080
Had it ever been used before? Where did

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,000
the idea come from? Had you ever heard

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,160
of this? No, I've never I've never heard

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,480
of it in this sense and it's it's never

79
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,400
been the cause for murder. And I know

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,239
for myself when I take benadryil, like

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,720
it knocks me out. Like it's actually

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
more like a sleeping pill for me. But

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,640
for him, I think it had different

84
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,879
consequences. So David was ultimately

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,080
found guilty of firstdegree murder and

86
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,720
sentenced to 26 years to life. So the

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,480
scene in the courtroom was very unusual

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,560
after the case, after the verdict. What

89
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,640
did the judge allow that's so unusual?

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,040
What's unusual is that he allowed the

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,720
family members to come in. The maternal

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,440
grandmother came and hugged him. The

93
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,200
sister came in and was with him. And

94
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,920
this is not a normal procedure. That's

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,080
right. So So the mother of the dead

96
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,560
woman Mhm. and the daughter of a dead

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,640
woman both hugged the murderer. Correct.

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
And that's unusual for a judge to allow

99
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,040
that. But also, he actually wrote a

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,519
suicide note. Oh, he did. He did. He

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,159
wrote a suicide note and saying that the

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,480
reason he killed his mother first was

103
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,720
that she wouldn't witness or live with

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,640
his death. So, he argued that I'll kill

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,879
you first, then I'll kill myself.

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,200
Correct. So, up next, the science behind

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,040
whether allergy medicine can be used as

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,439
a deadly weapon. What really happened

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,360
that day?

110
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,760
We're back taking a forensic look at the

111
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,760
death of Rebecca Apodaka whose son was

112
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,920
convicted of bludgeoning her to death

113
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,680
with a hammer. Now he says he committed

114
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,560
the horrific crime because he was under

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,320
a fog of an allergy medicine. Uh team

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,919
forensic criminologist Dr. Laura Petler

117
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,600
is here in the crime lab. So the

118
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,320
toxicology report says that David

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,240
ingested between 80 and 100 of these

120
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,080
right allergy pills at 25 milligrams a a

121
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,360
pill. Now, just to give you an idea,

122
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,600
right, that's abuse of a

123
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,040
medication. That is a lot of pills to

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
take. And that's what he says he took

125
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
the night that he murdered his mother.

126
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,759
The label, by the way, if you look at

127
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,720
it, it says take one to two tablets

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,560
every 4 to 6 hours. If you take 80 or

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
more pills in a 24-hour period, you are

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
more likely to overdose than to kill

131
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,479
somebody else. So, we don't actually

132
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,400
know what caused David to kill his

133
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,080
mother with a hammer, but the autopsy

134
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,440
report does give us some clues, but at

135
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,120
least you know what's going on in David

136
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,840
when this all took place. So, Laura,

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,280
tell us about the where. So, the where,

138
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,520
we were going to use this dollhouse to

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,360
explain what happened in this case. The

140
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,520
victim appears to have been ambushed

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,759
from behind because the autopsy report

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,600
shows that she had some wounds to the

143
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,320
back of her leg, some bruises, and also

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,960
to the to the her arms. Then the victim

145
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,360
ends up somehow over here on the bed.

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,560
The hammer of course was found near her

147
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,919
body on the nightstand, but her her

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,639
injuries, Dr. Oz, are cranial facial. So

149
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,080
that means that most of the attack was

150
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,240
actually just face on head on right to

151
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,479
the top in in front of her head.

152
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,120
Typically with faceown victims, we find

153
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,880
those in angerbased crime scenes. Now

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,400
let's talk about how she was attacked.

155
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,400
This is important. The autopsy reports

156
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,560
say the small bits of bone and brain

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,960
fragments were found on the bed and the

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,800
floor along with blood spatter on the

159
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,840
walls and the ceilings. Yes. Can you

160
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,000
just show me how that would have

161
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,800
happened? So, as far as the small

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,120
fragments of bone, she has subacoid

163
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,319
hemorrhaging, which is about six layers

164
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,720
down into through past the skull, past

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,880
all of the other membranes there. So,

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,960
those those bones break into a million

167
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,520
pieces and just shatter. So, that's why

168
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,280
you have it on the floor. Yes. And then

169
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
we're going to do this demonstration.

170
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
It's going to kind of explain a little

171
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,960
bit. Now, you're going to have to be

172
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,639
careful because Oh, look at this. This

173
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,720
is service, isn't it? I was trying to be

174
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,800
your scrub nurse here. Yes, I appreciate

175
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,120
that. Okay, so we're going to

176
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,000
demonstrate that how blood spatters.

177
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,360
Blood has a specific viscosity and this

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,319
blood is viscosity that it's similar to

179
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,280
milk. So, here's what I'm going to

180
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,360
do. Going to put a little bit of blood.

181
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,960
And this is not real blood, by the way.

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,680
Fake. And then when force is applied to

183
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,520
blood, especially in a beating death or

184
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,000
in a stabbing death, this is kind of

185
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,280
what happens. I have to open this up

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,639
just a little

187
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,840
bit. I'm going to apply force to this

188
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,680
blood and it's going to spatter.

189
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,560
Or if I change the direction of my hand

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,120
this way, it spatters that way. So in

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,680
order to have spatter, you have to have

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,160
an injury. the blood pulls into the

193
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,400
injury first and then when the weapon

194
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,880
like this I'm gonna take this glove off

195
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,599
when the weapon specifically a hammer is

196
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,759
used in this particular

197
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:32,000
case when when it's applied to the same

198
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,000
area that it was that created the injury

199
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,160
first you get what we have here in the

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,199
demonstration in the box now David where

201
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,919
did they find him David so David the

202
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,160
convicted son he is found in the closet

203
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,240
so fascinating because he could have

204
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,479
gone anywhere in this house But what he

205
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,120
does, he stays in the closet. We know

206
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,919
that he had tried to commit suicide. He

207
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,800
slit his wrist and things. But so he

208
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,879
followed through in the letter that

209
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,960
Melissa mentioned. Yes, he did slit his

210
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,000
wrist and he did slit his throat and

211
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,440
then he did take pills after he murdered

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,199
his mother. So what? Put this all

213
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,680
together for us. We we know he took the

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,280
benadryil. Were his acts intentional or

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,840
were they under the fog of some allergy

216
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,479
medication? The the in this particular

217
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,240
case, we have all of the cranial facial

218
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,560
injuries. That's the listed cause of

219
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,800
death on the autopsy report. So, it's a

220
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,840
purposeful location. He's not beating

221
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,000
her big toe with a hammer. He's beating

222
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,160
her cranial facially. So, it's a

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
deliberate intentional act. All right.

224
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,840
We cannot ignore the fact that David

225
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,519
allegedly had an unexplained stroke as a

226
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,680
teenager. That's unusual. We try to get

227
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,120
the medical reports. We were unable to.

228
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,120
So, I can't confirm that, but it was

229
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,880
discussed at the at in the in the court

230
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,399
proceedings. There can be cognitive

231
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,959
changes after stroke. That's true. You

232
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,160
can have problems solving challenging

233
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,680
issues. You can have difficulty

234
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,959
understanding concepts. We know some of

235
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,560
the common side effects of allergy

236
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,000
medications. You mentioned Melissa

237
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,600
drowsiness. That's the most common one.

238
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,160
That's why people take them. Fatigue,

239
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,480
dizziness, constipation. Right. Yeah.

240
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,279
But not murder. Murder is not a side

241
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,279
effect of an allergy medication. So,

242
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,440
what prompted David to do this in your

243
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,279
opinion, Laura? You know, it's hard to

244
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,360
say exactly, but we know that he did

245
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,279
have some cognitive deficiencies due to

246
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
the stroke. Uh, typically with an

247
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,240
anger-based killing like what we see in

248
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,600
this situation, it it's some event that

249
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,959
triggers the offender to attack.

250
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,880
Remember, David claims he was going to

251
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,959
kill himself first, but then decided to

252
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,959
kill his mother so she wouldn't have to

253
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,560
live with his suicide. So, up next,

254
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,080
David's sister's here. She's going to

255
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,000
speak out about that and what she says

256
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,240
you don't know about this case and why

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,240
she forgives her brother for killing

258
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,160
their mother. We're back investigating

259
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,240
if over-the-counter allergy medicine

260
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,320
could have led a son to bludgeon his

261
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
mother to death. David McKe says he was

262
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,360
under the influence of allergy medicine.

263
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,120
His sister Ella joins us now. When did

264
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,040
you first realize there was a problem

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,839
with your mom? My mother was supposed to

266
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,680
go to dinner with my grandmother and um

267
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,080
one of her friends. So when my

268
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,839
grandmother called me and said, "Hey, I

269
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,600
can't get a hold of your mom." And so I

270
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,680
decided just to go over to her house.

271
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,959
So, you go into the house and what do

272
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,279
you see? I saw my mother laying on her

273
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:16,399
bed face

274
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:20,760
down and it literally looked as though

275
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,760
she was just sleeping.

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,880
But she wasn't. No. I went over to her

277
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,200
and I was like I I touched her shoulder

278
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040
and I was like, "Hey, mom. You you

279
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,600
forgot to pick up grandma. Aren't you

280
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,519
going to dinner with Meline and Grandma?

281
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,320
And I the second I I touched her

282
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,959
shoulder, I realized that something was

283
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,000
not

284
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,680
okay cuz she was

285
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,640
uh she was not the right temperature

286
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,640
that a person should be.

287
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,320
I know this is hard and I and I'm sorry

288
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,760
that you had to go through that.

289
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,399
It's something that you um you always

290
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,200
think happens to other people until you

291
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,480
realize that to other people you are

292
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,440
other people and it anything can happen

293
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,399
to anyone

294
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:19,440
and it's just it's it's awful.

295
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,760
Your brother, was he quiet? Did you did

296
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,079
you hear him? How did you find him? I

297
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,440
didn't know that he was there at first

298
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:31,120
because I didn't see him. But um I found

299
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,640
my brother in the closet and the first

300
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,160
thing that I thought at that point was

301
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,959
that someone had come in and hurt my mom

302
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,959
and that my brother was hiding. Were you

303
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,320
scared at this point? Cuz you you didn't

304
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,959
know what had happened to your mom, the

305
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,240
the perpetrator could be anywhere. And

306
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,279
if it was your brother, did it ever

307
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,880
cross your mind that it could be your

308
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,600
brother? No, it

309
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,920
didn't. The like I said I thought he was

310
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
if he was hiding I the only thing that I

311
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,680
thought was that he was scared of

312
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,279
someone else. There was no point in

313
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,399
which I was afraid of my brother or

314
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,880
thought that he could have done

315
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,279
something. Had your brother ever

316
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,920
demonstrated signs of mental illness? My

317
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,079
brother had had a stroke when he was 14

318
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,680
years old. But um afterwards

319
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,440
he a lot of people I guess with life and

320
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,680
death experiences like that they either

321
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,200
go one way like where they embrace life

322
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,279
to the fullest or they get really

323
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,560
depressed and reclusive and my brother

324
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,800
was one of the people that got really

325
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,360
depressed and reclusive. Was there ever

326
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,800
a moment as he was suffering through the

327
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,240
depression and whatever damage happened

328
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,639
because of the stroke where you thought

329
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,800
he might be a danger to himself to you

330
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:42,320
to your mother?

331
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,639
Never a point. I mean, I I thought I

332
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,720
thought

333
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:48,920
maybe at a certain point that he was in

334
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,839
danger of hurting

335
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:56,320
himself, but that point passed and he

336
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,839
gained like he went back to school, he

337
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,120
gained friends outside of of that. He

338
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,440
got a job and everything. And so I I

339
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,839
didn't really worry about that as much,

340
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,079
but obviously I should have.

341
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,079
Well, should have is a very dangerous

342
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,480
combination of words. You're right. This

343
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,320
defense of being in the fog of an

344
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,760
allergy

345
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,399
medicine. Do you think as a sister that

346
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,279
was what happened that evening? I

347
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:31,680
do. I know

348
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:33,839
that benadryil is the same thing as a

349
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,880
sleeping pill. And my brother had taken

350
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,560
so many of them. Like I'm amazed that

351
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm amazed that he could function even.

352
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,440
So the fact that something awful

353
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,360
happened, I absolutely believe

354
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,200
that if he had not been under that

355
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,079
influence that he would have been able

356
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:59,360
to control himself or not have had that

357
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,120
happen. It was preventable.

358
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,920
You forgiven him for killing your

359
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,560
mother. I have forgiven him. I love my

360
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,320
brother. He will always be my brother. I

361
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,800
feel very strongly that just because

362
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,199
someone does a bad thing does not make

363
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,480
them a bad

364
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:18,000
person. But I forgive my brother because

365
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,519
he will always be my brother.

366
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,959
I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. It's okay.

367
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,680
What has he told you about how he

368
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:30,199
feels about what happened?

369
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,680
He feels such immense

370
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:37,519
guilt and that

371
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,720
he he regrets absolutely everything that

372
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:45,279
led up to what

373
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:48,000
happened and that he wishes that he and

374
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,760
this hurts me so much, but he wishes

375
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,079
that he had just followed through with

376
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,519
killing himself

377
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:56,519
first so that I would still have my

378
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,279
mom

379
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,240
and he wishes that he could undo it. And

380
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,000
now he wishes that eventually he can get

381
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
out of prison to try and start doing

382
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,199
something to write some of the wrong

383
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,600
that that he did. How do you want all of

384
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,440
us to remember your mom?

385
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,120
My mom was the coolest person ever. She

386
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,240
was my best friend. She

387
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:25,199
um was immensely into music.

388
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,600
And when I was about 11 years old, we

389
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:31,480
started going to concerts together. She

390
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:35,279
was an amazing friend to me, to her best

391
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:38,079
friend, to my grandparents, to everyone

392
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,240
that she met. Everyone liked my mom. You

393
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:44,320
You hear people say that a lot, but

394
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,519
everyone did like my mom. And I want her

395
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,040
to be remembered as someone who cared so

396
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,680
deeply about other people and wanted to

397
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,120
make the world a better place. Well, I

398
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,279
want to remember her for raising a

399
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:02,320
wonderful young woman. Thank you.

400
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,759
I wish you the best of luck. Thank you.
