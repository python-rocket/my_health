1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,279
Dental scams. Six cavities when I was

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,400
told I had none. You just don't know who

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,639
to trust. Oz undercover. We were shocked

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,320
at people being overcharged. I was in

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,320
the chair for less than 10 minutes when

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,600
she started finding problems. The total

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,720
cost $3,500.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,039
Plus an Oz medical mystery. The boy who

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,600
was slowly turning to stone. He's going

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,600
to be in tuned within himself. Coming up

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,600
next.

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,980
[Music]

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,520
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,559
I love you guys.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,280
Today, an undercover investigation that

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,960
might make you angry. In a group

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
brainstorm, it came up that several

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,920
members of my staff felt they had been

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,640
scammed at the dentist. So, we looked

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,799
online at Yelp reviews, which you I know

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,560
many of you use to pick a doctor, and we

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,040
were shocked at the claims of people

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
being overcharged or that something

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,840
shocked me even more was that they were

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,159
being overdiagnosed.

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
So we went undercover to see are

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,119
negative reviews a good indicator of a

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,520
bad doctor. When we asked correspondent

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,080
Maras Gavakmpo to investigate, she had a

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,439
story of her own in a story that sort of

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,000
stunned me. So I want you to hear that

32
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,280
and we'll get into the investigation. So

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
what happened to you? You hadn't been to

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,880
a dentist in two years. Yeah, I'm not

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
the biggest fan of the dentist. What

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,600
happened two years ago? Uh well, I went

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,119
to the dentist. It was for a regular

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,040
dental checkup. Nothing was bothering

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,640
me. Um and the dentist said that I had a

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
crack in a filling that needed to be

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,399
repaired. So, I took their word for it.

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,240
I made a follow-up appointment. I went

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,399
back. I got the work done. I remember

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,960
the needle for numbing was incredibly

45
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,320
painful. Um, but I got that procedure

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,320
done. So, you were so entranced by this

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,079
idea that not everyone was being as

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,920
professional as they could be that you

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,680
agreed to help us infiltrate behind

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040
lines. Yeah. To figure out what's really

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,640
happening. And you look at these online

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,840
reviews. Yes. So, how'd you organize it?

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,280
How did you begin to set it up? Well,

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,800
the first thing we did was get a

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,480
baseline because remember I hadn't been

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
to the dentist in two years. So, we went

57
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,879
to a dentist, Dr. Rashbomb, and he gave

58
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,120
me a thorough exam to let me know the

59
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,760
current condition of my teeth. In the

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
meantime, our team was combing Yelp

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,959
reviews, looking for people who were

62
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
complaining about their dentist, and we

63
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,640
were shocked to find how many people had

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,920
complaints. So, we actually followed up

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,760
with some people. We did our due

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,280
diligence, and then we made appointments

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,040
at some of the places that seemed like

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,959
the worst offenders. Let's take a look

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,760
at how the investigation unfolded.

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,959
Dentists. Are some taking an unnecessary

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,120
bite out of your wallet? To find out,

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,840
we're going to go undercover visiting

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,319
several dentists with these glasses and

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,480
a hidden camera.

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,040
Yeah.

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,440
I told the same story to each dentist,

77
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
and it's true. So, I just wanted a a

78
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,400
general checkup to see if there was

79
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,560
anything pressing that needs to be

80
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,879
addressed. Um, because I haven't been to

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,319
the dentist in a few years. I was

82
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,080
shocked by their

83
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,239
findings because just one week before

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,720
I'd gotten a baseline checkup from New

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,360
York City dentist Dr. Justin Rashbound

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,200
and he told me, "Overall, your teeth

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,239
look like they're in great shape."

88
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right, great. No cavities. Dr.

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,319
Rashbound did a thorough tooth and

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,239
perodontal exam and took a complete set

91
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,000
of X-rays to determine the health of my

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
teeth. What are some things that you saw

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,879
that might need to be addressed? What

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
are some things that you might expect

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,080
another dentist to say you should

96
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,920
address this now? Well, I think one of

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,720
the I think uh another dentist will

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,480
probably see or should see uh that you

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,400
have a filling that needs to be replaced

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,239
uh on your bottom left. So, just to be

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,319
clear, you think I need the filling

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
addressed and I need a teeth cleaning.

103
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,080
That's it. Nothing else. That's it.

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,239
Armed with this assessment from a

105
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,599
trusted dentist, I was ready to go

106
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,760
undercover. After being rigged with a

107
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,840
hidden camera, I headed out to three New

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,080
York City dentists with some bad online

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,640
reviews to see if any would prescribe

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,640
unnecessary work and try to overcharge

111
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,239
me.

112
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,400
And everyone watching, this is not about

113
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,239
bashing dentists. Most are honest and

114
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,079
reputable. So, I've invited a team of

115
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,639
dentists here to weigh in on what you're

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,440
about to see. Dr. Justin Rashbam, that's

117
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,199
who met before the uh the investigation.

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,960
She wanted to get a baseline. My

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,520
personal dentist joins us, Dr. David

120
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Jyn. and Dr. Adah Cooper, a practicing

121
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
dentist and spokesperson for the

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,800
American Dental Association. And they're

123
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,560
here to help you pick the best dentist

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
to make sure you get the best treatment.

125
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,639
All right, so now Mara had a good idea

126
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,560
of the condition of her teeth. But to be

127
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,240
sure of the diagnosis, we had her x-rays

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,919
examined by an additional dentist for

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,280
confirmation. So up next, our

130
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,240
investigation continues. You will not

131
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,639
believe what happened undercover at

132
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,680
various dentists with bad reviews across

133
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,680
New York City. Stay with us.

134
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,759
All new. For years, we've been told to

135
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
eat less carbs and more protein. New

136
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
research shows that those steaks,

137
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,960
burgers, the bacon could be the secret

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,840
culprit behind your biggest health

139
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,240
issue. Meat belly dilemma. When you eat

140
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,320
this kind of diet, bad bacteria can

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
overpop populate. Plus, shocking

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,080
information that you never knew about

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,160
seafood. 90% of our seafood is

144
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,320
important, and the FDA only takes a look

145
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,720
at 3% or less. All new OS that's coming

146
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,720
up on

147
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,880
[Music]

148
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,440
Monday. I'm back with Marcompo who went

149
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,360
undercover to dentists with negative

150
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,000
online reviews to see if they'd really

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,320
overcharge or even overdiagnose issues

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,360
with her teeth. My panel dentist is also

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,880
back. We're going to check with them in

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,960
a little bit. But before going

155
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,600
undercover, Mara got a complete dental

156
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,199
checkup, a baseline for comparison. So

157
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,039
before we see the the results of your

158
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
investigation, this really got me. How

159
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,560
did you figure out which dentist to see

160
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,039
and how many did you have in mind to go

161
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,720
visit? Yeah. So we based this on Yelp

162
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,680
reviews and we picked seven of what we

163
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
thought were probably the worst

164
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,759
offenders based on the reviews. We only

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
made it through three of them because we

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,840
were so shocked by we found by what we

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,360
found with the first three. And for

168
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,280
those three consultations, we spent

169
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,520
$450. But we didn't even have to go to

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
all seven just for the visits. 450

171
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,120
bucks. Yeah. Just for the visits. No

172
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,880
cleanings, no anything else. So remember

173
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,919
what these dentists were told when the

174
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,000
appointments were made. They were told

175
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,479
that Mer had not seen a dentist in two

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,759
years just wanted an assessment would

177
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,360
pay out of pocket. Those are the

178
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,199
baselines. So what happens next in our

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,479
investigation? Well, it surprised us

180
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,840
all. Take a look. The first dentist I

181
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,160
visited undercover really surprised me.

182
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,919
The only cavities I see are are the top

183
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,400
wisdom teeth. In the middle of the

184
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,560
teeth, you have these little cavities. I

185
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,160
have cavities in my wisdom teeth. Yeah.

186
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,479
Look, I I can show you what they look

187
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
like. Okay. I I'm going to trust your

188
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,960
judgment, but you fairly certain that

189
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,479
that's the case. Very certain. Okay.

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,560
With uh with 100% certainty? Yeah. And

191
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,199
the cost to fill those two cavities

192
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
along with a mouth guard he recommended.

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,759
So, your total for the full guard

194
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,759
fillings comes out to $1,150.

195
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,039
$1,150. Just getting out of that visit

196
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,280
and I am shocked. Two cavities. Let's

197
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,160
see what the next dentist will find.

198
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,639
There are three things that are going

199
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,120
on. Um, one thing, two that had a root

200
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,120
canal that would need a crown to protect

201
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,880
it so it doesn't break on this side.

202
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
Yeah. Then on the other side, there's a

203
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,720
filling from DK going on underneath that

204
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
filling. And then there's one more

205
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,280
filling, which is a regular filling on

206
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,759
the top here that needs to be replaced.

207
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,599
The total cost $3,500.

208
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
So, apparently I need two replacement

209
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,360
fillings and one new crown. But hey, at

210
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,520
least no cavities. Let's see what the

211
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,280
next one says. I was in the chair for

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,400
less than 10 minutes when she started

213
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:04,879
finding problems. She has a MO on 30 and

214
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,360
an acclusal on 32. You also do have some

215
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,280
cavities on your wisdom teeth. The teeth

216
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,360
all the way in the back. On the top or

217
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,840
the bottom? On all four of them. I have

218
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,680
four cavities. Mhm. Actually, five.

219
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,400
Actually, it wasn't five. It ended up

220
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,280
being six cavities. The total cost to

221
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,280
repair them,

222
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,199
$1,930. I'm just shocked. I mean, six

223
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,159
cavities when I was told I had none. You

224
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,599
just don't know who to trust.

225
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,200
Yeah. Looking at the audience, they're

226
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,039
shaking their heads. More importantly to

227
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,719
me, the dentists, colleagues, the panel

228
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,519
are shaking their heads. So, let's take

229
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,440
let's go to you guys from zero cavities.

230
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,519
Dr. Rash, that was your professional

231
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,200
opinion. What's your reaction to the

232
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,440
dentist finding things that you didn't

233
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,920
see or were they not there? I'm not here

234
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,160
to say that my exam was the right one

235
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,959
and everyone else's was incorrect. But

236
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,800
it's not only necessarily uh if a

237
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,480
filling needs to be treated, but also

238
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,080
when a filling needs to be treated.

239
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,000
There are certain fillings that Mara had

240
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
that were not the most beautiful looking

241
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
restorations I've ever seen. So, simply

242
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,279
just replacing fillings. Just because

243
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,440
something doesn't look aesthetically

244
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,440
perfect doesn't necessarily mean that's

245
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
the correct treatment. And I tend to be

246
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,600
a little bit more conservative and in in

247
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,880
that instance I recommend to just that

248
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,360
one. I think everything else will hold

249
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,880
up for quite a long time. So Dr. J, this

250
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,640
is a judgment issue. I go to you. I

251
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,320
trust you because you are conservative.

252
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,600
Thank you. And I value that. You know,

253
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,279
you're thoughtful. You point stuff out,

254
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,000
but you do the least you can. So how do

255
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,200
you go if you're a consumer from being

256
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,440
told you need maybe one filling or no

257
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,600
actual real bad cavities to maybe having

258
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,920
six things having to be addressed? Well,

259
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,959
you really got to get to know your

260
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,080
patient first. You can't just on day one

261
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,399
say you need A, B, C, D, and E. Our our

262
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,760
job is to promote longevity of tooth,

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,040
not to just drill and fill them. Dr.

264
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,959
Cooper, you represent the American

265
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,800
Dental Association, which of course is

266
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,399
robustly full of wonderful ethical

267
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,839
people. Absolutely. But the profession

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
must get concerned when you see this

269
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,240
kind of variability as well. again from

270
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,480
zero to six or a big number difference

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,320
between one exam that we trust and

272
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,680
another exam that we just heard. Yeah.

273
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,760
Let me say first of all that you're

274
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,279
right. Most dentists are really

275
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,000
hardworking, impeccably honest, and have

276
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,760
devoted years and years of training to

277
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
making sure that they're doing what's

278
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,399
absolutely best in your best interest.

279
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In making that

280
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,120
determination, you're both right. There

281
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,640
is a range within which most dentists

282
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,279
work to determine what the best

283
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,560
treatment is based on you and your needs

284
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,519
and your history. Okay? So for example,

285
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,200
at one end of the range are dentists who

286
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,480
tend to be more conservative in their

287
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,600
treatment. There are other dentists who

288
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,680
are a little bit more proactive. Okay?

289
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,360
So, make sure that if one dentist has

290
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,040
told you something and another has told

291
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,399
you something else that you don't just

292
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,480
assume that both of them are being

293
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
dishonest with you. It may just be that

294
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,399
they're practicing along that spectrum

295
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,000
of different philosophies. But, you

296
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,760
know, the heartbreaking thing to me, the

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,760
most heartbreaking thing to me about

298
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,279
watching that video is the look of utter

299
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,519
confusion on your face. No dentist wants

300
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,920
a patient to be that confused. Most

301
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,000
dentists really want you to understand

302
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,920
what's going on. Really want you to

303
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,519
understand what we're saying to you. And

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,120
so if you're feeling confused because

305
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
you've gotten different opinions because

306
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,200
you're not understanding what the

307
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,200
dentist is saying, ask the questions

308
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,839
because it puts the power back in your

309
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,959
lab to make good decisions for you. Ask

310
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,279
to see X-rays. Ask to see pictures. Ask

311
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,800
if there are any alternative treatments.

312
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,560
You can ask for priorities. When

313
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,720
patients come into my office, I always

314
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,440
give a list of priorities. This is what

315
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,959
you can do to make your teeth stronger.

316
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,279
And these are optional things to make

317
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,200
your teeth prettier. If you ask for that

318
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,519
list of priorities, if you ask the

319
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,399
questions that you have nine times out

320
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,000
of 10, because dentists really do care

321
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,760
about you and your oral health, you'll

322
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
leave without the confusion. All right.

323
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,120
So, what about the 10th time? What if

324
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,720
you're not satisfied by what by what

325
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,040
you've learned? Then leave and find a

326
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,720
dentist that you trust. So, up next, how

327
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,480
to pick the best doctor and avoid

328
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,220
getting treatment you don't need. Stay

329
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,920
with us.

[Music]

331
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,000
For 32 years, this 12-year-old's death

332
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,800
has remained a mystery until now. Using

333
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,399
genealogy and cuttingedge DNA technology

334
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:32,440
to create her suspected killer's face.

335
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,440
That's coming up on Tuesday.

336
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm back with correspondent Mars

337
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,160
Gavakmpa who went undercover to dentists

338
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,240
with bad online reviews to see if she'd

339
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,959
been overcharged or overdiagnosed. And

340
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
what we found, well, it shocked us both.

341
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,399
We're joined by a panel of dentists who

342
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,839
want to make sure you get the best care,

343
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,160
including the dentists who did Mara's

344
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,480
initial assessment, Dr. Justin Rushbomb.

345
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,160
So, I got my personal dentist, Dr. David

346
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,839
Jyn, is here and Dr. Adah Cooper, a

347
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,680
practicing dentist and spokesperson for

348
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,800
the American Dental Association. All

349
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,399
right. So, let's look again at the

350
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,320
diagnosis from the second dentist,

351
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,200
Marasaw.

352
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,680
There are three things that are going

353
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,160
on. Um, one thing, two, that had a root

354
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,160
canal that would need a crown to protect

355
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
it so it doesn't break on this side.

356
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,839
Yeah. Then on the other side, there's a

357
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,240
filling on decay going on underneath

358
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,920
that. And then there's one more filling,

359
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,770
which is a regular filling on the top

360
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,880
here that needs to be replaced.

$3,500 worth of work and four visits.

363
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
So, Dr. Jin, how do you explain the

364
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,440
different diagnosis and the different

365
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,160
costs that were brought in in these

366
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,880
different dentists? Well, the exact fee

367
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,720
structure that each dentist charges, it

368
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,839
it really depends on them. Like for

369
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,120
instance, if you have a medical

370
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,320
condition, when you go from one hospital

371
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,760
to the next, the fees uh varies greatly.

372
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,240
On the other hand, in terms of

373
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,600
diagnosis, it's our job to actually

374
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,760
explain to you what is arrested, what is

375
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,040
what is active, what is urgent, what is

376
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,440
not. So many folks watching now are

377
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,720
going to be confused because they see a

378
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,639
whole slew of options and it's not

379
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,160
always that clear, I think, which ones

380
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,920
are important. You certainly didn't have

381
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,959
that belief. It wasn't clear to me. No.

382
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,240
So, let's just take this one by one.

383
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,240
First of all, we don't have a lot of

384
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,240
transparency in medicine or in dentistry

385
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,440
on costs, which is a big big problem in

386
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,880
this country. But there's one place you

387
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,320
can look in healthcare. It's called the

388
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,440
blue book, right? The healthcare blue

389
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
book will give you an estimate of the

390
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,000
costs in your area. And I'm going to put

391
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,160
a link to it on my website. So, at least

392
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,839
start with that so you have a a way of

393
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,480
beginning to enter the discussion of

394
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,760
what things are cost. How do you

395
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,279
actually know if you're being taken

396
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,160
advantage of? And I'll open it up to all

397
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,600
of you because there's no way that every

398
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,959
single dentist is perfect. And just

399
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,480
looking at these Yelp reviews, there are

400
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,680
plenty of great Yelp reviews or dentists

401
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,880
in New York City. I don't know why

402
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,720
people would go to these dentists with

403
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,399
bad Yelp reviews, but they are at

404
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,639
practices. They're busy. So, how do you

405
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,040
know if you've walked into a problem?

406
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,279
So, maybe I can grab this question. So,

407
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,519
the first thing is my best patients at

408
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,839
my office are referrals for my existing

409
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,440
patients. The second thing, if a doctor

410
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,920
tells you you have a cavity and needs a

411
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,519
filling, need a filling, ask them to see

412
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,079
the photograph, ask them to see an

413
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,000
X-ray. The last thing I would say is to

414
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:19,040
avoid um deals online um through any of

415
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,639
those online advertising uh avenues. So

416
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,240
when you do those, I can tell you right

417
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,199
now the dentists that are advertising

418
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,279
for free bleaching, free consultations,

419
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,199
they are not making any money from your

420
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,240
initial visit. They are there in the

421
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,959
hopes or of finding things to do, things

422
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,800
to work on. And that's potentially a

423
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,120
major issue. So I would avoid any type

424
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,279
of online deals. Uh that's that's a big

425
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,600
thing. Well, the office that that said I

426
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,519
had six cavities actually offered a free

427
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,199
cleaning uh free whitening with your

428
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,079
visit. So, that speaks to your point.

429
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,320
Well, follow on to uh what he said.

430
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,720
Really, it's really important for you to

431
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,279
create a trust. The bottom line is like

432
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,360
in my office, it's all about family.

433
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,839
Everybody come to me as as part of my

434
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,920
family. Um Dr. Oz is like a brother to

435
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,440
me you know and somebody might be a

436
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,680
mother to me and somebody might be a son

437
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,160
to me and they are part member of the

438
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,759
family and that's how we create trust

439
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,000
and you have to understand and and

440
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,480
develop your own treatment plan based on

441
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,639
that and say hey if this is my loved one

442
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
would I do that to that person that's

443
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,920
the key question to ask would you do it

444
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
for your family Dr. Cooper, this is a

445
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,519
big issue for you at the American Dental

446
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Association is is having a dental home.

447
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,880
It's tremendously important to have a

448
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,199
dent dental home. One thing that I

449
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,639
noticed about your experience is that

450
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,240
you were going to dentist to dentist to

451
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,079
dentist and you really didn't know

452
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,560
anything about any of them and they

453
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,079
really didn't know that much about you.

454
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,000
They didn't know your dental history.

455
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,680
They didn't know your home care regimen.

456
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,759
They didn't know whether you had any

457
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,759
what we call parapunctional habits like

458
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,160
tooth grinding and other things that may

459
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,680
make fillings and crowns more needed

460
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,680
than others. you really didn't have a

461
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,399
relationship with each other. So, what

462
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,360
you really could have done perhaps to

463
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,920
avoid misunderstanding is to try to

464
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,640
establish a dental home, a relationship

465
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,720
with a dentist that's long-term because

466
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,240
that way when things come up in your

467
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,720
mouth, you can talk to your dentist

468
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,760
about it. You can decide when to do it.

469
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,079
He will base his recommendations on how

470
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,959
likely it

471
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:22,880
is that the situation will progress. And

472
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,280
so with the relationship with your

473
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,839
dentist that's long-term, your dentist

474
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,280
knows you and can make a better

475
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,880
prognosis of what the outcome of various

476
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,720
treatment methods are so that you'll get

477
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,160
the best result for you. All right, let

478
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,840
me go back to the consumer perspective

479
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,480
here. What are your thoughts now about

480
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,160
these online rating services since you

481
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,840
did use them with some success in

482
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
predicting a bad experience? Yeah, for

483
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,600
better or for worse, people consult

484
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
these online reviews. They are very

485
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,000
popular and that is how we identified

486
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,919
the offenders so to speak that we found

487
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
um for this investigation. So you

488
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,240
absolutely can consult online reviews.

489
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,240
Also if you have a bad experience, speak

490
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,840
up about it, make it known. Post your

491
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,400
experience online so that other people

492
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,160
can consult it. It's one way to try to

493
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,320
get a sense of what's going on. We

494
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,400
should note that Dr. Rashbomb five out

495
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,080
of five stars. So he's doing quite well

496
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,280
when it comes to the online reviews. All

497
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,039
right, let me offer some final thoughts.

498
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,039
In both medicine and dentistry, we don't

499
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,480
have good resources to find the best.

500
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,520
Like when you go shopping for a car or

501
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,640
an appliance, you have all kinds of

502
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
rating systems that are pretty

503
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,080
objective. So, we've got to rely on the

504
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,559
tools that we have, like these online

505
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,840
reviews, which I think can be valuable.

506
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,360
And you got to get advice from people

507
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,720
you trust, like your friends and family.

508
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,880
Frankly, that's what I do, and I'm a

509
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,960
doctor. But most importantly, you have

510
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,360
to have the confidence to ask questions

511
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,120
if you're confused, because a confused

512
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,240
patient is not going to be a happy one.

513
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,919

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,829

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,760
Up next, we're unraveling a medical

518
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,840
mystery. How can a 12-year-old boy

519
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,520
turned to stone? We have exclusive

520
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,039
interviews with his family, his doctor,

521
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,039
and the boy himself. Stay with

523
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,679
us. Today, we're investigating a medical

524
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,360
mystery. How can a 12year-old boy turn

525
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,039
to stone? Jaden Rogers was only six when

526
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,360
his parents noticed his skin was

527
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,880
developing a stone-like texture. And no

528
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,760
matter what they did, they kept

529
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,520
spreading and getting worse. Jane's mom,

530
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,280
Natalie, is here. Jaden is backstage

531
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,520
with his dad, Tim. We're going to meet

532
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,880
them both in a little bit. Thank you for

533
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,880
being here. Thank you.

534
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,760
You said that little piece that your son

535
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,520
used to run around. Yes, he did. What

536
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,960
was his like? Tell me more about that

537
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,160
life that he had before this all

538
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:44,640
started. Um he was really energetic and

539
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,280
used to run and play and get into

540
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,600
everything he could get

541
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:54,960
into. Um he was just your typical boy

542
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:58,400
that like to play boy things.

543
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,559
How was Jaden handling this emotionally?

544
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,480
Emotionally, it's pretty hard on him.

545
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:08,080
He's pretty quiet. um doesn't talk a lot

546
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,080
about things and

547
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,440
um

548
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,640
sometimes he cries and other days he's

549
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,200
just tries to be a happy child. Um it

550
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,240
depends on the day and how he's feeling.

551
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,520
when he has the pain,

552
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,120
he's usually wakes up in the middle of

553
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:31,640
the night screaming um that he's in pain

554
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,799
and he's holding his legs

555
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,280
and needs more pain medicine and we're

556
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,720
getting to be where we're using more and

557
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,200
more pain medicine every day.

558
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,960
You're wonderful parents. Thank you.

559
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Tell the love you have with your son is

560
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,520
unbounded. But there must be moments of

561
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,520
sadness in all this. But what's your

562
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,799
biggest fear?

563
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,720
My biggest fear is pretty much that he's

564
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:03,559
going to be in tuned within himself and

565
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,320
um not being able to move without pain.

566
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:09,360
Uh

567
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,640
that the stiff skin is going to compress

568
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,760
on organs. Um, there's just not enough

569
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,520
known about it

570
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:22,880
to know what is gonna happen with Jaden.

571
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,640
You use that word in tomb. Literally put

572
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,320
it his coffin is his skin. Mhm. Yes.

573
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,679
Burying himself in his own skin. Yes.

574
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,440
Well, we're going to meet Jaden and his

575
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,960
doctors here as well to help explain

576
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,760
this medical mystery. How can a

577
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,440
12-year-old boy turn to stone? And what

578
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,270
is the best hope for his future? Stay

579
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,400
with us.

581
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,400
For 32 years, this 12-year-old's death

582
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,640
has remained a mystery until now. Using

583
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,640
genealogy and cutting edge DNA

584
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,820
technology to create her suspected

585
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:02,760
killer's face. That's coming up on

[Music]

587
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,960
Tuesday. We're back investigating the

588
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,320
medical mystery of a 12-year-old boy

589
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,400
whose skin is turning to stone. Jaden

590
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,159
Rogers symptoms started developing six

591
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,640
years ago and his parents have stopped

592
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,720
at nothing for a cure. What could be

593
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,039
happening inside Jaden's body? And

594
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,880
what's his best hope for the future?

Clinical geneticist Dr. Margarita

Science from Children's Hospital in

597
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,000
Colorado joins me now. She's been

598
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,080
working with Jaden and his family to try

599
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
to find a cure. Thank you for all the

600
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,679
great work you do at the Children's

601
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,120
Hospital. So, what was your first course

602
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,360
of action when you met Jaden? When you

603
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,919
first heard the story, right? So, as a

604
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,880
physician who cares for children with

605
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,520
exceedingly rare conditions, we prepare

606
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,840
for our visits by researching the

607
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,400
condition, but specifically for Jaden,

608
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,640
taking into account, this is a young boy

609
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,799
with a chronic medical condition. What

610
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,720
was his diagnosis? And and are any

611
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,679
doubts about whether this is what you

612
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,880
think it is? So he has a condition

613
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,679
called stiff skin syndrome and there is

614
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,000
no question that this is the right

615
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,520
diagnosis as it was confirmed on biopsy.

616
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,880
I want you all to understand how rare

617
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,880
stiff skin syndrome really is. 54 cases

618
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,200
have ever been reported including Jaden.

619
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,640
Correct. For most folks it's just it's

620
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,240
isolated to one part of the body. It's

621
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,720
just the leg or just the arm. But Jaden

622
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,200
has a progressive form. It is consuming

623
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,880
his entire body. And this worries me

624
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,080
because it can restrict his lung

625
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,600
function. You know, you can't breathe.

626
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,280
Everyone put their hands on their chest

627
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,799
right now. And push on your chest as

628
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,280
hard as you can. Then try to take a deep

629
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,200
breath in. You notice you can't quite

630
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,200
get everything in. That's what he's

631
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,559
living with every single day. And I want

632
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,039
to show you what's actually happening

633
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,640
inside Jaden's body. Because it's not

634
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,320
just about this condition, but it's

635
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,960
representative of other conditions

636
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,840
because your body is made up of genes.

637
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,000
All little parts of your DNA. They can

638
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,679
like these yellow dots that make the

639
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,200
proteins that govern our body, right?

640
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,640
And sometimes you don't have enough of

641
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,799
them. They turn off. Sometimes they turn

642
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,320
on like these red ones. They make too

643
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,159
much. You don't have a lot of control

644
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,120
over this. You're born with this. The

645
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,440
gene in Jaden's skin u is that's turning

646
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,279
it to the stone-like texture is making

647
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,880
too many of these proteins, right? Like

648
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,000
collagen and other ones you've never

649
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,600
heard of, right? things like micro fibro

650
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,960
which you know I hadn't even heard of

651
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,799
mucin uh you know and that forces the

652
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,640
skin to stay in one place like you know

653
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,880
how you have scaffolding to do some

654
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,799
construction imagine if you had too much

655
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,240
scaffolding you need these things in the

656
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,840
right amount but too much because these

657
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,480
genes are overactive put you in this

658
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,279
rigid case and as mom was saying it

659
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,600
embalms you rather intombs you right the

660
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,880
the entire layer of the of the skin is

661
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,120
involved in this and it keeps

662
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,200
progressing and it begins to look like

663
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,720
these. These are images. Dr. Science, if

664
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,520
you can walk us through this. So, this

665
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,200
is his thigh, which he says is one of

666
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,200
the areas that's hurting him the most.

667
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,000
Correct. And so, as you can see

668
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,400
demonstrated here, there's extra hair

669
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,480
that's developing and growing in this

670
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,799
particular area. And although the

671
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,799
surface of the skin itself looks normal,

672
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,640
we know the epidermis is normal in this

673
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,240
particular condition, but it's that

674
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,880
layer underneath the dermis that's

675
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,039
becoming abnormal and hardened. So

676
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,559
what's the best hope for Jaden? So I

677
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,960
think the best hope for Jaden would be

678
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,039
is if we could slow the progression of

679
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,600
this condition. So what we're doing is

680
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,480
additional genetic diagnostic testing to

681
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,880
identify the specific gene or genes

682
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,200
involved with this process. And if you

683
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,799
don't find a solution, you know, as

684
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,279
clinicians, we know the urgency

685
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,279
associated with a progressive disorder.

686
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,760
Um that's what we're concerned about is

687
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,240
cardiopulmonary function, overall

688
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,080
restriction of movement. His mom is very

689
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,760
worried about that appropriately. Thank

690
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,760
you, Dr. Stein. So, we wanted Jaden to

691
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,600
be comfortable, so he stayed backstage

692
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,320
in the dressing room and I went down

693
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,320
there to meet him and to examine him.

694
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,840
Hey, how are you? Good. How are you?

695
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,840
Nice to meet you. Hey, Jaden. How are

696
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,840
you?

697
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:10,159
Tired? Yes. What's your favorite class?

698
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:12,240
I think my favorite class is recess.

699
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,039
That was my son's favorite class. Now

700
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,760
he's smiling. He's

701
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,679
How much pain are you having from this

702
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,520
condition?

703
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,279
A lot.

704
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,799
Does it keep you up at

705
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:31,400
night? Would it be okay if I examined

706
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,400
you a little bit? Can you hold my hands?

707
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,919
Give me your other hand, too. And can

708
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,159
you squeeze my

709
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,840
fingers? You're strong. Oh my goodness.

710
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,720
So it doesn't make you weak at all.

711
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,720
You're still strong.

712
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,720
All right.

713
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,600
What What part of your body do you have

714
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:55,679
most of the thickening in the tightness?

715
00:26:51,600 --> 00:27:00,320
Um here. May I touch that area? You can

716
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:03,679
touch this part. That's just starting.

717
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,080
Oh, yes. Does it hurt when I press? No.

718
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,360
Is that how your thigh started also?

719
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,720
Yeah. Yeah. It's very hard here. All

720
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,240
through here. And this area is still

721
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,080
soft over here, though. And it goes

722
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,559
around to your back more. Do you feel

723
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,720
that? Are you able to stand here? Hold

724
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,840
my hold my hands. Just stand up. You

725
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,960
don't have to Oh, you're strong. Okay. I

726
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,919
can I'm just going to touch your back. I

727
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,440
just want to see how far that goes

728
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,240
around. And none none of this hurts you.

729
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,520
Just uh just a little bit. All right.

730
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,880
Well, don't do whatever it hurts you.

731
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,600
And And how's your balance? If I were to

732
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,039
let go of you, can you stand? Mhm. Yeah.

733
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,600
You want to try? Yeah. You can stand.

734
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,520
Oh, yeah. You stand pretty well. Oh,

735
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,559
that's

736
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,960
good. It's been a real pleasure meeting

737
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,880
beating you. Take care of you, Jaden.

738
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
All

739
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,279
right. I got to say, Jaden is about as

740
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,840
13 as a 13-year-old can be. He gave me a

741
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,240
hard time the entire time. He's quick.

742
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,760
He's sharp. And when his mind is as

743
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,440
intact as it is, and he can witness

744
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,520
what's happening to his body, it's that

745
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,799
much more urgent for us to get involved.

746
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,559
So, if you want to support Jaden's

747
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,880
treatment, please donate to his GoFundMe

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,799
thanks to our friends at People magazine

750
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,760
for their amazing footage. Visit

752

full story. We'll be right

753
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,679
back. New research shows that those

754
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,279
steaks, burgers, the bacon could be the

755
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,200
secret culprit behind your biggest

756
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,320
health issue. When you eat this kind of

757
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,880
diet, bad bacteria can overpop populate.

758
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,880
All new OS. That's coming up on

759
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,440
Monday. Most of us have a skin care

760
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,760
routine that we stick to out of habit.

761
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,919
It's all about a repetition of steps day

762
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,159
in and day out. But are you using the

763
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,399
right products the right way in the

764
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,440
right order? Today I want to clear up

765
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,000
the confusion with the help of

766
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,679
dermatologist Dr. Whitney Bow who's here

767
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,919
on behalf of my trusted sponsorship

768
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,399
partner number seven. Thanks for being

769
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,600
here. You have a very busy practice.

770
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,039
Everyone wants to go see you. What is

771
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,840
the biggest mistake you see? And you're

772
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,000
dealing with a lot of fairly

773
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,880
sophisticated people. So, believe it or

774
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,399
not, overcleansing is the number one

775
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,039
mistake that people make when it comes

776
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,360
to their skin. Now, it's okay to scrub

777
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,039
and sanitize your kitchen counter, but

778
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,039
you don't want to take that approach

779
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,039
when it comes to your face. You know, if

780
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,120
you overcleanse the skin, you can

781
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,360
actually not only strip the skin of its

782
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,279
natural oils, but you also disrupt the

783
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,559
delicate balance of bacteria on the

784
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,799
skin. Our skin is covered in trillions

785
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,880
of microscopic bacteria and they exist

786
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,760
in this very delicate balance this very

787
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,159
delicate equilibrium and if we mess with

788
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,000
that balance we can actually trigger

789
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,200
inflammation in the skin. See I thought

790
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,279
you were going to point out

791
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,039
moisturizers. Ah cuz that's a big

792
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,720
challenge I think a lot of folks have. A

793
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,120
lot of people think that all they need

794
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,360
is a moisturizer but that's another very

795
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,440
common mistake. Right. So you want to

796
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,559
keep your skin care regimen simple but

797
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,320
you also want to make sure that your

798
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,240
skin is getting you know the vitamins,

799
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,880
the nutrients, the attention that it

800
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,360
needs. So as our skin matures, yes, we

801
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,760
lose moisture. So having a moisturizer

802
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,600
as part of your skinincare regimen, it's

803
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,919
absolutely crucial for trapping back

804
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,000
that moisture, hydrating the skin, but

805
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,120
Dr. Oz, you can't rely on a moisturizer

806
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,600
alone to really drive those anti-aging

807
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,799
results. I always tell my patients, you

808
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,360
have to make sure that you're also

809
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,200
including a serum in your skincare

810
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,480
regimen because it's the serum that

811
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,559
really helps you with your aging

812
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,120
concerns, things like wrinkles and loss

813
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,760
of firmness and uneven tone. You know,

814
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,840
it's the serum plus the moisturizer.

815
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,679
It's that combination that gives you

816
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,760
even better results. And that's why I

817
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,760
like to recommend a skin care system or

818
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,159
a skincare regimen that actually has

819
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,919
agedefying ingredients in both. So,

820
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,760
number seven's Restore and Renew Face

821
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:56,240
and Neck Multi-Action Serum, followed by

822
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,960
their day cream that has an SPF 30 in it

823
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,080
really gives you that onetwo punch. And

824
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,200
just as some of the biggest mistakes

825
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,960
we're making, come on. I'm going to show

826
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,200
you why dermatologists like you argue

827
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,279
that we need a serum and a moisturizer

828
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,840
both. So, we built you a very high-tech

829
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,000
complex bottle here. This is soil,

830
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,440
basically dirt, okay? And the soil

831
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,520
represents your skin because that's what

832
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,360
your body initially gives you. And then

833
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,440
you have serum which is fertilizer right

834
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,559
and then you have moisture which is

835
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,559
actually in this case we'll just use

836
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,720
water but moisturizer does that it

837
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,960
hydrates your skin if you want your skin

838
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,039
all this stuff this raw material that's

839
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,360
so fertile to be healthy and rich like

840
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,200
this grass you have to actually address

841
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,840
it these issues unfortunately too often

842
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,559
our skin gets dry uneven it gets crackly

843
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,360
like this you don't want that so instead

844
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,440
you want to add the right serum like Dr.

845
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,440
Bo was saying, right? And as you add the

846
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,440
right serum and of course you rub it in

847
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,519
a little bit and then you combine that.

848
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,039
Remember the good serum will have things

849
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,880
like calcium in it, amino acids,

850
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,640
camides, all the things that we know

851
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,399
from years of research help the skin.

852
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,720
And then when you add the moisturizer,

853
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,200
go ahead and add that. Yep. Lots of

854
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,080
moisturizer. Then all of a sudden you

855
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,080
have this rich fertile soil which is

856
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,919
very different from the crackly stuff

857
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,919
that we started with. So compare these

858
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,720
two. Which which do you want your face

859
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,399
to look like? right? Dry and crackly and

860
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,399
therefore wrinkly, right? Or the

861
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,519
healthier looking youthful state

862
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,039
represented if you actually have

863
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,200
moisturizer with the right kinds of

864
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,720
serum added to it. If you had it all

865
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,279
together, you'll end up with this nice

866
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,600
beautiful result. In fact, you'll be

867
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,200
able to grow beautiful

868
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,080
flowers in that skin of yours if you so

869
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,720
desire. Thank you. So, a regimen like

870
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,480
this one by beauty brand number seven

871
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,080
can really help restore the skin by

872
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,679
delivering five clinically proven

873
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,360
results for the face and the neck. So,

874
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,960
when it comes to the face, it's been

875
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,480
shown to actually visibly reduce the

876
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,799
appearance of wrinkles thanks to a

877
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,039
powerful peptide blend in vitamin A. It

878
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,360
can also help firm up the skin thanks to

879
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,679
hibiscus extract and hyaluronic acid.

880
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,760
And it helps even out skin tone thanks

881
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,919
to a combination of vitamin C and Indian

882
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,840
gooseberry. When it comes to the neck,

883
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,799
it's also been shown to not only make

884
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,039
the neck skin feel firmer, but it

885
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,039
appears visibly smoother, and it just

886
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,360
helps reduce some of that crepey texture

887
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,320
that we all hate, thanks to an added

888
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,240
complex of calcium amino acids and skin

889
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,679
camides. So, you add the serum first,

890
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,600
then immediately afterwards, you can add

891
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,760
the day cream. It's all about the order,

892
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,039
right? You want to think thinner to

893
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,480
thicker, and that's one of the secrets

894
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,399
to really getting the most out of your

895
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,919
skin care products in your regimen. You

896
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,840
always want to start by applying the

897
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,000
thinner, more lightweight products and

898
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,159
then you follow that with the thicker,

899
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,640
richer, creamier ones. If you apply the

900
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,039
heavier, thicker products first, they

901
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,120
basically act like a barrier. They stop

902
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,039
the lightweight products from

903
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,679
penetrating and doing their job. So for

904
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,399
example using number seven system you

905
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,720
would start with the serum then you

906
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,120
apply the eye cream and then last as

907
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,799
your final step you apply the day cream

908
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,799
or the night cream because that's the

909
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,679
thickest layer you can do yeah you could

910
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,519
do them right after the other you don't

911
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,840
have to wait a period of time a good

912
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,760
serum will absorb very quickly so one

913
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,360
after the other you're perfectly fine so

914
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,720
it can time management issues come up

915
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,240
yeah it takes a few minutes all right so

916
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,240
you brought some real examples of a

917
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,240
volunteer skin these are actually number

918
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,399
seven's restore and renew serum treated

919
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,520
skin examples. And please, if you don't

920
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,119
mind, show us what you've got here cuz

921
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,720
this is remarkable to me. So, what

922
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,560
you're seeing here is you're seeing the

923
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,320
before photo, right? So, you know, you

924
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,079
can imagine why this woman might be a

925
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,000
little self-conscious of the skin on her

926
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,440
neck. It's a little deflated. It's a

927
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,960
little dehydrated. You can really

928
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,240
appreciate that crepey texture. That's

929
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,320
exactly what you sort of see when you

930
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,560
look at this image. But, let's back over

931
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,000
here because now this woman has used the

932
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,919
serum for about 12 months in this

933
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,760
picture. Okay? Every single day for 12

934
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,240
months. And you can see that the skin

935
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,399
looks visibly firmer. There's less of

936
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,159
that crepey texture. You know, even this

937
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,560
deep wrinkle. It was deeper on that

938
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,320
side. Look at how much more shallow or

939
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,520
tighter, more firm it looks here. And

940
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,119
then if you take a step back and just

941
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,079
look at the tone, you know, which we're

942
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,920
talking about there, like the brown

943
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,920
spots, the uneven pigmentation. It's

944
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,960
just a more even skin tone throughout.

945
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,400
Audience, don't you love the fact that

946
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,880
you could feed your skin the nutrients

947
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,079
it needs? I love that you can do it on

948
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,680
your own because it signals that your

949
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,960
skin is a living, breathing organ. I

950
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,960
wanted to see how well number seven is

951
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,400
restore and renew face and neck serum

952
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
and the day cream works. So, we gave it

953
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,000
to one of our viewers and you tried it

954
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,839
out for a few weeks. Mara, how are you?

955
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,680
Oh, great. How are you? So, let's go

956
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,440
back before we gave you the products.

957
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,000
Describe what you thought about your

958
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,400
skin. Describe it to us. Um, I I drink a

959
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,160
lot of water and I wore sunblock, but I

960
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,440
only wore sunblock with the tinted

961
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,320
moisturizer and I just felt that my skin

962
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,160
wasn't it was losing elasticity and I

963
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,720
felt like no matter how much water I

964
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,280
drank, my skin was still kind of dry.

965
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,240
And I put on the uh serum and I felt

966
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,880
like it just feels firmer. And I was

967
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,880
getting the crepey and the the little

968
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,800
drippy kind of the turkey neck, but it's

969
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,040
really I see a big difference. It feels

970
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,160
a lot firmer and I just felt that the

971
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,480
cream was amazing because it really it

972
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,400
just my makeup the base makeup. It

973
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,079
layers very very well. You put the serum

974
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,599
on, the cream on and your makeup on and

975
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,599
it's not like things are sliding off

976
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,520
your face. It's actually penetrating

977
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,560
into your skin and doing the job it's

978
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,200
supposed to. Now you made the whole

979
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,280
audience jealous of

980
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,720
you. H how do we find it? Where is it?

981
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,920
What does it cost? So, you can get the

982
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,640
serum and the day cream at Target or

983
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,920
target.com for $60 around $60 for

984
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,760
actually both of those products

985
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,960
together. It's pretty good. But the

986
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,079
thing is, these guys at Number Seven are

987
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,200
very kind. They're trusted sponsorship

988
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,440
partners of the show. What do you think

989
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,839
about the audience? I don't know. You

990
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,200
guys want to try this baby? All right.

991
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,119
Well, thanks to Number Seven. You're all

[Applause]

1009
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,320
[Music]

1010
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,400
I'm here with crime correspondent

1011
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,480
Melissa Moore, who has an incredible new

1012
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,880
podcast exploring her relationship with

1013
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,839
her father, Keith Jesperson, better

1014
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,000
known as the Happy Face serial killer.

1015
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,599
Did he pass along genetic traits to

1016
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,560
Melissa? Does she have the brain of a

1017
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:38,560
psychopath? We teamed up with the

1018
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,320
podcast masters at How Stuff Works to

1019
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,160
co-produce this chilling new podcast

1020
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:47,040
called Happy Face. and it drops

1021
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,560
today. I'm so impressed, so riveted by

1022
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,720
what you've created. Tell everyone about

1023
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,880
it. Yeah, I had a lot of questions

1024
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,720
about what my father did. And I did go

1025
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,960
to see him in prison one time and he

1026
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,680
said, "Do you want to know why I

1027
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,599
committed these murders?" And I said no.

1028
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,640
At the time, I didn't have the courage

1029
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,560
to walk down that path. And I finally

1030
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,800
had the courage to go on this journey.

1031
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,560
And I met with people, not with my

1032
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,400
father, but I met with other people that

1033
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,800
could give me the true insight and the

1034
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,599
answers that I was seeking. And along

1035
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,240
the way, I found secrets. I found family

1036
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,680
secrets out. I discovered shocking new

1037
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,119
truths about my father. And ultimately,

1038
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,800
I walked away with the knowledge that I

1039
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,240
was seeking. We all have questions in

1040
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,920
our lives. I think yours are a little

1041
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,200
bigger. The stakes are a little higher.

1042
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,480
Right? Take a look. I was a young girl.

1043
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,680
I was 11 years old. and my parents had

1044
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,560
just divorced. And this was my first

1045
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,800
summer vacation with my dad where I

1046
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,280
stayed at a different home than my my

1047
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,720
childhood home. And the moment I walked

1048
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,760
in that house, I felt like I wasn't

1049
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,599
alone, that there was energy there, that

1050
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,839
there were spirits there in every room.

1051
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,440
My first night, I fall asleep a little

1052
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,119
bit, but then I'm awakened by being

1053
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,880
touched. My hair is touched. So, I leap

1054
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,520
and I'm going to go run into my dad's

1055
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,200
room, but I

1056
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,760
froze. I wasn't going to be safe in my

1057
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,000
dad's room. And I didn't feel safe with

1058
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,000
my

1059
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,079
dad. And so, I laid on the in the

1060
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,839
hallway floor, curled up in a ball,

1061
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,880
hoping that the night would just go away

1062
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,520
fast. In the morning, my dad stepped

1063
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,320
over me and he said, "Why did you fall

1064
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,920
asleep in the hallway?" And I said, "I

1065
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,880
was being touched, Dad." and he said,

1066
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,800
"Oh, don't pay any attention to them.

1067
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,800
They bother me all the time at night."

1068
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,040
Melissa, who is your dad and what is he

1069
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,480
known as?

1070
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,320
My father is Keith Hunter

1071
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,880
Jasperson. He's known as the Happyface

1072
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,200
serial killer.

1073
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,119
That's intense. Is the journey of

1074
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,400
discovery as is as intense as it seems?

1075
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:03,520
Even more so. It was incredibly intense.

1076
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,920
and to revisit all of those old memories

1077
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,599
in the past, but to walk away with the

1078
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,920
revelations that I did was definitely

1079
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,760
worth it. I'm proud of you. I wish you

1080
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,040
best of success. Keep doing it. Keep

1081
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,960
chugging along. Thank you. You can find
