[Applause]

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,760
I finally finally How are you? How are

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,000
you? Oh my goodness. It's been like

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,559
years in the making, right? It has a lot

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
of effort. Yeah, I know. I'm so happy.

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,520
Thank you for your patience. No, I've

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,879
been a busy girl. Yeah, you have been

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,559
busy. Gratefully, actually, since

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,000
speaking of busy, everyone was stunned

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,000
watching the season finale of This Is

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Us. I know, right? So, we see you, your

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,680
character Kate gives birth to a 28-week

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,120
old child, which is a a risky time to

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,320
give birth to a child. One of our

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,399
children was born early. So, I, you

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,760
know, lived it a little bit. And, uh,

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,000
then we have, you have to fast forward

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,320
in the show, and I see the baby's okay.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,560
Yeah. I see Toby, your husband, in the

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,840
in the show is around, although he's not

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,920
wearing a wedding ring. That's what

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,119
people notice. Yes. And where you your

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,799
your character is not there. What

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,479
happened? Who she could be at the dry

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,330
cleaner. Who knows? When When did she

37
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,520
die? What

38
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,880
[Laughter]

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,159
are you a writer on the show? Do you

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,759
want to be a writer on the show? That's

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,600
the thing is what's so beautiful about

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
this is us and the writers is that

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,040
because it's not linear, we can sort of

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,600
take you everywhere and we want to go

45
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,000
everywhere, right? So, um, we'll find

46
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,680
we'll find answers in season 4, but and

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
I do know what's happening just in case

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,240
you want to know, but I'm not going to

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,840
tell you because you you don't want to

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,119
open up the present too soon, right? You

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
want to just you want to I would open

52
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,079

55
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,720
it. Don't Don't stress yourself. Just

56
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,840
enjoy it. So, I actually knew I was

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,119

cracking jokes you know in between and

70
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,920

73
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,920
just had her first live televised

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,280
performance at the ACMS alongside lots

75
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,319
of powerhouse singers including Carrie

76
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,879
Underwood. There she is. She was singing

77
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,800
her song from Breakthrough. What was it

78
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,800
like being on stage? All I mean all of

79
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,280
America is watching you. Yeah. Yeah. And

80
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
it's about a really beautiful song from

81
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
a movie we'll speak about in a second.

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,040
Yeah. I mean, it was so, you know, I'm a

83
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,720
little I'm a girl from a little small

84
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
town in Florida and you know, you sort

85
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,519
of dream about these things happening,

86
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,440
but you don't ever know if it's going to

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
really happen. And to be on the stage

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
with these incredible artists who I've

89
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,840
revered for quite some time and I love.

90
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,400
I was like, this this is a a moment and

91
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,480
a a moment for women uh women in country

92
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
music and it was Yeah, it was pretty

93
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,760
incredible. It was special. You were

94
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,440
wonderful. Thanks. I am curious how you

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,920
deal with all the emotions. This great

96
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,599
movie breakthrough it's it's riveting

97
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,239
but it is it's up and down emotionally

98
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,400
for you so so it can work for us. Yeah.

99
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,239
The the depth that you have to pull from

100
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
that well. Yeah. Uh has involved members

101
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,280
of your family. I know your mom had been

102
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,640
ill for a while. Yes. My mom had a

103
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,400
stroke um two years ago now. Um but

104
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,239
physically she's doing better than she's

105
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,560
ever done before. So it's wonderful. But

106
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,760
I understand the the fear. Yeah. when

107
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,360
she had the stroke. Oh yeah. Helped you

108
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,360
identify a bit more with the characters

109
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,400
in Breakthrough. Maybe catalyze your

110
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,640
decision to move forward with the

111
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,840
project. Absolutely. Um almost verbatim

112
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,959
were the words that I said to my

113
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,720
mother's doctors. I said, "You can give

114
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
a diagnosis and I know you're you

115
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,040
practice. You're a doctor. You don't

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,879
always know and you don't always have

117
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,400
the answers. You don't know my mom, but

118
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,560
we have to only speak positive thoughts

119
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,959
around her." And Joyce said those exact

120
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,439
same things to her son John's doctors.

121
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,560
And I thought, "This is no coincidence,

122
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,400
you know, at all." So, so this is me,

123
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,319
New York Times bestseller. I had the

124
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,879
paperback finally. Yeah. Hard to find a

125
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,840
hardback these days.

126
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,000
Famously, you comment that you had 81

127
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,639
cents in the bank when they told you to

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,320
audition for This Is Us. Yeah. Yeah. I

129
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,400
needed to borrow gas money to get to the

130
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,520
audition.

131
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,520
That's funny now. But um yeah uh you

132
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,440
know but uh yeah I mean 12 years in the

133
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,720
making of trying to aspire to be an

134
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,960
actress and you know uh it's pretty

135
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,199
incredible. I mean yeah. So have you

136
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,720
changed since you got the break because

137
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,160
there are lots of people who are still

138
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
running around with 81 cents in the

139
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,720
bank. Sure. Looking for your cab fair or

140
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,919
gas money but they're not getting the

141
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,919
role. Yeah. And I I have to just for me

142
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,440
it was never about oh I want fame and

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,280
fortune. It was like I want to relate to

144
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
people. I want people to relate to me.

145
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,840
And um I think that's so much about what

146
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,440
we do is intention and those were always

147
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,360
my intentions. So So have those

148
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,320
intentions stayed the same because there

149
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,160
temptations to alter? Sure. I mean as we

150
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,720
do and evolve sometimes for better or

151
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,039
worse sometimes. Uh and of course in

152
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,240
this industry it's it's challenging. You

153
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,840
know you're sort of treated a certain

154
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
way and I and I always have to remind

155
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
myself that like we're all the same.

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
Like I am the same as every single

157
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,560
person on watching and in this audience.

158
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,600
Like I just have a different job. So

159
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,479
Hallelujah. Yeah. So I understand you

160
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,520
are blessed to have or share a meal with

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,080
my mentor Oprah. I know

162
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,639
that. She's the best. And she apparently

163
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,479
said something to you that I I've heard

164
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,840
uh from her in the past which is you

165
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,840
should be proud of what you've done in

166
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,199
your life. Sure. Too often we sort of

167
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,280
distance ourselves. What what happened?

168
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,560
I mean, she she's not apologetic about

169
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,320
anything because she does exactly what

170
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,639
she needs to do. Also, because she works

171
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,800
so hard for it. So, I walked into her

172
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,080
home and of course I'm like, "What is

173
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,840
this place?" And I said, "Wow, your home

174
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,320
is so beautiful." And she said, "I know.

175
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,759
Thank you." And and people you you're

176
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,240
sort of like, "Uh, what?" Because we're

177
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,680
taught to sort of deflect and, oh, this

178
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,759
dress was on sale. Instead of just

179
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,960
saying thank you or just owning that

180
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,639
moment and saying, "Yeah, I worked

181
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,000
really hard for this." And that's what

182
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,759
she did. And it was like I was there for

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,520
two seconds.

184
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,360
Oprah Winfrey, folks. There she is.

185
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,960
There she is. I'm grateful to her and I

186
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,479
think about her a lot when I have

187
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,759
breakthroughs

188
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,520
sitting here on the show and talk to

189
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,199
guest because the ideas came from her.

190
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,039
Sure. Just say the wisdom of how to let

191
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,880
a guest tell their story, right? You

192
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,960
practice gratitude. Who do you look to?

193
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,199
What what what ideas come to your mind?

194
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,479
For me, I start gratitude the first

195
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,840
thing in the morning before I even put

196
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,759
my feet on the floor. When I get out of

197
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,680
bed, I at least 10 things that I'm

198
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,840
grateful for. You write them down?

199
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,759
I should just say them out loud. Um, you

200
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,680
know, I for me it just sort of centers

201
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,039
me and starts the day in a positive way.

202
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,880
So, what are you grateful this morning?

203
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,639
Oh my goodness. That I woke up, that I'm

204
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,479
mobile, that I'm healthy, you know, that

205
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
I have incredible people that love me

206
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,080
and support me and who are making all of

207
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,840
these these wonderful things in my life

208
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,360
happen. Like there's I mean, we could

209
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,199
spend an hour on gratitude. We could,

210
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,319
but we don't. But we don't. We don't. We

211
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,000
spend a lot of time on the

212
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,360
anti-gratitude issues. Speaking of

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,639
gratitude, Christy stars in this new

214
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,400
movie I've been alluding to called

215
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,880
Breakthrough, which is based on an

216
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,440
incredible true story with a big health

217
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,759
element to it. She plays a mother whose

218
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,960
son fell through a frozen lake, drowned.

219
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
When I say drowned, like literally

220
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,199
drowned. Yeah. Heart stopped beating for

221
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,120
45 minutes. And what happened next is

222
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,720
very difficult to explain with science.

223
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,479
As a doctor, I can tell you I have no

224
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,520
idea how this happened. But you might be

225
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,840
able to explain it with prayer.

226
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,280
Do you get the goosebumps we get when

227
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,360
you watch that? You know, I don't know

228
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,880
if it's goosebumps as much as it's like,

229
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
wow, that's what I have to remind myself

230
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,560
to do every day. Just surrender. And

231
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,199
it's tricky. It's really tricky to do,

232
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,800
but also because the story is so moving

233
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,440
that finally when she surrendered and

234
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,639
she trusted, that's when the miracle

235
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
happened, you know. So, when you were

236
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,759
with your mom and in the darkest

237
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,319
moments, is that what you were saying to

238
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,840
yourself? Oh, sure. you know, you pray,

239
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
you know, you storm the heavens with

240
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,520
your prayers and then you just you have

241
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,960
to let go and let God for me. Um I I

242
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,840
there's nothing else that you can do at

243
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,199
that point. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. When

244
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,639
we come back, Devon Franklin, our

245
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,000
friend, is here. He's a faith leader,

246
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,919
comes on the show a lot, and he happens

247
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,520
to be the producer of Chrissy's new

248
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,120
movie. The little clip you just saw of

249
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,800
the real life medical miracle that

250
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,360
inspired this film is next. So stay with

251
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,440
us. You know, I love I love how

252
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,599
emotional you guys are watching the

253
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,520
movie because, you know, this is a true

254
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,520
story, you know, that that we're

255
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,000
obviously invested in and it's still

256
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,839
unbelievable for me. Oh my goodness. And

257
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
it was I mean, seriously, Dennis and

258
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,039
Josh and Chrissy are so good in that

259
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,719
moment. Every time I watch it, I'm like,

260
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,640
he's not going to make it.

261
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,320
You don't know the ending. There's a

262
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
clip from Chrissy Mets in the new film

263
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
Breakthrough about a mother's belief in

264
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,440
the power of prayer to heal her son

265
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,120
against all odds. cuz he's back with the

266
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,200
film's producer, faith leader, a very

267
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,279
good friend of mine, Devon Franklin. So,

268
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,519
I appreciate the fact that you're

269
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,040
experiencing it with us. By the way, how

270
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,120
is making this movie breakthrough

271
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,360
different from making This Is Us. You

272
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,680
know, I think it's the turnaround time

273
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,200
was a little longer. We shot it in 32

274
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,519
days. You know, Kate, I've been

275
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,120
cultivating for 30 seasons, so it's a

276
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,800
little different. Um, you haven't been

277
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
public as at least I haven't seen you as

278
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,560
public about your faith as uh as has

279
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
become evident watching this movie and

280
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,200
hearing you speak about it. How how has

281
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,600
faith informed your life? Oh my

282
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,120
goodness. Faith has always been such a

283
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,040
cornerstone if not like the most

284
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,480
important thing in my life. I mean I as

285
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,160
I talk about in my book and we sort of

286
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
touched on is that I had a pretty

287
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,640
tumultuous childhood. I mean all of us

288
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
it's all relative but um I mean I would

289
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,080
go to church on my own you know because

290
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,880
I was seeking that connection and that

291
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,080
conscious contact with God and um always

292
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,680
looking for that and and luckily and and

293
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,040
gratefully I I have that and I found

294
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,279
that and that's how I navigated

295
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,360
Hollywood. But what kind of a problem as

296
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,200
a child would you have where you'd find

297
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,360
solace in church? Uh, you know, my my

298
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,959
parents divorced and my mom remarried

299
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,800
and then I became the middle child. And

300
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,959
so, like navigating that through puberty

301
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,760
with a stepfather. Oh god. You know, all

302
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,160
of those things were like, huh, what do

303
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,519
I do? And and just feeling inadequate,

304
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,240
you know, as we do, especially through

305
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,360
puberty, like my goodness. Um, so yeah,

306
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,440
you know, life, yeah, life comes in

307
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,399
handy. Have some faith. You're you're

308
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,959
one of the most powerful people in

309
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,440
Hollywood. are very uh you know polite

310
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,079
about and humble about it but you are

311
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,519
you attracted some superstars to this

312
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,120
movie but you had to get attracted to it

313
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,040
first. Why? Well, I was promoting

314
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
Miracles from Heaven um one of the films

315
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,959
I produced. And when I was promoting

316
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,600
that film, I met Pastor Jason John and

317
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,839
Joyce Smith. And when Joyce talked about

318
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,480
going in that emergency room and praying

319
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,720
her son John back to life, I said, "I've

320
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,560
got to tell this because it motivated me

321
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,480
then and it still motivates me now." And

322
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,839
I felt like this is the type of story

323
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,600
that people really want to hear more

324
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,959
about.

325
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
For years, we've watched this guy

326
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,760
inspire America, finding films to just

327
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,519
touch our chords, just play their play

328
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,480
our chords in a special way. How has he

329
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
inspired you? I Okay, first of all, I I

330
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,279
don't even know how he wakes up in the

331
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,519
gym for at 4:00 in the morning and he

332
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,680
and like before he even I I makes me mad

333
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,720
actually. Stop it. Angry. I was going to

334
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,680
say that, but I was like that's not

335
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,320
kind. Um but just the motivation and his

336
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,240
consistency. Um, and what's really

337
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
wonderful is that not only has he become

338
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,720
like a brother to me, but a friend and

339
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,959
like so much of the guidance I never

340
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,279
knew that I needed, but like I found in

341
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,040
in you and I'm just so grateful. I mean,

342
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,800
just the way that he lives his life is

343
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,880
so inspiring. Well, it's it's the

344
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,160
ethics. You true though. It's so true.

345
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,640
Speaking of the ethics of making a

346
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,320
movie, you you felt you felt you felt it

347
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,640
was very important to get the family on

348
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,839
board before you move forward. Yes. You

349
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,760
know, I mean, for Chrissy and I, no

350
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,440
matter how much we love Breakthrough,

351
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,760
this is a movie for us, but for the

352
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,519
family, this is their life, and it's so

353
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,640
important to get it right. And so, the

354
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,160
family was involved during the

355
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,320
development of the script. They came to

356
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,160
set, uh, you know, met Chrissy, met all

357
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,920
the other actors. We screened the film

358
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
for them. They love it. So, the family

359
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,800
saying that we got it right is so

360
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,959
important. It means everything to us.

361
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,920
Oh, yeah. Well, you got it right. When

362
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,399
we come back, you're going to get to

363
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,240
meet John. The film's real life medical

364
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,839
miracle. I still am curious. I don't

365
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
understand how he's able to walk and

366
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,000
talk, but can do much more. Stay with

367
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,680
us. As doctors, we believe in science,

368
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,279
of course, but science doesn't always

369
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,440
have the answer. Sometimes there are

370
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,000
things called medical miracles. John

371
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,160
Smith was just 14 years old when he

372
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,920
drowned in a frozen lake. Yeah, she

373
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,519
drowned. And according to attending

374
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,160
physicians, and they quote, I'm quoting

375
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,639
them, he was dead for 45 minutes, which

376
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,000
meant his heart had stopped. His story

377
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,079
is the inspiration for the new film

378
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Breakthrough. Despite all that, John is

379
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,120
actually sitting next to me. He's here

380
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,440
along with pastor Jason Noble. Back also

381
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,360
is the film star Chrissy Mets who plays

382
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,000
John's mom and the film producer Devon

383
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,200
Franklin. I got to say I I I only saw

384
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,480
the movie version of it because there

385
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,160
was no one filming you when you actually

386
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,839
fell into the lake. But what happened?

387
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,079
What what

388
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,920
when the ice gave way under you, what

389
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,360
did you think? You know, you're just

390
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,959
fighting for your life at that point. Um

391
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,279
it's that fight orflight instinct that

392
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,880
everyone has. And at that point it was

393
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,320
it was very scary, don't get me wrong,

394
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,760
but we knew that we couldn't get back

395
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,920
because there was so much ice between us

396
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,519
and the dock. We were 25 to 50 ft out.

397
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,959
So there was no way we could get back.

398
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,320
So at that point we were just trying

399
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,760
doing the best we can, but we knew that

400
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,000
we were staring death in the face. Your

401
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,360
two friends fell in after you and they

402
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,440
were able to get pulled out. You went

403
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
under and what did you experience when

404
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,760
you were under the dark water with only

405
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,079
ice above you? You know, for me it was

406
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,959
just I could understand how dirty the

407
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,200
water was. It was a greenish brown just

408
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,720
disgusting moss and then after that I

409
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,399
really don't remember anything just it

410
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,560
being very cold and the hypothermia

411
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,880
setting in. Patients of mine I'm a heart

412
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,120
surgeon so sometimes during the cases

413
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,320
people have problems with their heart

414
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,639
and they'll have out-of- body

415
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,560
experiences. Did you you have any

416
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,000
recollection of what happened when you

417
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,160
lost consciousness? Did you feel like

418
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,440
you were leaving your body? No sir

419
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,760
because we believe that breakthrough is

420
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,440
about a family. I mean from Devon, from

421
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,880
Chrissy, from Jason, all of us.

422
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,079
Breakthrough is about a family event

423
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,680
more than a if because if that would

424
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,040
have happened to me, it would have been

425
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,199
it would have been about my own

426
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,240
experience. Breakthrough is about family

427
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,560
and community. So in the film, John lay

428
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,880
lifeless without a pulse. Doctors gave

429
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,639
no chance of survival, no chance. And

430
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,399
then his mother prayed to God to breathe

431
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,440
life into his body. And then moments

432
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,519
later, John somehow came back, somehow

433
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,560
woke up. Have you ever experienced

434
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
something like that, Chris, in your

435
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,519
life?

436
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,839
How have you seen prayer play a role in

437
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,160
your day-to-day life? Oh, through

438
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,079
everything everything you know I do and

439
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,839
before I either make a decision or

440
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,160
whilst something is happening I'm like

441
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,160
okay please just be with me. I mean

442
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,839
literally to the performance the other

443
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,360
night on Sunday um there were some

444
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,040
technical difficulties and I thought

445
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,240
okay it's going to be what it's going to

446
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,519
be. I'm just going to surrender and

447
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,519
trust and uh thy will not mine be done.

448
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,920
Cuz you were very calm during that.

449
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,519
That's what That's what they say. That's

450
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,040
what they say. Yeah. When your mom had

451
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,240
her stroke, did you did you did you have

452
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,639
a moment where you felt you needed to

453
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,800
pray like this? Oh, sure. I mean,

454
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,639
constantly. And um Yeah. I mean, yeah.

455
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,360
All the time. And we sort of just sat

456
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,800
around her her bedside. And that's what

457
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,079
I said, like only positive thoughts and

458
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
only positive prayers. And like if you

459
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,639
have nothing good to say, then you can

460
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,920
you can step out of the realm. Um and

461
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,760
yeah, I mean, I do that every day

462
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,639
though. It's just that conscious contact

463
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,920
that that positive, you know, collective

464
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,880
energy and prayer. John, any squali at

465
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,560
all? Any side effects? Any bad memories?

466
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,399
Uh, you know, of course, I would I

467
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,040
remember some things, but God really

468
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,600
saved that and keeping it minimal. But I

469
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,120
I have no issues. I was back to playing

470
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,720
basketball within the next month to two

471
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,720
months. This is a picture of her playing

472
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,600
basketball, by the way. I can't believe

473
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,079
this. But I was back to just being a kid

474
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,079
and having fun. And you know, there's no

475
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,399
lifelong issues. The doctors actually

476
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,040
call me back just to see what's going on

477
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,240
with me and they're in awe. It's not

478
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,680
because anything's wrong. It's just

479
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,920
because they want to see me. So these

480
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,920
are these are just some of the summary

481
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,079
notes. The actual packet of your medical

482
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,639
records is quite thick. And one possible

483
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,920
theory is that the cold water because

484
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,759
when you were very cold water, there was

485
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,880
obviously ice there changes how drowning

486
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,880
happens. May have decreased the amount

487
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,880
of oxygen that John's organs needed to

488
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,800
stay alive. But you know, when you look

489
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,800
at these records, there really isn't a

490
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,519
good reason why you were able to sit

491
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,839
here, make words with your mouth, and be

492
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,360
neurologically intact. I could imagine

493
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,800
your body having survived. I can't

494
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,560
imagine your mind coming back when I

495
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,920
read what these records are re revealing

496
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,759
to me, which is the thing that's most

497
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,720
stunning. Now, Pastor Jason, you were

498
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,639
there the whole time as you as you as

499
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
you witnessed what he was like, and now

500
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,079
sitting here on my stage, how do you

501
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,000
reconcile that? You know, it's the power

502
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,600
of prayer. I mean, there's no question

503
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
when we walked into his room, the doctor

504
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,959
said he was brain dead, even after his

505
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
pulse came back. Brain dead. Rudiment

506
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,040
rudimentary brain function. Um, if he

507
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,120
survived, he would be a vegetable for

508
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,720
the rest of his life. 1% survival rate.

509
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
We took a group of pastors in and we

510
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,160
prayed that night. And some incredible

511
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,680
miracles happened in the room. And I

512
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,680
walked back out to Joyce and I said, "He

513
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,319
is walking out of the hospital. I don't

514
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,520
know how. I don't know why." You knew

515
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,480
it. I knew it. So, Speaking of Joyce,

516
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,760
your mom, I know that she's going

517
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,520
through some medical issues. couldn't be

518
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,120
here today. So, since she's not here,

519
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,799
let me ask you in privacy cuz she'll

520
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,160
probably never see this. What do you

521
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,240
think about how Chrissy played her in

522
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,839
the movie? Well, they did a sizzle

523
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,039
before the trailer and me and mom are in

524
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,640
the living room watching the sizzle and

525
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,480
we're looking at each other like, "When

526
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,559
did mom do this this sizzle? When did

527
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,160
mom over when did she do this voice

528
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,080
over?" And we're sitting there in such

529
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:38,120
confusion like, "What's going on?" Well,

530
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,120
it was Chrissy and just we were floored.

531
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,880
Feels good, doesn't it? Yeah. I mean, I

532
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,520
had to get it right. This Yeah, it's

533
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,200
Joyce. Yeah, I I wanted Absolutely. I

534
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,400
mean, it's so important. Let me give you

535
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,000
the final word. What do you want the

536
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
audience to walk away from with seeing

537
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,760
this film? Um, you know, Chrissy as

538
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,600
Joyce has a speech at the very end of

539
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,080
the film. And in that final speech,

540
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,919
Chrissy says as Joyce, that love is the

541
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,440
most powerful force in the universe. I

542
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,559
want everyone to walk out of the theater

543
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,039
knowing that love wins. And when we love

544
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,320
each other, we can have a breakthrough.

545
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,000
God bless you all. Thanks for being

546
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,919
here. Break Crew is in theaters this

547
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,360
weekend. Go check it out. And you're all

548
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,880
going home with a copy of Christy's

549
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,720
book, This Is Me. It's now in paperback.

550
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,400
