00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome to the show. If you're a dog

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,559
lover like me, and yes, that's me and my

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,960
dog Khesi. She's so cute. Then this is

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,639
very familiar to you, right? We love our

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
dogs so much. All of our pets, we let

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,400
them lick us all over it. It's how they

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,800
show their love. We all like this,

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,439
right? But what you're about to see next

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,519
may have you thinking twice. When I saw

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,400
these headlines about amputations and

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,720
even death from dog licks and bites, I

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
needed to understand what's going on.

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,520
Today, we're investigating a medical

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,120
mystery. How can a dog lick be deadly?

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,440
And could you be at

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,360
risk? You see it every day. Pet lovers

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,719
playing with their dogs and letting them

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,760
lick their hands and face. But beware,

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,840
that playfulness could be deadly. A

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,600
58-year-old Wisconsin woman made

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,800
headlines this summer when she was

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,640
nipped by her puppy. 4 days later, she

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,199
was dead. Greg Mantifal's wife, Dawn, is

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,199
grateful her husband is still alive.

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,119
They think possibly the dog licked him

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,680
and he touched his mouth or touched his

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,600
eye. Within days of petting a dog,

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Greg's face began to turn black and

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,200
blue. Doctors would later have to

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,280
amputate his forearms and legs.

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,600
Jackell went from this to this. He lost

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,439
his legs, fingers, and part of his nose

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,360
after his beloved Cocker Spaniel bit

35
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,680
him. Robin Sullins was separating two

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,720
family dogs to a roughousing when she

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,200
got nicked. Within 48 hours, she was in

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,360
kidney failure. Experts say these

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,920
infections from a dog or even a cat's

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,880
saliva are extremely rare and can be

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,159
hard to diagnose. But dog lovers like

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,479
Robin say don't blame the dogs.

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,720
This isn't about the dogs. This is a

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,399
call for the medical community to be

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,719
aware of symptoms when people come in.

46
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,200
Angela and Chris Young agree. Their

47
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,600
2-year-old son, Liam, had symptoms so

48
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,360
severe that his legs and fingers had to

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,280
be

50
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:12,280
amputated. What caused this? For 2 and

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,280
1/2 years, doctors had no answers.

52
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,560
Liam's parents, Angela and Chris, are

53
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,920
here. Angela, let me start with you.

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,319
When did you first realize there was

55
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,239
something wrong with your son? Um, back

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,560
in October of 2015, uh, he had fell what

57
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,560
we thought was the flu. So, he ran a

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,040
high-grade fever, had thrown up a couple

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,120
times, and then two days later, his

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,519
color changed, and his liver and kidney

61
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,440
started to fail. So, it's pretty fast.

62
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,160
It was it was 48 hours from the time

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,680
that he started being sick until he was

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,599
being medflighted. So, we're going to

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
show some pictures of your son.

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,760
Everyone, these images are a bit

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,840
graphic, so just be prepared, but the

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,680
the reality of what happens sometimes.

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,040
So, what did the doctor say to you when

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,120
you brought him in? Um, well, my husband

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,640
Chris when I first took Liam to the

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,040
emergency room, um, the ER doctor came

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,720
in the room, Dr. whack. And he said, "I

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,440
called for the helicopter to come up and

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,599
get him from Iowa City. He's extremely

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
ill. Um, we don't know what's wrong with

77
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,760
him. All I know is we need to get him to

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,560
Iowa City because we won't be able to

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,400
treat him here." What's it like to not

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,840
know what's wrong? It's the worst

81
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,840
feeling in the world. I mean,

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,319
cuz you never know if it when you don't

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,599
have an answer as to what caused it. We

84
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,680
didn't know if it was going to happen

85
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,879
again. We didn't know if we could

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,560
prevent it or anything like that. Was

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,599
Chris, was was Liam around dogs

88
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,599
frequently? Yes, he was. Um, we had a

89
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,519
family pet named Freya, a boxer. Um, her

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,360
and Liam were best friends as you can

91
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,239
see from the pictures and they they were

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
inseparable.

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,760
Did Did either of you ever sense that it

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,599
could have been a dog? Did the doctors

95
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,439
ever bring up the possibility that it

96
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,519
could have been your pet that was

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,799
responsible?

98
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,000
We were in Liam's room in the pediatric

99
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,599
intensive care unit when one of the

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
specialists came in and said, "We

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,239
finally got something to show up in one

102
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,560
of our blood test." And what we had show

103
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,280
up was caposphaga.

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,479
Say it again. Capnostophaga.

105
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,240
You any of you ever heard of that

106
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,759
before?

107
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
I can tell you most doctors have it

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,520
either. And we're going to talk about it

109
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,520
in a second. And that's kind of exactly

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,759
his response is this is the first time

111
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,600
we've seen it show up in a person's

112
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,120
blood work. We're running it again and

113
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,639
we'll let you know the results. Well,

114
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,800
they came back in the room later and

115
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,400
said we didn't get it to show back up,

116
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,759
so we're uncertain if that's the

117
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,360
bacteria that caused his infection.

118
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,360
Did Did you think your son would survive

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,280
this?

120
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,320
For the first 10 days, we didn't know if

121
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,040
we'd walk out of the hospital with him.

122
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,600
Um, and then as things started to slowly

123
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,000
improve, things looked better. But for a

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
while, we didn't know. Um, he was in

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,160
critical care, critical condition, and

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,199
they didn't know if he was going to make

127
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,759
it. It's one thing to be at risk. It's

128
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,440
another thing to be facing the unknown,

129
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,639
which is why after that many days, you

130
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,479
get into a spiral. So, 78 days, that's

131
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,840
it. 78 days in the hospital. That's how

132
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,840
long they spent before Chris and Angela

133
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,199
were finally able to take Liam home. But

134
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,479
for two and a half years, what caused

135
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,919
Liam's illness was still a

136
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,039
mystery. How did you even begin to think

137
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,560
that it might have been the dog saliva?

138
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,880
Well, considering that was one of the

139
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,280
tests that uh had first popped up that

140
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,680
said it could have been a possibility

141
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,199
for the

142
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,039
caposphica.

143
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,560
Um,

144
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,280
however, nothing came back conclusive.

145
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,440
So, they said they weren't sure that's

146
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,600
what it was.

147
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,360
I remember receiving a message um

148
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,240
through my email from a lady that does

149
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,080
gen uh genetic testing and she said, "We

150
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,440
seen your son's case and we're wondering

151
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,600
if you would be willing to enroll him in

152
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,600
this genetic testing because we have a

153
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,039
theory that we think might be causing

154
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,360
his illness." Um so immediately we got

155
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,240
him enrolled in that program. Actually,

156
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,479
I got the letter that came with Liam's

157
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,000
results and because you're good enough

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,360
to send along this information, which is

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
great, not just for Liam, but also

160
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,880
because it can help us with other

161
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,000
children, other adults. Here's what the

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,080
letter says. I'm going to pull out one

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
sentence. It says, "We hypothesized that

164
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,680
Liam has a genetic variant that

165
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
predisposed him to

166
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,520
capnocyto. That's a bacteria I had never

167
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,319
heard of

168
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,600
before." We're going to talk about it

169
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,080
today because I think you all need to

170
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,360
from now on. The doctor doesn't know it.

171
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,759
At least you should know it to remind

172
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,960
us. So, how's Liam doing today?

173
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,440
Wonderful. You doing well? He is uh a

174
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,560
spitfire of a 5-year-old boy

175
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,240
who he is just like every other

176
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,199
5-year-old boy. He jumps, he plays. Um

177
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,400
everything's

178
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,520
wonderful. He's just missing a few

179
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,919
fingers and toes is all. Yeah, Chris.

180
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,160
Yeah, he's wonderful. He's perfect.

181
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,560
That's He's perfect the way he He's

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,400
perfect the way he is. You all want to

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,919
meet Liam?

184
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,919
Yeah. I thought so. Well, you're going

185
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,000
to get to meet Liam and the science

186
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,880
behind a dangerous dog lick. So, I'm

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,960
going to talk about that when we come

188
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,960
back. How safe is your family? I had my

189
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,720
dog Kis you just saw tested for this

190
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,919
bacteria results when we come

191
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,840
back. Today, we're investigating the

192
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,440
medical mystery behind the shocking

193
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,280
headlines. How can a dog lick lead to

194
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,800
amputation and even death? And we just

195
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,400
heard from the parents of a little boy

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,680
who lost his legs and most of his

197
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,360
fingers. And we're going to meet him in

198
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,199
a moment. But first, how is this even

199
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,680
possible? Well, it all starts with a

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,520
specific bacteria in a dog saliva. And

201
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,280
what is this bacteria? How common is it?

202
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,280
How often does it get spread to people?

203
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,960
Dr. Casey Barton Bear Ravish is here to

204
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,360
help. She's a senior veterinarian at the

205
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,759
CDC's National Center for Emerging and

206
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,759
Zunatic Infectious Diseases. So, please

207
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,120
break this down for us. Sure. So, what

208
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,879
we're talking about is a bacteria called

209
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,039
capnoscytophaga. In animals, it's very

210
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,199
common. In fact, in dogs, 74% of dogs

211
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,680
can carry this bacteria in their mouth.

212
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,360
About 57% of cats can carry this

213
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,960
bacteria in their mouth. And it's

214
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,440
important to mention that these pets

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,199
appear perfectly healthy and happy, but

216
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
can still be carrying a germ that has

217
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,199
the potential to make people sick in

218
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,560
rare cases. And what kinds of people are

219
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,840
more likely to get ill from this

220
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
bacteria that I've never heard of

221
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,360
before? People who are more likely to

222
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,360
get ill are those who have a weakened

223
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,520
immune system. So for example, they

224
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,399
might be undergoing treatment for cancer

225
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,320
or have a disease like diabetes. Also,

226
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,719
people who've had surgery to have their

227
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,800
spleen removed are more likely to become

228
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,399
infected. Typical symptoms when someone

229
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,120
gets infected just so we can be alert to

230
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,279
it. Sure. It can start off like anything

231
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,000
else with you don't feel good, you have

232
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,160
a fever, you feel kind of flu like, but

233
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,160
in one to three days it can rapidly

234
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,480
progress to serious illness where the

235
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,720
bacteria gets in your bloodstreams. It

236
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,200
can affect your organs and tissues and

237
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,560
even lead to brain infection. This is

238
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,880
pretty scary to me. You guys feel a

239
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,800
little unquited by this. We all love our

240
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,040
pets. So, let me if I can show you all

241
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,680
how a dog lick or bite can become

242
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,680
deadly. So, dogs and cats normally have

243
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,920
bacteria in their mouth just like we do

244
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,279
by the way, right? And it's not harmful

245
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,800
usually, but if you look closely,

246
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,920
they're there. They're bacteria. Let's

247
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,080
say you're out there playing with your

248
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,720
dog and the dog scratches you by mistake

249
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,440
or nips at you or even licks you, right?

250
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,959
And then the bacteria gets into the skin

251
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,399
into your body through any opening. You

252
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,839
might just touch your mouth and now it's

253
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,279
in your blood. And once it's in your

254
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,200
blood, your immune system usually fights

255
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,920
off the bacteria. Not a big deal. But if

256
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,160
it can't keep up, sepsis can develop

257
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,440
where there's complete loss of your

258
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,120
blood pressure. Your organs begin to

259
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,399
shut down. You can't even get blood down

260
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,800
to the limbs, which means the limbs

261
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,200
begin to die. And when too much tissue

262
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,279
dies, amputation may be needed or even

263
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
death can occur to you if the tissue

264
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,839
dies too quickly. Now again, serious

265
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,959
infections from this kind of bacteria

266
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,880
are rare. So Dr. Casey, education is

267
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,560
something that's important, but from

268
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,080
what I can gather, most doctors, and

269
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,000
again, I'd never heard of this, are

270
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,519
probably like me. So to what extent is

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
this is this real? And how much time do

272
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,480
we have once someone is you touch their

273
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
mouth after being licked if they do get

274
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,200
sick? Sure, this infection can have

275
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,040
devastating consequences. I was trained

276
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,800
as a veterinarian and in veterinary

277
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
school we learned about this because

278
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,399
it's a risk for us. We are at risk for

279
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,320
being bitten and scratched by our

280
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,240
patients. So it's important to know that

281
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
we can get this. There is a need for

282
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,880
increased awareness among the human

283
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,640
medical community and I'm very glad

284
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,240
you're covering this on your show to get

285
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,560
the word out. I I bet you it's a small

286
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,399
fraction of people doctors know this

287
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,079
which is why we need all you spread the

288
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,839
word. The smartest audience in

289
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,440
television if someone gets sick and

290
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,279
we're not sure why just ask this. But

291
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
we'll come back in a second. First thing

292
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,480
I want to know how much of risk am I at

293
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
my home because I've got the three

294
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,399
grandkids running around a dog and a

295
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
cat, right? So, I'm curious if they had

296
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,160
the bacteria. You said 74% of dogs have

297
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,680
it. Is Kisia one of them? So, I I

298
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,040
actually had the vets come over to the

299
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,800
house and had them test my pets and then

300
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,399
they said the swabs that that's Kesia.

301
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,320
That's baby cat there. Not not she

302
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,240
wasn't He's not very happy with that,

303
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,240
right? And I have the results in my

304
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,160
hand. I haven't seen them. So, we're all

305
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,320
going to find out together. Be

306
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:23,680
supportive, guys. All right.

307
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:27,279
Khesi came back negative. Oh, one in

308
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,279
four dogs. I would have to applaud

309
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,519
her. Now, baby cat, who's the more

310
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,839
mysterious of the pets, that's the She

311
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,600
came back questionable. It says she has

312
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,640
a different kind of bacteria. They were

313
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,079
worried about it, but it wasn't that

314
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,720
kind of bacteria, which I'm good. I'm

315
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,680
good to go. So, what's important? Oh my

316
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,839
goodness.

317
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,800
What's important is that people should

318
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,320
not be afraid of pets. Animals, whether

319
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,320
they're covered in fur, feathers, or

320
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,760
scales, have the potential to sometimes

321
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,000
carry germs that can make us sick.

322
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,200
Capnoscyophaga is one of those. And it's

323
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,959
important to know that your dog might be

324
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,600
negative today, but maybe you take her

325
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,440
to a dog park tonight, she shares a toy

326
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,040
with another dog, licks another dog,

327
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
drinks out of a shared water bowl, she

328
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,639
could become infected. So, there's some

329
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,279
simple things you can do to make sure

330
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,880
you and your pet stay healthy. So, if

331
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,560
people going to protect themselves,

332
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,639
they've got a couple action steps. First

333
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,000
off, don't run away from your dogs. Dogs

334
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,200
are actually very good for us. There are

335
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
a lot of reasons besides the fact that

336
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,240
you love them, they love you back, but

337
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
babies that are in early contact with

338
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,240
dogs and cats, 30% less likely to get

339
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,240
colds. I wish we had a pill that could

340
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,600
do that. So, it's not bad to be around

341
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,680
pets and once in a while get lick

342
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,680
usually. And I've got to say this, if

343
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,440
you go to a hospital and there's some

344
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,639
strange thing happening that resembles

345
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,880
one of these infections you were talking

346
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,120
about, just tell the doctors, "I've been

347
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,399
around pets. I may have been licked."

348
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,079
That's all you got to say, right?

349
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,160
Simple, straightforward. Seriously,

350
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,320
you'll be surprised how simple clues

351
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,920
like that dramatically change where we

352
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,360
are. To learn more about the CDC's

353
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,839
Healthy Pets, Healthy People program,

354
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,200
you go to dr.com. Dr. Casey, thank you

355
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,560
very, very much. Congratulations.

356
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,680
Godspeed. All right.

357
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,120
Hey, y'all remember earlier we talked

358
