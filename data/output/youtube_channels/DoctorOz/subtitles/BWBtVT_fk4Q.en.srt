1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,000
We're back talking about the skin

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,240
ingredient retinol and how it can

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,320
transform your face. Now retinol comes

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,800
with lots of questions like how much

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,519
retinol do you need, right? Or when

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,359
should you use it? How much is too much?

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,960
Right? Should your face be red? I got

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,240
that question. We're back with Linda who

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,119
doesn't want to give up on retinol.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,560
Right? She has some other questions. For

11
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,840
example, how do you pick the right one?

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,840
To help answer all these questions, Dr.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,519
Froo is joining us to arm you with all

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,039
the information that will come in handy.

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,880
So, not all retinols are the same. We've

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,760
established that. Why is this a range of

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,280
retinol products on the market? Well, so

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
here's the deal. So, retinol as an

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,360
ingredient is actually incredibly

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,760
difficult to formulate. So, to start off

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,079
with, retinols are not very stable. What

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,320
does it mean? They don't like heat. They

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,480
don't like UV. They don't like oxygen

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,160
because it makes them start to degrade

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,719
and be less potent. So how you formulate

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,960
your product, how you produce it, even

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,960
how you get it properly into your jar

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,359
and there's a lot of products in the

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,519
market that are not very stable which is

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,360
why you might not be getting the results

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,720
that you were hoping and you know

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,000
expecting. Part of the reason I wanted

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,720
to hear is you actually formulate

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,080
retinol in your lab. So explain to us

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
how you think about the process when you

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,759
actually make the stuff that you that

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,600
you give to your customers. What do you

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,479
look for? Okay. Okay. Back to the

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,840
basics, right? retinol vitamin A. It's

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,520
an oil soluble vitamin. So if we are

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,600
creating once we're creating a product,

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,560
we really need first we need some sort

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,560
of oil or lipid to dissolve and disperse

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,119
our retinol in so that it's evenly in

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,520
the whole product. Um and you know and

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,280
to keep it really stable. So I brought

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,000
two very different oils here with me.

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,399
Let's see what happens when I try to put

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,479
my retinol blend into these oils. Please

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,320
do. So this is the retinol blend that uh

51
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,360
we use in our Olay retinol 24

52
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:57,119
formulations. Just a few droplets in

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,280
here. And then uh of course what we

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,680
would do, we would mix this together.

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,000
And what we're really expecting to see

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,360
is one even solution. All the retinol is

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,760
dissolved in my oil. But that's not

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
really what's happening. A lava lamp. I

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,000
mean, look at this. Yeah, it's that's

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,760
like oil oil and water literally looking

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,760
like that. But it's both oils. It's just

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,879
not the right oil that I've chosen here.

63
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,800
So, what should it look like when you

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,319
add retinol to the right kind of fat for

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,840
the right time? Let's maybe look at this

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,560
second oil blend we have here. That's

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,040
the one that we use in retinol 24.

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,000
Again, let's do the same thing. Let's

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,319
just add a couple of drops here into the

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,920
oil. And

71
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,800
again, let's shake it up. Let's see what

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,040
happens.

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,560
Ah, much better. That's what you want to

74
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,840
see a clear solution. The retinol is

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
completely dissolved. You all see the

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,680
difference between those two in the oil.

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,319
You want this mixed in nicely. This one

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,319
is not dissolving at all. So, what makes

79
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,840
the O retinol 24 different from other

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,599
retinols on the market. All right. So,

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,519
we already talked about finding that

82
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,720
optimum oil blend which might be you

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,360
know screening hundreds of different

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,200
oils but then what you do with it. So we

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,040
are trying to basically think about it

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
as we're trying to hide the retinol on

87
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,040
the inside of the product so that it is

88
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,040
stable and protected. So once we have

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,200
the oil, what we're going to do is

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,920
create what we call an oil and water

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,760
emulsion with lots and lots of little

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,680
oil droplets on the inside of the

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,800
formula surrounded by the water face and

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,280
other protective ingredients.

95
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,879
So we gave you the Olay retinol 24. You

96
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,879
tried it for a couple days. Thoughts on

97
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,599
it? So much better. So much better. So

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,200
no big blotchy rash. No. Um, my skin was

99
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,720
really smooth and bright every morning.

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
I was so excited to wake up in the

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,720
morning. I didn't have any like

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,360
sensitivity, no redness. It was just

103
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,879
really, really nice. And plus, I felt um

104
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,239
really moisturized. It was really

105
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,000
pretty. So, what do you make of her

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,080
results? Expected? Yes. Not surprising.

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,599
Really not surprising. You know, with

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
with this product, you know, you get

109
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,560
24-hour hydration, but you also get

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,560
24-hour potency. Um, you wake up with

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
that smoother, brighter skin. And that's

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,000
very much what we heard from women in

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,159
our clinical studies and our research.

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,239
The vast majority did not experience any

115
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,519
irritation. They can use it every day

116
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,920
which means they're going to start

117
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,200
seeing the results. So you say there's a

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,440
bunch of ways we can do it. So las

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,680
microscoping cream can also play a role

120
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,600
in this just to be clear. So who uses

121
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,880
this, right? And what are the other

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
options if you don't want to have it all

123
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,520
mixed together for us? The convenience

124
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,199
is great, right? I mean, this is, you

125
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,600
know, if you're a kind of a one-step

126
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,680
nighttime regimen person, you just want

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,759
to moisturize but have all the benefits

128
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,680
of retinol. This is it. A one-step

129
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,000
process. Great. But you could also use

130
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
the serum and then maybe on top a

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,199
different moisturizer like my favorite,

132
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,320
the Olay Regenerous Microscoping Cream

133
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,160
for flexibility. Take it. Up to you.

134
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,759
We're we're not we're not telling you

135
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
what we what you have to do. We're just

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,880
creating fabulous products and how you

137
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
use them is really down to your product.

138
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,479
So no matter which you choose, how do

139
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
you apply retinol correctly? Yeah. So

140
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,440
there's a couple of things. So a, you

141
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,680
know, we heard that retinols can be, you

142
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
know, sensitive to UV. So that's why

143
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,199
it's usually best to use them at night.

144
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,800
And then the other thing is, I mean, you

145
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,880
have to stick with that for a little

146
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,320
while, right? I mean, results like 28

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,400
days is a really good period, you know,

148
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,160
four weeks, which is not super long. And

149
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,639
that's when you really start seeing more

150
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,039
and more benefits. You feel safe now?

151
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,120
Yes. All right. Up next, thank you,

152
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,800
Rocka. The most delicate area of skin

153
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,320
that may be giving away your real age.

154
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,880
Find out what it is when we come

155
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,880
back. Not all skin is created equal,

156
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,639
which is why the delicate skin around

157
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,280
your eyes may need a little bit extra

158
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,120
TLC. It's thinner with fewer oil glands,

159
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,759
more sensitives, prone to issues like

160
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,280
puffiness, discoloration, wrinkles. Here

161
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
are some pictures of my audience

162
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,240
members. Their eyes are looking right at

163
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,479
us. Whose eyes are these? Because you

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,320
get to be my guest of the day. Who is

165
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,520
it? Oh. Oh, I got the victim right here.

166
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,440
How are you? What's your name? How are

167
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
you? I'm Erica. You do have very pretty

168
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080
eyes, Erica. Oh, thank you. Thank you.

169
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,520
So, what do you think about your eyes?

170
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,240
What can you are they just the way you

171
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,240
want them? Well, I have on concealer

172
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,039
right now, but in the morning, I'm like

173
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,120
really dark around the eyes. So, um you

174
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,680
know, just due to stress and just do to

175
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,960
just life. So, I just put like a little

176
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
something on. So, I'm trying to get rid

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,440
of that. Do you like taking tests? Yes.

178
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,280
You all like taking tests? Yeah. This

179
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,560
test Julia, come on down here. Give you

180
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,240
a little quiz everybody. We've created

181
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,919
with our partner Olay to help determine

182
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,199
your skin care product for the eyes.

183
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,639
It's got to be customized. Olay

184
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,880
scientist Shannon Whites is here to walk

185
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,800
us through it. Everyone follow along.

186
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,000
Keep track of your answers. Super

187
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,960
simple. Three questions and then

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,960
Shannon's going to explain what it

189
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,639
means. Okay, you got this, Shannon. Got

190
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,319
it. Question number one, which best

191
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,000
describes the way your eyes look? Think

192
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,440
about this in your mind now. All right.

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,280
So, A, crepey and dry. B, not sure. Need

194
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,800
all kinds of help. My eyes look older

195
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,360
than my face.

196
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
C. Dark circles. I haven't slept in

197
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,560
days. Yeah, you. One of those letters

198
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,960
applies to me, but we'll get to that

199
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,120
later. Question two. What do you tend to

200
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,319
do to combat your under eye concerns?

201
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,680
Your eye concerns in general. So, A,

202
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,800
cucumbers and cold spoons. B, eye mask

203
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,360
makeup the works. C, try and get more

204
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,880
sleep. You keeping track here? Yes. All

205
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,960
right, last question. What kind of

206
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,680
benefit do you think you want from an

207
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,960
eye product? So, A is one that is

208
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,840
moisturizing and cooling. B, one that

209
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,599
does double duty, so it conceals and

210
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,520
corrects. C, one that makes me look wide

211
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,199
awake and fades my dark circles. All

212
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,039
right, Eric, you tied up your answers?

213
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,639
Yes. Let's walk down here. So, no matter

214
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,319
what you all answered, there's a

215
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,319
solution for you. That's the real

216
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,520
essence of today's segment to get you to

217
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
appreciate that if you're wise about

218
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,000
what your problems are, you can

219
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,680
customize the perfect solution for it.

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,720
So, who out there answered mostly A's?

221
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,639
Hands up. Mostly A's. All right. So for

222
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,560
A's, they have dry skin under their

223
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,160
eyes. So if you said A, mostly A's, what

224
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,759
do you what do you have for us? Yeah. So

225
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,840
if you answered A, you're looking for a

226
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,840
deep hydrating eye gel. So where about

227
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,199
A's again? I got solutions for you. Oh,

228
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,479
where where's Oh, there's an A right

229
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,160
here. So close. More A's. Gez. Olay's

230
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,160
deep hydrating eye gel is actually a

231
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,080
hyaluronic acid formula that's going to

232
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,639
hydrate that dry skin around the eyes

233
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,080
for a more refreshed look. Right. How

234
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,759
many B's are there? Put your hands up

235
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,919
for your bees. Oh, there are a lot of

236
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,639
bees. More bees. Okay. All right. So for

237
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,160
bees, they have puffy and wrinkly eyes.

238
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,240
Here, you do this. Now you walk around

239
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Bob. Very good. Now keep Erica busy. All

240
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
right. So if you were bees, you're going

241
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,440
to look for a threein one. So I really

242
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,319
like the Olay Ultimate Eye Perfecting

243
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,919
Cream. So it actually has some titanium

244
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
dioxide in there to give it kind of a

245
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,399
touch of concealer, but it won't bleed

246
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,320
or smear, and it blends with every skin

247
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,880
tone, which is huge. The other thing

248
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,880
that it has is amopeptides. So, those

249
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,200
are going to help build your skin from

250
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,279
the inside so that way you can see

251
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,560
visibly firmer skin on the outside. All

252
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,279
right. And finally, C's, which I've been

253
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,519
told, yes, you feel like a C. I feel

254
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,600
like a C. All right. Every day. But the

255
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,839
C's, they seem to have dark circles.

256
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
What causes the dark circles? So, it is

257
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,440
mostly genetics, but they can be

258
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
exacerbated by your lifestyle. And what

259
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
do you have for us as a solution? All

260
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,680
right. So, you want something that has

261
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,399
vitamin C and caffeine that's going to

262
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,560
really improve and brighten that eye. I

263
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,959
personally like the um Olay brightening

264
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,640
eye cream for dark circles. But what's

265
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,920
what's actually in the cream that let it

266
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,120
work the way it's supposed to? This is

267
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,080
the fun part. So, we're going to come

268
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,760
over here. So, what I have here is a

269
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,000
little bit of a deconstruction of the

270
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,040
product. Some of the key components of

271
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,440
the the Olay eye brightening cream. So,

272
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
what you'll notice is that uh you can

273
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,040
see how the ingredients here worked

274
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,959
together to kind of reflect the light

275
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,000
away from the eyes. We've really worked

276
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,800
to kind of enhance and make this a very

277
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,440
unique blend so that it reflects light

278
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,040
for everyone for any skin tone and

279
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
really works to really brighten that eye

280
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,000
area. How do you actually apply it here?

281
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,279
That'll be all right. Let's work on

282
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,040
that. So, what you want to do is you can

283
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,600
use uh this product in the morning and

284
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,600
the evening on cleansed skin. And you

285
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,040
want to take um a little bit of the

286
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,279
product and you want to make sure you're

287
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,279
dabbing it all around the eye. So you

288
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,680
want to use it under the eye, the outer

289
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,760
corners of the eye, and the eyelid. Um

290
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,839
and then you'll want to then kind of

291
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,920
really make sure it's it's worked into

292
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,079
the skin and fully absorbed. How long

293
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,440
until Erica sees the results? So what

294
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,279
you're going to actually notice an

295
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,279
improvement in the skin feel right away.

296
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,959
So, after the first use, and what's even

297
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,640
more amazing is after four weeks, you're

298
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,480
going to see that physical reduction in

299
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,160
the dark circles. That's what we're all

300
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,399
looking for. Grab it out of her hand

301
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,360
quickly. Take it from her before she

302
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,160
changes her mind. All right, the

303
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,079
transformation you have to see to

304
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,440
believe with the product picks you can

305
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,240
afford. Take a look at what's taking

306
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,720
place backstage right now. We'll be

307
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,720
right back with more.

308
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,700
[Music]

309
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,700
[Applause]

310
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,680
That was a sneak peek at what's been

311
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,600
going on backstage. Now, if you're tired

312
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,760
and stressed out like so many of us are,

313
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,079
you got the 10-minute transformations

314
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,399
you have to see to believe. Take a look

315
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,560
and see if these hardworking women sound

316
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,320
like you. Hi, my name is Karen

317
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,880
Tapalleski. I've been a nurse for 10

318
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,800
years. I work in the surgical ICU and

319
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,880
most importantly, I work night shift.

320
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,720
night shift is just a whole different

321
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,519
environment. I pretty much live off of

322
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,040
coffee, caffeine, tea, just sheer

323
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,120
adrenaline some days trying to get

324
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,120
through. She's always there for all of

325
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,560
the other staff members on night shift

326
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,120
and she's always doing it with a

327
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,760
positive attitude and a smile.

328
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,880
Last October, my mom found her breast

329
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,640
cancer had come back. We had her home

330
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,800
and I helped my dad take care of my mom

331
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,440
handle her medications, doctor's visits,

332
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,519
just pretty much nursed 24 hours a day.

333
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,480
if it wasn't, you know, at work, it was

334
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,120
at home. It was a very, very emotional

335
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,440
struggle year to try and separate home

336
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,760
and work and still, you know, make a

337
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,680
living and provide for my family. It's

338
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,120
worth it. Even my worst days, I I love

339
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
what I do. I get to take care of

340
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,200
patients and just use my knowledge, my

341
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,639
experience, you know, to really try to

342
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,560
help them. Hi, I'm Lori. I'm a nurse.

343
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,480
I've been a nurse for about 11 years

344
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,720
now. I'm a single parent to four

345
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,440
children. So, my time is spread very

346
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,240
thin. On the days when I work, I get up

347
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,920
between 4:30 and 5:00 in the morning. My

348
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
feet hit the floor. I'm running trying

349
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,800
to get the kids ready, get them out the

350
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,160
door, get them to daycare, and make it

351
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,800
to my shift on time. And then it's 12,

352
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,360
13, 14 hours before I get home again.

353
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,959
This past year, I started in school.

354
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,600
I've been studying to become a family

355
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,839
nurse practitioner. That has made our

356
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,760
schedule even more difficult. um

357
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,519
juggling trying to make sure that my

358
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,800
children all make their appointments.

359
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,959
So, it's just a challenge. Consequently,

360
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,839
um I'm the last on the list. I take care

361
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,880
of my children. I make sure that I do my

362
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,120
work. I get to school on time, but I

363
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,839
would like to take care of myself a

364
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,680
little bit better.

365
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,160
After the surgery, I know firsthand the

366
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,240
integral role Cin and Lorie play in our

367
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,079
healthcare system. I know they deserve

368
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,000
to be rewarded. So, beauty consultant

369
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,160
Danielle Gay gave Corin and Lori

370
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
backstage makeovers just minutes before

371
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,079
they are coming out here. You're going

372
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,680
to see it right now. We are dying. I'm

373
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,519
dying. I'm dying. I would have seen it,

374
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,120
but there you were there. I want to see

375
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,120
it again. All right, Corin, you're up

376
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,120
first.

377
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,440
Oh, the makeup got her

378
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,440
smiling. And now, Lori, it's your turn.

379
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,079
Very

380
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,680
polished. Very elegant.

381
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,040
So Cody, what's been the most surprising

382
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,399
thing about this makeover? I saw you

383
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,079
before. By the way, thank you both for

384
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,519
all your work in the hospital. It be,

385
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,279
you know, there there's no medical

386
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,120
system without the nurses. What's the

387
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,639
most surprising thing for you? Really,

388
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,720
just how quick she transformed me from

389
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,519
looking tired and exhausted and to

390
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,120
looking like this. You have lives to

391
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,199
save. And Roy, why is the makeover so

392
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,040
important for you? Well, having a

393
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,639
routine that I can do in the morning

394
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,120
that's just for me will help me to have

395
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,040
the confidence to keep going and doing

396
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,839
what I'm doing. So, can we show the rest

397
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,279
of the country exactly how Danielle did

398
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,639
this? Come on over. Danielle did all

399
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,839
your magic backstage. So, you got to

400
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,279
walk us through the process of what you

401
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,920
did so everyone at home can take

402
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,000
advantage of your wisdom. Yes. So, of

403
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,680
course, your makeup routine starts with

404
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,959
your skinare routine. We prepped the

405
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,160
ladies with the Olay Regenerous

406
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,920
Microsculpting Cream. One of my

407
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,760
favorites. It's a great dewy finish

408
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,519
moisturizer. Then you move on to

409
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
foundation. So, foundations come in a

410
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,839
variety of undertones. So, a quick and

411
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,920
easy trick is with your jewelry. If you

412
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,920
look best in gold, you're warm. If you

413
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,440
look best in silver, you're cool. And if

414
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,440
you look good in both, you're neutral.

415
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
Perfect. It's It's easy cheat. All

416
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,399
right. So, if you want to add a

417
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,560
dimension to your face, quick trick.

418
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,720
Give us some hacks. Super quick trick is

419
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,480
to lift underneath the eye area. So,

420
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,760
you're going to do that with concealer.

421
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,199
Now, a lot of times you see concealer

422
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,519
where it's just dotted underneath the

423
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,519
eyes, and that's not really, you know,

424
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,600
really getting that surface area. So,

425
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,000
better way to do it, an upside down

426
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,199
triangle. So that upside down triangle,

427
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,399
that's going to get the areas where

428
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,000
there's dark circles, any other

429
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,959
discoloration. And then you definitely

430
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,880
want to make sure that you blend that

431
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,480
out. Dr. Eyes, you're truly concealing.

432
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,839
Yes. Yeah. I like I like I leave mine

433
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,920
like little red patches. I can play a

434
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,680
football game. Yeah. Going to battle.

435
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,519
Right. And then blend it out. Then you

436
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,279
want a quick finish with mascara. Yes.

437
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,120
So a lot of thing a lot of times with

438
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,120
mascara, what you want to look for is a

439
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,279
thinner brush because a thinner brush is

440
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,680
really going to get those inner corners

441
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,519
and really give you a lot of volume and

442
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,440
a lot of lift. And you're going to go

443
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,920
from the root and wiggle out to the to

444
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,600
the tips. Gives you a nice fanned out

445
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,839
lash. Can I see your smiles? You guys

446
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,480
deserve. That's that's what I want.

447
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,680
Happy nurses. Yes. Daniel, very nice.

448
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,440

449

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,040

452
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,240
community is finds nursing invaluable,

453
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,519
but more importantly, America sees it as
