00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,920
Today on Dr. Oz, I'm being rigged with a

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,600
hidden camera to investigate the food in

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,240
dollar stores. That's right, you guys.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,080
People more than ever, thank you, are

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,519
shopping for the groceries at dollar

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,440
stores. So, I'm going in to see what's

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,720
what and see if it's even safe to eat.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,279
Come join.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,960
Boom. Today, there

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,199
are You love this. You know why they

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,279
care? Because there are more dollar

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,160
stores in the United States than all the

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,920
Walmarts and all the Starbucks combined

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,399
and more and more people are relying on

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,320
them for their groceries. But are you

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,079
making a healthy choice? That was health

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,719
guru Jed Weedstrom from The Biggest

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,559
Loser who sent her undercover to a local

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,120
dollar store to investigate. Let's see

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,559
what else she found. We all know that

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,879
dollar stores are great for party

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,520
supplies, but what about the food? I'm

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,520
going to check it out.

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,250
[Music]

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,160
And I did not expect to find you here.

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,440
Apple cider vinegar. This is amazing. I

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
literally have this part of like my

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,040
daily uh regiment. What else we have

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,159
going on here? And quick oats. I

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,880
literally just ran out of these.

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,159
Perfect. Every day I have these as well.

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
I'm getting some good things here.

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,880
Actually, I'm going to check out the

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,720
freezer section, too. See what they

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,640
have. Oh, wow.

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,080
I'm kind of pleasantly surprised here.

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,720
Look at all these great vegetables.

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Green beans, spinach, you've got

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,759
asparagus. I mean, most time at the

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,000
grocery store, it's $3 a bag, so this is

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,680
a good steal. Oh, even got frozen corn.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,159
Dr. Oz, aren't you proud of me? I'm

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,040
getting my vegetables

44
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,680
in. And steak. Literally steak at the

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
dollar

46
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,280
store. Have Have you tried the ribeye

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,560
before? You tried the ribeye steak?

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,200
Yeah. Is it any good? Yeah. Okay, it's

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,280
going in my

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,960
cart. Why

51
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,079
not? Last but not least, the staples for

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,719
anyone's kitchen. Eggs and milk. A buck

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,000
a piece.

54
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,759
Perfect. That wraps it up for me. I'm

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,020
going to go home now and see if my picks

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,959
pass here at the dollar store.

57
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,640
[Music]

58
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,800
You look good in glasses, don't you

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,280
think? Oh, thank you. It's like a spy

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,720
movie. But but you were surprised by

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,160
some of the healthy items you found in

62
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,680
the dollar store. Yeah, it was actually

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,720
fascinating and I was as I kind of said

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,800
in the video, I was impressed that

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,239
they've uh these dollar store chains are

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,599
they're rolling out this better for you

67
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,280
kind of grocery item list because

68
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,200
they're realizing that families want to

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,519
provide uh better items for their

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,120
households and from refrigerators to

71
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,400
other produce. It was like I said, I was

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,519
very impressed. All right, you're going

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,120
to walk us through it. Yeah. All right,

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,800
so let's take you through some of the

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,440
dollar store grocery finds. We're going

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
to reveal if they are a pick or a pass.

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,959
First up, one of my favorite things,

78
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
apple cider vinegar, but purchased in

79
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,239
the dollar store. I saw you grab it off

80
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,760
the shelf in the very beginning. What do

81
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,200
you look for? So, one thing you want to

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,519
look for is that know that it's between

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,959
four and 5% acidity, which it has here,

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,080
which is great. Again, if it's not

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,840
working for you, it's not going to work

86
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
in your body. Uh, the other component

87
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,879
here that was really important was

88
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
expiration date. So, if you have those

89
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,200
two things, then you get a pick for me,

90
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,959
which this one did. A dollar store pick.

91
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,080
She got it. A little more excited. She

92
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,040
picked it. Okay. Next up, dollar store

93
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,720
milk. We have William here who always

94
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,120
buys milk at the dollar store cuz it's

95
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,800
only a dollar, but his wife Vivian is

96
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
very savvy and she doesn't always agree

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,879
with that. So, Vivian, what worries you

98
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,599
about the dollar store milk? Well, um I

99
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,480
worry about the expiration date. It's I

100
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,560
I don't think it's healthy for us. For

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,760
me, as long as it's not expired, it's

102
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,599
good to go. I I'll drink it. Right. So,

103
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,879
we got a little argument here. The the

104
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,400
expiration, you wouldn't buy it if it

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,920
was already expired. No, not if it's

106
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,959
expired. because it's not expired. I

107
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
definitely would pick it up. Okay. Okay.

108
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,920
It's a smart man and this smart woman.

109
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,519
So, we got already great things. I can

110
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,840
see why you're married. Okay. But here's

111
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,440
the thing. Um I had the same uh

112
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
curiosity around that as well because I

113
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,319
think of these items that have been

114
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,560
living there for a while that's at the

115
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,480
end of their life kind of and what I

116
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,159
found is there weren't any expiration

117
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,680
with the milk. So, you kind of get a

118
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,280
point. But I did kind of find something

119
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,480
else. What's that? Do you all want to

120
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
know? Yes. Great. Okay. So, what we have

121
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,080
here is a dollar's worth of milk at a

122
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,080
dollar store. However, when we're

123
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,599
shopping at bigger grocery stores, this

124
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
is what we usually buy. Look familiar to

125
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,680
anybody? Yeah. Yeah. I see a lot of

126
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,919
people. Okay, good. So, the differences

127
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
is what you're getting for your dollar.

128
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,960
Do you want to see what you're getting

129
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,800
for a dollar store dollar? Sure. Yeah.

130
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,560
Follow me. Come on. We're going to get

131
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,600
some help on here. Okay. So, here's a

132
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,280
little list I have you. I'm going to

133
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
stand right here. I want to know how

134
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,199
much you think it would cost for a

135
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,680
gallon of dollar store milk. I've got

136
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,120
this awesome little thing here and I

137
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,960
want you to go through and how much do

138
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,360
you think for one gallon of dollar store

139
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,720
milk would it cost? That's tough. Uh you

140
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,840
can help out if you want, guys. Price is

141
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,160
right. Right. Come on. Um

142
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,440
four. Three.

143
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,600
Four. Three. There's a six. I'm going.

144
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,040
All right. Four. Four. It is. Okay.

145
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360
Whoever was yelling for four, he heard

146
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
you. Okay. Um Well, it's a very smart

147
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
audience. It's not a bad way to go. But

148
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
yeah, but that would mean, guys, that

149
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,720
would mean four of these would be into

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,039
here. Does that make sense? No. Who's on

151
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,639
my side? Yep. So, let's bring it

152
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,160
through. How much higher?

153
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,160
Eight.

154
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,080
Nine. Six. Who said eight? Yeah. Look at

155
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,759
them up there. All the women. Oh, nice.

156
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,240
$8. So, although it's not expired and

157
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,759
it's okay to drink, it's not worth the

158
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,880
deal. You're not getting enough for

159
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,080
You're not getting the bang for your

160
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,759
buck. Right. So that's what we're doing.

161
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,840
Right. Exactly. Yeah. So dollar store

162
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,680
milk is a pass. So you both are right

163
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,000
and marriages are safe everywhere. She's

164
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,440
writer. She's right.

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,320
All right. Next up, dollar store steak.

166
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,759
Steak. So the best way to tell if it's

167
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,680
going to work for most of us is to let a

168
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,199
couple experts taste it. Oh yeah. Two

169
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,960
people who know a lot about steak. Matt

170
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,600
and George are two firefighters who

171
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
pride themselves in cooking some of the

172
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,280
best steak in their firehouse. So,

173
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,880
they're tasting the two kinds of steak.

174
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,080
You've got a little bit on the blue

175
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,840
plate, a little bit in the white plate

176
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,800
there from different kinds of stores.

177
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,639
One of them being a dollar store. So,

178
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
compare them. Contrast them for me,

179
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,199
Matt. Yeah. So, you have this guy. You

180
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,479
can immediately tell it's thinner. It's

181
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,720
probably a little But size isn't

182
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,160
everything. Yeah, exactly. But you bite

183
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,680
into it, you would think you would think

184
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,880
a thin steak like that, it would be

185
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,000
tough. it would be chewy, but it's

186
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,880
actually very watery and it's very chewy

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,160
and it it doesn't have that that steak

188
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,840
feel that you have in your mouth when

189
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,600
you bite into a nice juicy steak.

190
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,880
George, a couple adjectives to describe

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,319
the white versus the blue. So, if

192
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,160
something you look for in a steak is

193
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,919
like fat, good fat content, something

194
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
like that. Obviously, marbleization,

195
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
things like that. Um, and you look at

196
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,840
it, they obviously both have fat. Um,

197
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,160
but this one, it's like grease. It's

198
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,319
coming out greasy and almost

199
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,520
unappetizing like a sad little steak and

200
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,360
uh sad. Yeah. And then you have the

201
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,960
obviously the better steak which is

202
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
appetizing and something that you want

203
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,880
to eat where this is I had the more

204
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
choke back. Well, it wasn't hard for

205
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,319
either of you to identify that the blue

206
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,160
is actually the better quality steak.

207
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,120
Pennywise pound foolish in this case.

208
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,560
So, dollar store steak gets a pass when

209
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,000
it comes to meat. We don't we don't get

210
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,599
it from the dollar store. A pass. Yeah.

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,759
God bless you for what you do. Thank you

212
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,680
very much. All right, next up, let's get

213
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,800
some of Jen's favorite dollar store

214
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,800
picks. These are things that are

215
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,479
no-brainers. Walk us through them. So,

216
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
these are what I call my staple items in

217
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,440
my kitchen, and I was really excited to

218
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,080
see that these dollar stores had made

219
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,759
them a part of their uh grocery list. Uh

220
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,240
quick oats. There's literally one

221
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,039
ingredient in here, which are oats.

222
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,880
Thank you. You are so smart. Oats.

223
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,039
Exactly. The other thing I love were the

224
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,039
frozen vegetables. And this one should

225
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,720
be in everybody's kitchen. Okay. When it

226
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,880
comes down to it, eggs are an excellent

227
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,160
source of protein, of fat that I could

228
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,000
do eggs for breakfast, lunch, and

229
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,240
dinner. Uh, and for a dollar, especially

230
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,440
if you have a family, it it's it's kind

231
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,560
of the no-brainer for me. So, I was

232
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,479
pumped to see that on the on the

233
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,160
shelves. As we challenge natural food

234
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,000
chef and author of Meat on the Side,

235
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,680
Nikki Dinky, to come up with a healthy

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,919
meal using these dollar store grocery

237
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,319
picks. Let's see what she came up with.

238
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,000
Hey, Dr. Oz, I'm psyched about these

239
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,639
dollar store finds. These are really

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,879
good ones, especially the oatmeal. So,

241
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm thinking we take all of this and

242
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,720
make a savory oatmeal bowl with spinach

243
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,039
and corn and pico de gallo and an egg on

244
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,199
top. It's going to be amazing in less

245
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,039
than 5 minutes. I've got some boiling

246
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,639
water for our oats. But before I put the

247
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,240
oats in, I'm going to put in some of

248
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,800
that frozen spinach and frozen corn. And

249
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,800
then our

250
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:38,320
oats. All right. So, some of this

251
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,080
salsa. Now, this is a little bit

252
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,680
optional, but I had some avocado on

253
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,839
hand. Last but not least, this crispy

254
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,560
fried egg, a little bit of black pepper,

255
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,200
and of course, a touch of hot sauce.

256
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,200
That salsa on top just does it for me.

257
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
And the pops of sweet corn, that crispy

258
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,040
egg. I'm telling you, this is the way

259
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,640
that I want to start every day. Cheers.

260
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,080
Coming up, the important thing to know

261
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,680
before buying dollar store pain

262
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,519
relievers. Plus, which of these health

263
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,200
and wellness products is the biggest

264
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,080
dollar store steel? Find out when we

265
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,160
come back. Dollar stores in with rock

266
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,160
bottom prices. But when it all comes to

267
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,160
our health, you know, can they really be

268
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,160
trusted with it? Jen Widers went

269
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,480
undercover to a local dollar store to

270
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,480
investigate the picks and passes for

271
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,040
dollar health and wellness items. Take a

272
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,399
look. I'm back at it and I'm headed to

273
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,480
the health and wellness aisle to look

274
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:36,160
for deals on ibuprofen. Let's go. Ah,

275
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,160
found it. Yes, it can be up to $8 at

276
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,399
normal drugstores. This is pretty great.

277
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,720
While I'm at

278
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,279
it, allergy medicine. I need it cuz

279
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,560
listen to me right now. And who doesn't

280
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,600
need vitamins this time of year? We're

281
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,839
all getting sick. We need to stay

282
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,959
healthy. Going to grab some for me. Grab

283
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,959
some for my

284
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,399
friends. Jackpot reading glasses. I

285
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,560
mean, I'm always on the lookout for new

286
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,600
pair of statement lenses, right? All

287
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,600
right. I'm trying some on here.

288
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,940
[Music]

289
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,360
I think these are my favorite. This is

290
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,120
it. You're going home with me. Last

291
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,480
thing on my list. I can't get through

292
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,959
the week without

293
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,959
coffee. Now I'm done.

294
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,079
You had a good time. I'm so silly. It

295
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,160
was so much fun. You look like a spy

296
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,160
undercover. Oh, big time. You actually

297
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,240
sort of were finding things out. Oh,

298
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,839
very much so. Yeah. So, the first thing

299
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,000
she wanted to look at today was dollar

300
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,120
store medications and vitamins. These

301
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,040
things come up a lot because they're

302
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,040
pricey. They Right. They cost a lot. We

303
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,160
think they're good for you. Is it worth

304
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,519
getting a little bit of a discount at a

305
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,720
dollar store? How do they stack up? You

306
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,320
know, to be honest, it was a little

307
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,399
tricky because I was actually excited to

308
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,880
see the variety that was in place, but

309
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
so many supplements, vitamins, they're

310
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,519
not regulated very well. So, are they a

311
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,680
pick or a pass? Sounds like pass. It's a

312
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,360
pass. All right. Next. dollar store

313
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,200
reading glasses, which you had a lot of

314
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,640
fun. Oh, you notice it should be illegal

315
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,160
what you just did in there. Now,

316
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,040
Michelle was curious about this because

317
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,200
Michelle's notorious amongst her circle

318
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,600
of friends for breaking her glasses. Are

319
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,320
these examples? Yes, Dr. Eyes. I break

320
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,399
all of my glasses. Yeah, I sit on them.

321
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,000
I step on them. I drive over them.

322
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,600
That's right. All right. So, you need to

323
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
buy glasses. You look around for them.

324
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,399
Glasses can also get pricey sometimes.

325
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,399
You're buying five, six, seven pairs at

326
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,399
a time and then they take a, you know, a

327
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,000
while for them to like make the glasses.

328
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,360
So, I don't want to wait. Well, that's

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
actually kind of where I saw a solution

330
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,680
in these dollar stores. I mean,

331
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,360
obviously, I was kind of being silly and

332
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,279
trying them on, but at a dollar a

333
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,600
repair, someone like Michelle could

334
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,760
actually find that as an asset and where

335
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,079
you don't have to be as worried about

336
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,640
what happens to them.

337
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,800
Oh, doctor. So, I have a little test.

338
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
He's very interested here. I had a test

339
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
that I wanted to perform with Michelle.

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,560
And what that is is I asked you previous

341
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,880
to the to my little experiment uh to my

342
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,720
little shopping spree um what

343
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,800
magnification of the glasses that you

344
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,160
normally wear and so I wanted to bring

345
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,839
them and actually take a test and see if

346
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,920
they work cuz if they don't work why are

347
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
we buying anything right I would love

348
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,079
that. Okay. Oh look at you're a good

349
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,920
sport. So any any 1.0's one and a

350
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,440
quarters. What are you? This looks fun.

351
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,279
Are you picking them cuz he picked them?

352
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,399
Well it matches my shirt too and because

353
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,040
he picked them. I was trying to match

354
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,399
her style. I wanted to match over here.

355
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,399
Now, the experiment to set it up, it's

356
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,360
it's a unorthodox experiment. We're

357
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,880
going to say that it works with Let's

358
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,720
dim the lights a little bit, everybody.

359
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:33,760
Oh. Um, welcome to Sha Eyes. Please zoom

360
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,839
in on this menu. Oh my god. Wow. Safe.

361
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,440
Oh, see, we're in. Yes, you. So, anybody

362
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,040
that has glasses, Michelle, I know

363
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,200
you're one of those people. It's dimly

364
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,320
lit. The writing is small. So, I'd like

365
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,560
to test if those cheaters are actually

366
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,680
worthy of the purchase. Doc, would you

367
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,279
like to have her read something off the

368
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,360
menu? Maybe the entree play. Okay.

369
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,320
There's a kale salad for an appetizer

370
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,519
with balsamic vinegrett. Massaged kale

371
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,519
with kale shavings. Shredded kale. Kale

372
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,040
salad with balsamic. This is all the

373
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,279
same thing. You're only getting kale at

374
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,560
this restaurant. This is a health show.

375
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,200
But you passed.

376
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,760
So, are they safe though? They So,

377
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,920
here's the here's the big uh kind of uh

378
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,639
small print. They are safe if you have

379
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,320
the same u magnification requirement in

380
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,200
both your eyes. So, making sense. So,

381
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,959
dollar store glasses, reading glasses.

382
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,560
They're a pick. They're a pick with the

383
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,240
same ramification.

384
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,240
Thank you. Thank you. We'll sign this

385
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,320
for you. Oh, what would the Next up,

386
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,600
dollar store coffee filters. You were so

387
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,920
excited when you saw these in your

388
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,320
store. Now, you actually love these.

389
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,880
Yeah. Well, ear muffs. But I coffee all

390
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,079
day for me. Okay. All day long. I I love

391
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,920
it. I like the way it tastes. I like

392
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,920
being social with it. So for me, coffee

393
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,120
filters are a staple in my household

394
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,720
that I kind of can't go through the day

395
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,399
without. So for all the work that you've

396
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,560
done, I want to gift these to you. It's

397
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,560
it's really the least I could do. It's

398
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,639
the absolute least. Just so generous and

399
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,880
thoughtful and what a good person.

400
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,639
