00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,830
footage from a real medical procedure.

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,540
So see all this? Mhm. This is all fungal

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,320
debris. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,880
Do you see that?

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,840
Yeah, you're all a little bit unsettled

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,520
now. First you told me, right? First you

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
told me you couldn't get enough of

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,600
pimple popping, and now we've taken it

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
to a whole new level cuz that was not

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,480
pimples that were being popped. These

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,559
are some of the videos the internet

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,960
cannot seem to get enough of. They're

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,320
from the foot specialist known as the

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,160
toe bro. He's a sensation and he says

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,320
there is nothing he won't clip, slice,

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,559
or scoop off your feet. Jonathan Tinto,

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
also known as the toe bro, is here to

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,799
reveal the number one thing everyone

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,240
needs to stop doing to their feet so

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
they don't end up looking like this.

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,000
Look at this. You don't want to look

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,920
like this, right? That that's an ingrain

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,240
ingrown nail being whacked out, which we

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,040
have to do sometimes. So, why are you so

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,680
passionate about foot health? My dad was

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,119
a foot specialist for over 30 years. So,

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,119
as a kid, I've been going to work with

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,400
him since a little boy. And in my

33
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,000
summer, if you can believe it, he made

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,000
me go to work. And my job was to take

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
off the shoes and socks for everybody.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,200
Oh. Oh, no gloves, no nothing. There's

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,200
dad. Hey, Dad. Look at that.

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,119
I hope he was good at taking your shoes

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,479
off with no that that's actually

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,840
sometimes a dangerous thing to do cuz

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,520
you see stuff when those socks come off

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,600
that you wish you hadn't. It It was

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,280
raining on me. That's right. It was It

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,240
was tough. But when I finished school

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,600
and I got to see how important feet are.

46
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,119
And really, people don't realize how

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,200
important feet are until something

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,479
happens. So, what's the number one thing

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,399
you say we're all doing wrong with our

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,000
feet? just going to tempt us here. I

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,439
think it's cutting our toenails. A lot

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
of people don't know what's the right

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,439
way or how they should be cutting their

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,040
toenails. So, um whether you do it

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,719
yourself or you go for a pedicure, you

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
could be trimming them wrong. And when

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,000
you trim them wrong, you have a high

58
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,319
risk of getting an ingrown toenail. All

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,200
right. So, the toe bro filmed someone

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,239
who let their toenails grow a little too

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,710
long for about 2

62
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:31,969
years. Take a look.

63
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:31,969
[Music]

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,200
I mean, that video goes on and on. I've

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,920
always wondered, how long should our

66
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,360
nails be? Well, the one thing you you

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,800
want to make sure that you never leave a

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
sharp corner when you're cutting your

69
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
toenail. So, that's number one. Number

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
two, you you really don't want the nail

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,360
to go that long like that video. That

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640
could be really dangerous in your shoes.

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
So, what we always want to do is kind of

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
leave the nail just one or two

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
millimeters just above the edge of the

76
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,120
skin just to have a little bit of extra

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,160
nail, but obviously none of those three.

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,360
Come over, show us how to do this,

79
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,200
right? You got a little hack. Let's say

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
we have an ingrown toenail. Yes. What do

81
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,120
we do? Well, there's a few things you

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,599
can do. If that toe is really painful,

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
we can soak the foot in some Epsom salt

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,519
and warm water for around 15 minutes

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,760
twice a day for a few days. It's going

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,159
to help soften the skin, soften the nail

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,920
so it's not so tight and as painful.

88
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,840
then we can actually apply an overthe-c

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,280
counter antibiotic ointment to help

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,519
trying to prevent any sort of infection,

91
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
keep the area relatively clean. If

92
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,560
that's not working, if the pain's still

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,159
going on, then we can go for the big

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,480
guns. And that's trying to get some

95
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,480
cotton ball underneath the edge of the

96
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,159
nail and the skin to try to lift the

97
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,840
nail. Cotton ball is the big guns. Yeah,

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,640
it's the big gun. So So you roll it up.

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,519
Exactly. We'd make a thin little almost

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,239
thin little line like that. Yeah. Let me

101
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
see this one. Like that, I guess. Yep.

102
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,879
Just like that. even a little bit

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,159
thinner. You put it on the side of the

104
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,519
nail. I'll show you got a good one. You

105
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,440
put it on the side of the nail and you'd

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,560
actually push it underneath the nail to

107
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
raise it up. You show that to the camera

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,480
if you don't. So, put it like that. Can

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
you all see that side of the nail? Then

110
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,760
you take this thing. Yep. And you just

111
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,120
push it in like this. Exactly.

112
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,280
Underneath. And that's going to help

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,280
lift the nail so it's not going right

114
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,040
into the skin. The whole goal for us is

115
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
try to get that nail to not grow in the

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,640
skin and be above the skin. Dad, you

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,160
proud of him? Yes, sir. He is. You did a

118
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,079
good job. Thank All right, up next. Have

119
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,759
you ever experienced dry, burning,

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,479
cracked heels that look like this? Take

121
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,800
a look. Yes, yes, yes. That could be one

122
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,320
of your feet. The toe bro has an easy at

123
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,320
home trick that anyone can do to

124
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,320
alleviate these cringe-worthy cracks. So

125
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,840
stay with us. I am back with Instagram

126
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,960
sensation, the toe bro,

127
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,320
Jonathan. Before the show, applaud

128
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,240
because he's going places we've never

129
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,479
gone before. Before the show, the toe

130
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,800
bro scoured our audience for the driest

131
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,240
and most cracked heels with our foot

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,759
cam. There it is. the foot cam looking

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,639
looking looking and guess what we found?

134
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,880
We found these feet. Whose feet are

135
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,479
these

136
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,120
feet? Come on now. I know who it is. If

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,600
you won't tell me, I'll tell you. This

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,320
is

139
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,320
Janelle. Janelle, my

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,400
dear. So, how your heels feeling right

now? Really dry, doctor. Very dry.

142
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,680
Little itchy.

143
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
Is there anyone you want to kick with

144
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600

look at them. Just take a look. Well, I

147
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
think hold a second. Well, they are a

148
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,560
little dry, but maybe we should turn to

149
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,360
the person who turned you in. Avery,

150
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,960
come on up here. Tiger. Thank you. I

151
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520

154
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,080
says quite he goes. I'm I'm really

155
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,280
sorry. So, what does Janelle's feet feel

156
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,759
like to you? What what bothers you about

157
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,280
them? Well, sometime. Well, she she

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,960
complains all the time. And because I

159
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,600
love feet, like I have like a little

160
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,680
miniature foot fetish. Not not like a

161
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,120
creepy one, but a a good one. I just

162
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,680
like them cute. I just like them cute,

163
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,280
that's all. So, you know, um 2 3 days

164
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,759
after she come from the from the nail

165
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,720
salon getting a

166
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,000
pedicure, like, "Babe, what happened?"

167
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,520
She like, "I don't know. I forgot to put

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,240
lotion on." I'm like, "But you just got

169
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,600
them done, you know." So, but they do

170
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,160
feel like the um the horse out of

171
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,880
velcro.

172
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,680
You're in worst trouble I can imagine.

173
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,440
To bro, come on over here. Why Why is it

174
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,800
we get cracks on our feet? So, I've got

175
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,720
this is I guess this is normal skin.

176
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
Yeah. There's two reasons why. Number

177
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,280
one, think of skin as an elastic band.

178
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,960
So, when you have a nice fresh elastic

179
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,360
band, you know, the skin's properly

180
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,440
moisturized, it can stretch. No problem.

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
That's what we want skin to do. But if

182
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,280
you have skin that's dry that you're not

183
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
moisturizing properly, when you put some

184
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,840
tension on it, it can snap. That's how I

185
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
feel. That's the big issue. So, we have

186
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,520
to make sure the skin is properly

187
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,520
moisturized. The second reason is

188
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,440
pressure. It's pressure that's causing

189
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,720
that skin to expand. And if it's dry,

190
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,560
it's just going to crack. But you've

191
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,880
come to the right place cuz Toe Bro has

192
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,400
a hack for you. Come on over, guys. You

193
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,479
might as well join us. You see how that

194
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,240
that elastic band snaps? Trouble. Yeah,

195
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,000
she might do that to you. Snap on you.

196
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,360
All right. So, have a seat here. What

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,360
can Janelle and everyone else do who

198
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,440
wants to get rid of their their cracked

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,680
heels? The big thing that we can do, we

200
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,520
can actually make a little homemade uh

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,759
foot soak to help soften some of that

202
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,840
hard feet in there. Yeah. So, what we're

203
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,280
doing is just a cup of vinegar, a cup of

204
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,759
mouthwash, and warm water. And

205
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,039
mouthwash. Mouthwash. So, this is going

206
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,199
to help soften the skin. And we're going

207
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,800
to do that for around 15 minutes. And

208
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
then after that, the puma stone. Get to

209
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,240
work. Hey, come on, Mr. Foot Fetish.

210
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,319
Let's go. Come on now. Not the creepy

211
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,319
kind. Not the creepy kind of foot

212
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,160
fetish. The good kind of foot fetish.

213
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,599
So, what I really want you to do after

214
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,360
those heels are nice and soft, you're

215
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,520
going to grab that foot like you like

216
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,000
it. There you

217
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,199
go. Get that pummelone to the dry skin.

218
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,039
And come on, you're a big guy. Put some

219
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,880
muscle in there. There you go. But what

220
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,800
you want to do is not too hard. Not too

221
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,800
hard. You don't want to damage the skin.

222
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,720
Thank you for being part of this. Toe

223
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,680

proud, too, which is probably the

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,560
greatest honor of all. Good for you.
