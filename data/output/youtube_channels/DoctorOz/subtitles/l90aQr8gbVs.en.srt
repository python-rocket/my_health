00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,560
[Applause]

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,040
All right, I want to take a look at this

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,400
package of powder. Just simple old

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,360
powder. It's a new product. It's called

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,360
Palcohol that promises to turn

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,440
water into wine. Well, actually, not

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,119
wine. It's in vodka and rum, lots of

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,119
other fun things like that. It's

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,840
approved for sale starting the summer,

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,960
but Palcohol is causing a media frenzy.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,880
Palcohol, a cocktail in a powder. It's

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,239
creating quite a buzz and everybody's

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,640
got an opinion. But not everyone agrees.

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,800
Critics call the powdered booze risky

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
and an accident waiting to happen. And

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,360
that's the concern. Although created for

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,280
adults, could palcohol attract kids and

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,760
lead to binge drinking or worse,

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,079
snorting or injecting it? It's dangerous

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,000
stuff and it shouldn't be allowed to be

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,800
sold. And what about sneaking it into

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,039
movie theater, stadiums, and schools?

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,039
Some states have already banned Palcohol

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,199
and others are considering it. With

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,160
liquid alcohol the most abused drug in

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,400
the US, could powdered alcohol be next.

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,920
Today, everything you need to know about

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,920
Palcohol. So today, your top questions

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
about Palcohol. And here to answer, Mark

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,560
Phillips. He's the creator of Palcohol

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,560
and physician Dr. Yale Varnado, who's

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,159
been researching the product. So what's

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,439
the point of powdered alcohol? Why did

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,840
you create it in the first place? Well,

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,880
I did it because I moved to Arizona and

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
I was doing outdoor activities that uh I

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,479
thought it would be nice to bring some

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,960
alcohol along when I finished with the

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,119
activity to relax like biking,

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,119
backpacking, hiking, stuff like that.

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,520
And so that's why I came up with it. But

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,119
what the real issue about Palcohol is

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,600
not just using for recreational

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,840
activities. It's all the innovative uses

45
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
that can be done in other businesses.

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,000
Once the public found out about the

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,680
product, a medical professionals called

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,600
me and said, "We'd love to use this

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,840
product for antiseptic, powdered

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,840
antiseptic." So when doctors go into

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,159
remote locations or disaster relief,

52
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,079
they have to lug in liquid antiseptic,

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,320
which is very heavy. Now they can bring

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,159
powdered antiseptic in, much lighter,

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,920
and can treat more patients. I see the

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,239
potential side benefits, but at its very

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,759
core, it's a way of allowing people to

58
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,680
carry alcohol around, whether for

59
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,599
drinking or other purposes uh

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,959
effortlessly. if you don't mind, show me

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,920
what it is and how it works so people

62
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,120
get a better idea. Again, it's not

63
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,959
available until the summer, but when it

64
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,040
comes available, it's going to be a big

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,640
big deal. So, this is like obviously a

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,920
sample packet. The labels aren't there

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,920
yet and everything else, but this is

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,599
about the size of the packet, 4 in x 6

69
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,760
in the powdered and there's this

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,080
powdered vodka in here right now. So,

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,160
now you pour the water in there. Now,

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,080
this is vodka. You wouldn't be mixing

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,840
water with vodka and you're going to get

74
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,920
water vodka right now. This will be

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,920
unpleasant tasting. You would typically

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,800
mi mix orange juice or a soda with the

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,599
vodka or if you do add water, you'd add

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,200
some kind of flavored powder to make it

79
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,400
any flavor you want. So, it's a mixed

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,000
drink when you're done. Yes, it's a

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,920
mixed drink. So, you zip it shut and you

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,159
shake it and generally about 30 seconds,

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,720
but we'll just take it about 15. Then,

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,000
you open it up and I gave you a straw

85
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,000
here so you can uh try it and put it in

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
there.

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,640
vodka

88
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,840
water. But but it does taste like vodka.

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,680
But it's vodka. There's no question

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
about it's vodka. That's right. I'll

91
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
keep sipping this while you talk. Okay,

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,360
that's right.

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Yeah, it is remarkable. I wonder why

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
it's never done before. What? Give me

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,720
the the the broader background. How many

96
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,959
flavors does it come in? So, there's

97
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,680
four approved uh versions right now.

98
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,760
Powdered rum, powdered vodka, and then

99
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,400
two cocktail flavors. Cosmopolitan and

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,480
powderita. Our word for margarita. Lemon

101
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,319
drop should be coming along soon. With

102
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,319
the cocktail versions, you just add

103
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,159
water and you have a drink. And the

104
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,959
calorie count about 80 calories a

105
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,480
package. So far so good. Most people

106
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,680
they say, you know, maybe I'll see

107
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,840
what's that's why I think there's been

108
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,680
so much of an attention on this. But Dr.

109
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,239
Bernardo, some states have already

110
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,200
banned this product, banned it. And

111
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,480
there are many others that are

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
following. Here's a map of the ones that

113
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,120
have actually gotten rid of them. What's

114
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,640
the concern? Why is everyone worried? So

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,760
the concern really is, and you'd

116
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
mentioned, why hasn't this been done

117
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,200
before? People have actually been

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,519
looking at ways to make powdered or

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
crystallized alcohol since the 70s. So,

120
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,080
you know, when I first thought about

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
this or heard about this, I said, well,

122
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
you know, we always say in medicine, if

123
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
someone's attempted it before and you

124
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,199
know, it fell to the wayside, what was

125
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,800
the reason for it? Is it not safe? Are

126
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,199
there risks and that we just don't know

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,919
about? So, from the medical perspective,

128
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
being an advocate for the consumer, I am

129
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,479
concerned about what are the ways that

130
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,759
people might abuse it or misuse it. you

131
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,600
know, when people are coming into the

132
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,160
hospital, how could they pro perhaps be

133
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,320
intoxicated in a way that I don't know

134
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,759
how to fix because I don't actually know

135
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,560
what's in this product. There's more

136
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,479
than just dehydrated alcohol in this.

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,919
You know, the FDA has actually even said

138
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,400
themselves when they reviewed it, they

139
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,080
didn't do any testing on it. Um, they do

140
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,919
know that there are other compounds in

141
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,800
it that we would find in processed

142
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,199
foods. And if you want to live clean and

143
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,720
you want to uh live a healthy lifestyle,

144
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,240
you might be worried about some of those

145
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,919
additives because we just don't know

146
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
what the long terms effect. Mark, what's

147
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,720
your reaction? I'm sure these are not

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,639
new concerns for you. Why is it that all

149
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,320
these states are banning your product?

150
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,639
Well, they're banning it because they're

151
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,280
ignorant about the product. Really? Uh

152
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,600
the FDA did look at it. The TTB has

153
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,919
reviewed it. It that's very safe.

154
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,080
There's nothing nothing unnatural in the

155
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,520
product. Uh the reason they're banning

156
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,400
is because they just don't understand

157
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,800
the situation. Liquid alcohol has been

158
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,800
abused. Still is. It's a terrible thing

159
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,000
in United States. Binge drinking,

160
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,639
underage drinking, alcoholism. But the

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,400
solution is not to ban liquid alcohol.

162
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,240
No one's calling for that. And nor

163
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,039
should the calling for a ban of powdered

164
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,039
alcohol. Once you ban powdered alcohol,

165
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,520
one, it creates a demand for it. A

166
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,000
heightened demand. We want what we can't

167
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,759
have. More people drank in prohibition

168
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,160
they did before prohibition. More people

169
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,400
abused alcohol in prohibition than

170
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,039
before. A concerned mother came to me

171
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,880
last week and said, "I'm for the banning

172
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,800
of your product and because I don't want

173
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,199
my 15-year-old daughter to get a hold of

174
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,080
it." And I asked her, "Which should be

175
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,600
easier for your daughter to buy,

176
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,080
marijuana or a bottle of vodka in a

177
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,120
liquor store?" Well, you know, she can't

178
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,560
buy a bottle of vodka in the liquor

179
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,919
store. They ask her for ID and that

180
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,680
won't happen. But she can walk right out

181
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,520
that door on the street and buy

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,680
marijuana easily because it's not

183
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,759
regulated. So to protect the underage

184
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,880
drinkers from getting hold of alcohol,

185
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,720
we regulate it. By banning it, we lose

186
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,400
all regulation. They'll be able to buy

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,840
it anywhere. There a lot of folks who

188
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,199
have questions about this. People are

189
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,560
here in our audience who believe this

190
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,000
might be good, might be bad. Let's hear

191
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,039
from these are questions about Paul that

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
I think make a lot of sense. We're going

193
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,319
to start off with a member of law

194
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,639
enforcement. Uh how are you? Officer

195
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
Officer Roberts is joining us. So, have

196
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,759
you seen this yet? I have. All right.

197
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,280
So, you you It smells like alcohol. You

198
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,680
can, you know, sort of interesting. This

199
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,600
been doable. What What's your question?

200
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,600
My question, I've been a police officer

201
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,360
for 15 years. I'm a DARE instructor with

202
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,039
the kids. I've seen the worst of the

203
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,440
worst when it came to both abusing drugs

204
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,680
and drinking of alcohol. Can this be

205
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,479
snorted as a powder form or can it be

206
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,440
broken down and injected into the blood

207
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,680
with as other drugs can be? as well as

208
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,759
can I, as a police officer, if that

209
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,160
happens, detect the odor of the alcohol

210
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,360
on someone's breath? Well, of course it

211
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
could be snorted. Anything can be

212
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,120
snorted. Any powder can. Even liquids

213
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,520
can be snorted. It would take you about

214
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,560
one hour to snort this of pain and

215
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,680
misery to get this up your nose to equal

216
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,160
one drink. Or someone could just do

217
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,840
this.

218
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,720
Whoa.

219
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,599
I think that we know. Wow. That wasn't

220
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,960
water. There was no vodka.

221
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,160
But the the concern that I have

222
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,120
less it's going to become less of a

223
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,880
debate in a moment. The concern that I

224
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,639
have as a physician is I know that you

225
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,479
say no one would want to invest the time

226
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,319
in snorting this, but we're seeing kids

227
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,919
like on YouTube dousing themselves with

228
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
alcohol, setting themselves on fire,

229
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,960
doing doing the cinnamon challenge. Why

230
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,039
wouldn't someone want to put themselves

231
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,360
on YouTube snorting this? I mean, it's

232
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,720
absolutely possible, you know, and we

233
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,479
don't know what's in it. So, I mean, you

234
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,800
said it's all natural, but the FDA

235
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,479
hasn't done actual research and studies.

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
Have you guys actually conducted any

237
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,319
clinical trials on it? I mean, I'd like

238
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,639
to know what it is that you have mixed

239
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,280
in with this so that I know what I'm

240
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,599
ingesting. The FDA knows exactly what's

241
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,879
in this. Okay, we have to know. It's

242
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,960
proprietary. But we they have to know

243
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
that I I'm required to present to the

244
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,719
government and to the FDA. They know

245
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,080
exactly what's in it, and there's

246
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,320
nothing dangerous. And they've said

247
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,839
that. So, we don't know of yet. Well,

248
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,279
it's it's uh I'm going to move it

249
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,560
forward only because I I'm sure there's

250
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,919
going to be questions around that, but

251
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,000
the fundamental question the officer is

252
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,519
asking is whether or not kids will store

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,720
it. I'm I'm getting the idea they won't,

254
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,160
but they're probably going to misuse it

255
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,080
in other ways. Thank you. Thank you. At

256
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,800
least is a mother of two two teenage

257
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,320
daughters. Correct. Go ahead. So, I have

258
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,720
a lot of concerns about your product

259
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,959
being a mom of teens. Um I think it has

260
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,000
a tremendous amount of kid appeal, the

261
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,839
name, the packaging, the form. It looks

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,040
like a package of Fun Dip or a juice

263
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,959
pouch. Um,

264
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,399
first question is, do you have kids? And

265
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,000
my other question is, don't you feel

266
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,000
that a new, more convenient form of

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,160
alcohol will make it easier for them to

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,480
sneak it into schools, movies, and other

269
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,760
places? I don't have kids, but I was a

270
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,839
first grade teacher. My degree is in

271
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,839
elementary ed, and I have a passion for

272
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,640
kids, so I'm very concerned about that.

273
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:31,680
As far as sneaking it in, this

274
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,000
is one shot of vodka. And you can see

275
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,959
compared to that package, this is about

276
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,360
1/4 the size of that package. That's one

277
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,560
shot of vodka in that package. It's much

278
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,360
easier to sneak in liquid alcohol

279
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,519
anywhere than powdered alcohol. So the

280
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,720
idea that powdered alcohol is easier to

281
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,360
conceal is a falsehood. That's not true.

282
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,720
So how is it more appealing to kids?

283
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,640
It's not. The flavors are not sweet. It

284
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
costs four times more than liquid

285
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,279
alcohol. Typically, kids want cheap

286
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,680
alcohol to get drunk. They're not going

287
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,440
to pay for top shelf stuff. This is four

288
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,160
times more expensive. It's harder to

289
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,440
conceal. There's really nothing

290
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,680
appealing about it to kids, but parents

291
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
should still be keep alcohol away from

292
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,440
the kids' hands. Why are they, you know,

293
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
it won't be readily available to

294
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,640
underage drinkers? Thank you very much.

295
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
Let me finish with Aaron. He's a a

296
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,720
teacher, right? You're a assistant

297
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
principal. Assistant principal.

298
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,959
Assistant principal at the in New

299
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,160
Brunswick. Uh North Brunswick rather

300
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,720
North Brunswick High in New Jersey.

301
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,600
Right. That's big big rivalry. Go ahead.

302
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,920
Um I've been an educator as Dr. said for

303
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
about 20 years. I've seen a lot of

304
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,640
things and I know we're going to have to

305
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
do as educators. We're going to have to

306
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,920
get in front of this and start educating

307
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,240
the students. Um, we've been successful

308
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,079
doing that with PSAs, public service

309
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,399
announcements that deal with texting

310
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,959
while driving, driving under the

311
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,880
influence, and most recently bullying.

312
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,279
Um, my concern is, is this really going

313
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,160
to be the same potency as regular

314
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,279
alcohol? And secondly, is won't this

315
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,160
lead to more binge drinking or binge use

316
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,920
because it's a new portal for teenagers?

317
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,079
We don't legislate behavior. We educate

318
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,560
to change that. No matter what kind of

319
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,519
legislation we do, it will not stop

320
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,560
binge drinking, alcohol abuse, alcohol

321
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,240
misuse. We have to educate people. Uh I

322
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,839
don't think that this product is any

323
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,720
different than liquid alcohol. Certainly

324
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,839
not any any more dangerous or attractive

325
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,000
to people. It costs more than liquid

326
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,079
alcohol. So I don't think it will be

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,360
will be used by anyone for binge

328
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,680
drinking. It's much cheaper, much easier

329
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
to get drunk with liquid alcohol than it

330
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,079
is with powdered alcohol. So, I don't

331
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
see that appeal right there. Thanks for

332
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,800
being an educator. We do appreciate it.

333
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,959
There'll be lots more questions,

334
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,640
everyone. When this comes into play over

335
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,079
the summer and powdered alcohol hits

336
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,760
your shelves, we'll be following it

337
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,360
