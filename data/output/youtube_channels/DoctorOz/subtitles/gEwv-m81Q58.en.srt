00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,040
[Applause]

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,799
Are you exhausted every day even though

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,560
you try to get enough sleep and eat the

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,720
right foods? Well, it turns out your

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,559
favorite health foods may actually be

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,800
causing your fatigue. And one of these

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,719
sneaky sleepy foods is actually one of

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,039
my favorite snacks of all. My audience

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,400
doesn't know this, but earlier we had a

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,840
yawn cam to capture some unsuspecting

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,160
sleepy people. Take a look at these

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,519
yawners. Here's the audience. There they

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,400
are. Oh my goodness. Oh my. Oh my. There

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,160
they are. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,239
This is before the show in the holding

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,079
area. Well, they happen to be sitting

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,120
next to each other here. What happened

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,000
here? Are you tired? Oh, yes. Um, I

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,079
caught the 6:40 a.m. train and I haven't

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,960
eaten yet. So, I'm Yeah, I keep on

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,960
yawning. Same thing. And I had a half a

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,760
cup of fiber cereal for breakfast, which

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,000
has not really filled me up. So, we got

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,399
hunger, we got early awakening. Are you

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,879
big yawners in general?

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,640
When you when I start, I can't stop. How

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,960
about that? And you think you eat well

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
generally? Yeah, you do. Yes. All right.

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,560
Give me your names real quick. Carly.

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,920
Carly. Melanie. Carly and Melanie. I

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,760
want you to be part of my bite club

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,760
today. Okay. Awesome. There's a table

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,240
over here. I'm going to have you taste

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,680
solutions because I'm going to show you

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,280
some things you guys and others are

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,479
eating and drinking to get yourselves in

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,920
the right place. But actually, I'm doing

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,360
the opposite. All right. Sounds good.

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,360
Awesome. Let's see the bite table. Okay.

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,240
Let's bring in nutritionist JJ Smith to

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,080
unmask the biggest sneaky seepy foods.

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
The first one is what many would think

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,680
is your go-to onthe-go food. It's the

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,880
healthiest thing out there for most

45
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
people. It's your morning smoothie.

46
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,799
They're dominating the the country.

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,640
They're all over the place. But some

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,479
people, they just don't feel good. They

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,840
feel tired the rest of the day. Mhm.

50
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,560
Well, you know, I love green smoothies

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,040
for breakfast. However, when you buy

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,040
storebought or you kind of get a green

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
uh a smoothie on the go, you're going to

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,640
get a lot of additives. You're going to

55
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,840
get loaded sugar. I mean, let's look at

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,360
this one. It has 68 gram of sugar. Gosh,

57
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
this is pineapple juice. You know,

58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,200
that's just loaded with sugar. And when

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,000
you without the fiber? Yeah. Without the

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,320
fiber. And so when you drink a uh when

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
you drink a smoothie like this, it's

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,360
going to cause you to have energy dips.

63
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
You think you're getting all these

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
healthy nutrients, but you're getting a

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
lot of sugar and you won't feel

66
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,239
energized throughout the day. So, we put

67
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,879
it to the test. We actually did got a

68
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,720
timeline of a smoothie from one of our

69
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,319
viewers, Asha. We asked her to take a

70
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,760
photo diary of her energy throughout the

71
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,200
day. So, here she is drinking the

72
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,200
smoothie, right? Hot. Look at her.

73
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,440
Peppy, ready to go. Lots of energy

74
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,840
there. Then two hours later, with the

75
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,680
evidence, by the way. Right, she's ready

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,519
for a nap. Right. So, you're the queen

77
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,480
of smoothies. You You got more smoothies

78
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,840
up your sleeve than anyone I've ever

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,640
met. You know, I'm about that green

80
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,080
smoothie life. And so, I actually uh

81
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,560
pulled a recipe that is actually all

82
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,879
natural ingredients. It has low sugar

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,120
fruit. It has pears, which is only 19

84
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,280
grams of sugar. You're It's going to be

85
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,720
delightful, too. And it has, see the

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,200
difference with that one is this has

87
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,360
greens which will slow the absorption of

88
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,440
sugars. It has some mint. It has some

89
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,640
ginger. Is this water? Yes, that's

90
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,280
water. I was say it's just the the right

91
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,959
amount of sweetness, right? Not too

92
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,360
sweet, but just enough to give you

93
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,000
energy without causing you to have those

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
crashes because the ingredients,

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,760
particularly the fiber and the greens,

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040
will slow the absorption of sugars. So,

97
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,360
you'll stay, you know, you'll keep that

98
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,640
pep in your step all day long. Yeah. You

99
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,080
know, I've got my Spike Club members

100
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,120
over there. So, do you agree with me? Do

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
you think it's the right amount of

102
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,560
sweet? It's perfect.

103
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,480
Oh, yes. This mint, like, it's so light.

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
It's not like a regular smoothie. It

105
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
tanalize your taste buds without having

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
to explode sugar in your mouth because

107
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,480
you can do this all day long. Okay,

108
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,080
absolutely. Let's move on. Okay, next

109
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,599
sleepy, surprising food. Surprised

110
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,440
you've been made. Did not expect it.

111
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,879
Humus. I grew up with this stuff. I love

112
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,560
it. One of my favorite snacks of all

113
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,519
time. Surprise. And yet, it makes us

114
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,640
want to take a nap. Yeah. Well, hummus

115
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,599
um provides protein for energy, but not

116
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,319
as much as we think. And so when you're

117
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,040
eating uh hummus, you get um it also

118
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,760
provides elptophen. Yes. And what that

119
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,920
does is causes us to raise the levels of

120
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,439
melatonin in the bread in the brain,

121
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,439
which can make us feel sleepy. That's

122
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,599
what turkey has in it. Yeah. And think

123
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,920
about it, when we eat hummus, we often

124
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,079
use pretzels, we use pita bread, more

125
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,799
sleepy carbs that make us feel very

126
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,360
tired and sleepy. So you have a hat. I

127
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,680
got a better alternative, Dr. Oz. So

128
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,560
this is a very simple threeingredient

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,600
alternative. Greek yogurt,

130
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,400
peanut butter, and vanilla extract. And

131
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,360
when you combine these together,

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,360
right? You like Okay. This is like lick

133
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,600
your fingers good though, right? Very

134
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,600
good. It's a great alternative. I It's

135
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,560
surprising. Peanut butter and yogurt. I

136
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,880
don't know why we haven't done it

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,560
earlier. I know. is such a good protein

138
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,400
power punch that will help you stay

139
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
energized all day as well. Michael, keep

140
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,479
us honest. Your thoughts on this? It's

141
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,080
like a fluff nutter. I love it. I love

142
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,560
fluffern nutter. It's like fluff nutter.

143
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,479
Did I hear love? They love it. Yeah,

144
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,199
this is my favorite. Definitely. It's

145
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,759
light and I I just love that it kind of

146
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,320
tastes like a cream cheese because it's

147
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,000
so like light, but it's lighter. The

148
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,759
texture, the mouth feels light. I love

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,440
All right, next got a seafood here that

150
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,360
a lot of people think is it's part of

151
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,280
their their foundation for health is

152
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,880
tuna fish. How's that possible? It's

153
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,600
another food with with tryptophan in it.

154
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,400
Yeah, I know. And also eating tuna, it

155
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,199
has high amounts of vitamin B6 which

156
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,039
will all also cause us to produce

157
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,520
melatonin. Yeah. So, if you're going to

158
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,120
do tuna as a protein punch, you got to

159
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,039
do some lettuce wraps. Looks how look

160
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
how divine this looks, right? But when

161
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,120
you use lettuce wraps, it's a much

162
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
better alternative. Fight Club. What do

163
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,600
you guys think of these things? I love

164
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
the combination of the tuna and the

165
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
lettuce. I need a good way to put those

166
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,720
two together. Very light. It's perfect.

167
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,000
And this is crunchy. Like I feel

168
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,600
something crunchy in there and that

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,320
makes it so good. We love crunchy.

170
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,320
What's your favorite one so far?

171
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,720
Oh, like this. I like the tuna in there.

172
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,120
Tuna lettuce. Yeah. Ah, it's it's it's a

173
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,600
tie. But this this has got pear in it,

174
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,240
right? Yes. Well, Dr. Oz, it is very

175
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,720
good. I can tell you that. It's a minty

176
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,080
pear power smoothie. You know what? I'm

177
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
gonna take the Greek yogurt with the

178
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,240

195
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,560
Question number one. When I wake up in

196
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,880
the morning, I feel Well, do you feel

197
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,199
like you need to be dragged out of bed

198
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,039
or you're like a zombie? Right. These

199
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,280
are the bees. And if you're a C, you're

200
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,960
look at this. You're so perked up.

201
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,240
You're ready to go. Don't you hate

202
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,520
people like that? I do. Right. All

203
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,400
right. So, those are the three options.

204
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,800
Okay, JJ. Next question. Okay, question

205
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,199
number two. During the afternoon, I am

206
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,400
Are you a starting to gain momentum?

207
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,280
Remember, you couldn't get out of bed in

208
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,479
the beginning. You had the pillows over

209
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,520
your head. Now you sort of get you're

210
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,680
going. The A's feel that way. The B's,

211
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,440
you're still like a zombie, right? I

212
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
spar you the picture this time. And the

213
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,199
C's, you know, you were so tripper early

214
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,800
in the morning, but you now you're

215
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,720
exhausted. Someone tucked me into bed

216
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,720
already. That's how you feel. All right,

217
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,680
last question in the quiz. It is JJ.

218
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,160
Question number three. In the evening,

219
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,240
when I look back on my day, my energy

220
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,840
looks like A, an airplane. Take it off.

221
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,120
It started slow, right, in the morning.

222
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,319
Couldn't get out of bed, but right now

223
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,440
you're picking up speed. You're going to

224
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,720
keep going. Or are you B,

225
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,919
the zombie? You're still the zombie.

226
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,039
You've been the zombie the whole darn

227
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,960
day, right? Or C, your phone battery,

228
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,319
right? It's like that's like you. It was

229
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,560
100% in the morning when you got up,

230
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,160
chipper, ready to go. But now in the

231
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
evening, it's down to 5%. you getting

232
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,520
alarms and you know people aren't happy

233
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,960
with you, right? So, tally up your

234
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,960
letters, A's, B's or C's. Okay, JJ, you

235
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,639
got solutions for us for the A's. Mostly

236
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,319
A's out there. These are the slow to

237
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,639
rise people, right? What do they ought

238
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,800
to do? Okay, the mostly A's. These are

239
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,960
the people who need a boost first thing

240
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,039
in the morning as soon as they wake up.

241
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,599
So, what we have for them is the Green

242
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,960
Monster morning shot. Oh, I like that.

243
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,960
You like it? Yes. And remember, these

244
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,680
are two ingredients. So, it's simply

245
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,560
matcha powder and almond milk. What

246
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,360
we're going to do is basically pour some

247
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,039
almond milk. Okay. We're going to put

248
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,760
some almond milk. You're going to put in

249
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,839
the matcha powder. And this is a little

250
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,000
martini glass. How many people know

251
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,839
about martinis?

252
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,560
And you just basically mix it up like

253
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,720
this. I I can see you doing martini. So,

254
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,080
over the shoulder like this, right?

255
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
Stir. You don't want to get too cute

256
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,240
with it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

257
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,160
And then basically you pour it and you

258
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,440
know you turn up. You drink it like a

259
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,920
shot just like you would a shot

260
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,240
anywhere.

261
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,399
Where's the a mostly a I want to have a

262
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,760
mostly a come on down lady in blue. Come

263
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,120
on down. Now I you you identify with

264
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,320
A's? I do. All right. You want to taste

265
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
this with me? I would love to. We're

266
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,160
going to do it in our own unique way

267
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,959
though. We're going to do it with a

268
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,959
shotski. Are you ready? Okay. Don't

269
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,000
spill this. Don't spill it. No. You got

270
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,120
it. On on three. One. Got to drink the

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
whole thing. Okay. Okay. Have you ever

272
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,800
done this before? No. All right. You

273
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,080
break? I I'm not admitting to it. Are

274
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,480
you awake yet? You're one of the eight.

275
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,480
No, I need this apparently. One, two,

276
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
three.

277
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,040
Wow. Did you like it? Absolutely. You

278
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,680
taste the green tea a little bit. Taste

279
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,120
the green tea. It's refreshing. Nice. I

280
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,320
like it. And the coconut deserves the

281
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,240
deal. Well, she knows that. She's a

282
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,519
master with two ingredients. Makes it

283
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,120
fantastic. Here's a little gift from the

284
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,600
show. Oh, thank you so much. I'm

285
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,720
kidding. Oh, apparently. All right. Next

286
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,959
up, what if you're mostly bees? Do you

287
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,120
known as the zombies?

288
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,200
Zombies. What do you do? Okay, this the

289
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,640
mostly bees. They are basically have no

290
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
energy from the time they wake up all

291
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,200
day long. So, we have a very simple

292
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,399
twoingredient drink for them. It has

293
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,880
chia seeds and it has coconut water. And

294
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,560
so, it's a really nice drink where you

295
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,920
get the chia seeds and and I like

296
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,760
coconut water because it keeps us

297
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,519
hydrated all throughout the day. So,

298
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,880
this is a fun one to drink as well. I

299
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,279
think it's brilliant. It'll also soothe

300
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,760
some of the angst of the zombies. Yes,

301
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,600
that's a great idea. Next, let's talk

302
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,920
about the seas. These are the people who

303
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,920
burn brightly but briefly. Yeah, the

304
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,079
mostly seas. Okay, you know, they're the

305
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,839
ones that need a little boost in the

306
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,320
afternoon. 2 3:00. How many people need

307
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,360
a nap? Those are the seas. So, what we

308
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,399
have for them is the flying inner bee

309
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,279
drink. And this is inner bee. This is

310
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,880
simply iced ginger tea and honey. What's

311
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,800
that? How can I see who are the seeds

312
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,600
out there? Where are seeds? You keep

313
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,320
talking over there, J. Why I like this

314
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,240
drink? It has ginger tea in it. And what

315
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
ginger is going to do is reduce

316
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,399
inflammation, but it's going to improve

317
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
blood circulation. It's going to improve

318
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,200
your blood sugar levels, keep you very

319
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,279
energized. And how about the honey? The

320
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,279
honey is going to have fructose. And

321
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,160
when you have fructose, it gives you

322
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,079
that boost of energy right away. We do

323
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,720
we have happy customers here? People

324
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,560
taste like them. Yes. Yes. Well, they

325
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,160
use them all up and they're happy. All

326
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,560
