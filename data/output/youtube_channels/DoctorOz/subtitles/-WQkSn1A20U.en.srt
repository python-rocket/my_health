1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,359
Howie Mandel has been making us laugh as

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,000
a comedian and entertainer for the past

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,519
40 years and he has never ever been in

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
more demand. He's starring in two,

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,519
that's right, two big series right now,

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,759
America's Got Talent and Deal or No

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,199
Deal. But behind the laughs, how he has

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,119
dealt with some serious health issues,

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,720
including a heart procedure that saved

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,199
his life. And he's here today to talk

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,199
about it all. How Mandel come on out

12
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,599
here. Wow.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,440
[Applause]

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,040
There you

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,360
go. Thank you. Thank you. Wow.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,480
Wow. That's a That's a trip. I know.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,640
That's a trip. They couldn't make a

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,200
closer door.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,120
This This was a set of a soap opera way

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,399
back when, right? And so it is actually

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,399
the longest squawk in network

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,239
television. We are told it is. I would

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,600
have got sponsors and raised some money

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,039
had I known I was going to be walking

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,399
this. It's sort of like a stress test. I

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,079
can see if you're up with the interview.

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,920
How am I doing? Am I okay down there? So

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
good. Once you you walk around, you

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
first of all, these shows are so much

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,680
fun. And I think, you know, Deal No Deal

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
is about enjoying life, but I think our

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,920
country can use that kind of I I say

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,280
first of all, Deal or No Deal is back

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,320
after 10 years on

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,040
CNBC and it is bigger and better.

36
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,680
Wednesdays 8:00 on CNBC are new

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,439
episodes. Don't miss it. But I think

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,960
that it is the ultimate escape. You

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,400
know, we don't talk about anything in

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,799
the news and you're watching real

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,640
people. It's mindless. It really, you

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,720
can be an idiot and be on our game.

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,680
There's no trivia. There's no physical

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,840
acumen. There's no skill. You just have

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,840
to say, "I want that one." And that's

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,920
all you have to say and answer one

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,399
question, deal or no deal. And it's

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,399
really it's really wonderful and

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,920
relatable to watch a real person and

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,360
maybe put yourself in that position.

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
People tell me they spend the whole

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,280
evening at the edge of their seat

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
screaming at the TV. It's very visceral

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,240
television and whether you're screaming

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,920
because you're happy or whether you're

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,920
screaming because you think they are an

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,680
idiot and you're saying no, but there's

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,840
in in the hour or the couple of hours

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,080
that you watch, there is crying, there

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,080
is fainting, there is laughter, every

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
emotion. It's the biggest emotional

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,879
roller coaster in television. It's Deal

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,920
or No Deal. Now, new back on CNBC.

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,680
Punching clawing and gnarling. But it's

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,959
hard to do a show when you're losing

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,440
some of your key characters. So, one of

67
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,879
your briefcase models defected. Megan

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,599
Markle went off and got married to

69
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,800
Prince Harry. You call that a defection?

70
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,959
Well, I'm just going to The fact that

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,959
she left this country and became royalty

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,319
someplace else. No, she left your show

73
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,280
and became royalty somewhere else.

74
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,280
That's what my show does. My

75
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,920
show Why do you laugh? You laugh because

76
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
you're not on my show. If you're on my

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,959
show, you don't know what You'll either

78
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,360
walk out of there with a million

79
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,200
dollars. You could walk out a princess,

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,640
you can walk out a television star.

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Chrissy Tegan is also from our show. And

82
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,879
uh we have had so many people. Hillary

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,400
Clinton number 17 from the first scene.

84
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,840
Yes. You don't you don't remember? Of

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,120
course. What do you remember about

86
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,319
working with Megan? And just out of

87
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,159
curiosity, were you invited to the

88
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,879
wedding? I was not invited to the

89
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:11,440
wedding, but don't get mad. I went and

90
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:13,599
uh I was not allowed in the building and

91
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,000
I uh what do I remember? I'm going to be

92
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,120
totally honest with you. Nothing. I

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,800
don't remember Megan. I don't. when she

94
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,879
uh got the you see this picture that

95
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,280
you're looking at right now. I saw that

96
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,200
picture when she became the Dutch or

97
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,239
when she got engaged. Yes. And I saw

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,319
that picture and they went she was a

99
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,680
deal or no deal ma and I go really

100
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,440
really what number? And then that

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
picture put up that picture again cuz I

102
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,239
was trying to remember what number was

103
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,920
she? There's no number even on her case.

104
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,640
So how do you know she was actually a

105
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,720
model? I think she's just a young lady

106
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,720
with a lot of baggage and you know that

107
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,680
Too good. No, she's a wonderful,

108
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,599
beautiful young lady and I'm so happy

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
for her and all I want for each and

110
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,799
every person. They don't even have to be

111
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,159
on my show to be successful and healthy.

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,599
So, most folks respect you because

113
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,760
you're an incredibly talented comedian

114
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,760
and entertainer, but I respect you. I

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,640
respect you. I like It's not just about

116
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,560
looks. I know what you're going to say.

117
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,239
No. Shine you up. Exactly. The uh You're

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,519
honest. You tell the truth. And you

119
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,280
spoke about uh OCD at a time when people

120
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,479
just weren't talking about it. Yeah,

121
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,799
they were they weren't open. You know,

122
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,720
I'd like to say that I was uh open about

123
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,440
it, but I come from I'm I think I'm

124
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,840
older than you. I come from an age where

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,600
uh you know the stigma of having any

126
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,840
mental health issue. There's a stigma.

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,440
Yeah. And I didn't talk about it and I

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,040
was diagnosed with OCD and I've talked

129
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,639
about this before and I I did a book and

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,280
I I talked about it in my book. You

131
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,320
know, uh one of just one of the tiny

132
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,759
little things with my OCD is is touching

133
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,759
certain things. And I remember I was on

134
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,800
the Howard Stern show this about 20 25

135
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,680
years ago and uh contamination in that

136
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,520
studio. Yeah, there was, you know, and

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,199
that studio in particular, I feel like

138
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,120
this is hermetically sealed and

139
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,759
everybody here has been washed. But the

140
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,840
thing is that I was going to leave and I

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
was wearing short sleeve t-shirt and so

142
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,080
I couldn't pull down my sleeves and I

143
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,280
said, you know, I don't want to touch

144
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
the door. Can somebody open the door?

145
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,759
And they thought it was kind of funny.

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,199
They go, no, you touch the door. And I

147
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,400
go, no, I don't want to touch the door.

148
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,320
And they said, you touch the door. And I

149
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,759
went to grab a tissue and they pulled

150
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,000
the tissue away and they were having fun

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,919
with me. But the truth is, because

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,440
people think cuz I'm a comedian, they

153
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,199
thought I was joking. And I started

154
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,880
having an anxiety attack, which feels

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,759
like a heart attack. And I said, and

156
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,800
then in the in in my panic, I said,

157
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,160
Howard, seriously, I go to a doctor and

158
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,840
I'm uh I have OCD and I see a

159
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,280
psychiatrist and I feel like I'm going

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,039
to die right now. You got to please, you

161
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,960
got to let me out. And he opened the

162
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,400
door. They saw the the reality. And when

163
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
the door opened, I got to the other

164
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
side. I could still hear the broadcast

165
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,680
from inside the studio. And I had no

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,039
idea. I thought I was on a break. Oh my

167
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,720
goodness. So that's what I thought. I

168
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,440
thought, "Oh my god, I just said that

169
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,919
publicly on national radio." So, number

170
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,639
one, I thought, "My poor family has I,

171
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,360
you know, I outed myself as, you know, a

172
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,960
mentally unstable person that how are my

173
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,919
kids going to be able to go to school? I

174
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,080
mean, they're going to it's going to be

175
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,080
horrible. Number one. Number two, my

176
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,400
career is over because who's going to

177
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,680
hire any show cost millions of dollars?

178
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
Who's going to hire somebody who has

179
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
mental health issues?" And remember,

180
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,479
this is 25 years ago and it was the

181
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,400
darkest day of my life. And I thought,

182
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,319
"This is it. What do I do?" And I just

183
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,479
going to I got to end it. I got to run

184
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,160
into traffic. I'm in Manhattan. So I I

185
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,360
go downstairs. It's the busiest place in

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,919
the world. And I remember walking

187
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,560
through the uh glass doors onto a

188
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,000
teeming street of pedestrians and

189
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,440
traffic thinking, "This is it. I don't

190
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,280
know what to do. I've never felt lower

191
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,199
in my life." And just as I was doing it

192
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,120
in my periphery, somebody came up to me

193
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,880
and he said, "Are you Howy Mandel?" And

194
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
I said, "Yeah." And I I made no eye

195
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,080
contact. And and he said, "You know, I

196
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,560
just heard you in Howard Stern." I felt

197
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,400
my my heart drop into my stomach and I

198
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
thought, "This is it." And before I

199
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,759
could make a move, he said two words

200
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,120
which meant something very different

201
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,600
until now. But he went, "Me too." And I

202
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
went, "What?" And he goes, "Me too?" I

203
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,800
go I go, "What does that mean?" He goes,

204
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,840
"Me too. I I suffer from obsessive

205
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,360
compulsive dis disorder." And I went,

206
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,720
"Really?" He goes, "And it felt good to

207
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,479
hear somebody talk about it." And I

208
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,560
said, "Well, thank you." And that was

209
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,400
the first. Now, at this time, there was

210
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,759
no there maybe wasn't internet, but

211
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
nobody was emailing. Nobody was

212
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,880
tweeting. No, there was no social media.

213
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,680
When I got home, I started getting

214
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,280
letters from people to say, "Oh, that

215
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,120
was so great. We heard you." And then I

216
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,639
thought and it opened me up. And then I

217
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,720
thought like, "What am I hiding? And

218
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,800
what is the stigma?" And the truth is

219
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,120
that with all the proper help that I get

220
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,440
and all the love that I have, I am being

221
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,360
supported. I am functioning. I have a

222
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,240
beautiful family and it's ridiculous.

223
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,720
And I've made it my soap box. Yes. Good

224
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,720
for you. You know, I've I've

225
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,880
I've Thank you. I've made it my soapbox

226
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,880
to kind of remove the stigma from

227
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,639
anything, whether it be mental health,

228
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,000
and mental health is really people

229
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,440
should be taking care of it like they

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,599
take care of their dental health. You'll

231
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,360
take a, you know, a kid to a dentist

232
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,800
when nothing hurts and they get an X-ray

233
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,879
and they go, "Look, mom, no cavities."

234
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,160
But there's nobody talking to, it's not

235
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,240
part of our curriculum. There's nobody

236
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,319
talking to young people. all this stuff

237
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
that is happening in society today. I'm

238
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,440
sure there were red flags when there

239
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,360
were three and four and five, but

240
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,039
there's nothing in place to really take

241
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,680
care of that's the biggest issue is

242
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,759
mental health. And I believe and as an

243
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,360
MD and you can if you think I'm wrong,

244
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,960
you could tell me, but I think if we can

245
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,879
get our mental health strong, we can

246
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,319
help our physical health. I think two

247
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,840
people, if you cut into two different

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,759
people with their heart, I think if

249
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,759
somebody just doesn't have the right

250
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,000
frame of mind or coping skills, I think

251
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,000
their healing process is a lot tougher.

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So, um, you know, I'm a proponent. We

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,680
all need to just take care of our mental

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,560
health, talk about it, and remove the

255
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,080
stigma. Good for you. Thank you. It is

256
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,640
good for me. And you deserve the soap

257
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,839
boxes. Let me ask you just um, and I I I

258
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,120
didn't realize how profoundly it

259
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,399
affected you until you told that story.

260
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,080
But the idea that you would come out and

261
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
again look at a street and maybe throw

262
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,760
yourself into it because you thought you

263
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,200
destroyed your career. I destroyed my

264
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,279
family first. Your family first, even

265
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,040
more importantly. When was the worst for

266
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,440
you? You know, it's always a struggle

267
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,720
and I always need help and I always and

268
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
I tell people who struggle with it.

269
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,640
People say I have a little bit of OCD

270
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,320
because they're a little bit of a

271
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,360
germaphobe that. But when you really

272
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,600
have it, it stops you down. And there

273
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,000
are times when I could totally get

274
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,640
stopped down. I I'm not a doctor and I

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,839
don't uh really understand what's going

276
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,320
on. But I can't get past a a reoccurring

277
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,560
thought. I can't get past checking the

278
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,640
door. I'm my thoughts are and they make

279
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,480
no sense. I think I'm somewhat logical,

280
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,000
but and so I even understand more that

281
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,920
my thoughts aren't logical and I can't

282
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,519
get out. You know, everybody knows the

283
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,880
Howard Hughes story where he ended his

284
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,000
life in in a room alone naked, you know,

285
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,399
urinating into a bottle and not I

286
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,680
promise you that many times and probably

287
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,080
in the future I'm close to that, you

288
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,560
know, and and and the dichotomy between

289
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,480
feeling like that and knowing what my

290
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,320
career is doesn't make any sense. you

291
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
know, there's nobody that's, you know, I

292
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,839
didn't choose this career, but I'm I'm

293
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,320
thrilled by it and I'm, you know, I'm

294
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,040
out there, but this is not a comfortable

295
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,040
world for me, but it's worth it. So, how

296
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,399
do you interact with your family with I

297
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,440
mean, your wife, obviously, we have

298
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,800
beautiful picture of her, by the way,

299
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,640
and those, you know, my wife's right

300
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
here. There she is. No, my wife's in the

301
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,920
room. Oh, she's here. Where is she?

302
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,079
That's my wife right there. Oh, please.

303
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,480
Oh my goodness. She is right there. She

304
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,279
literally is right here. Yeah. I'm so

305
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,120
happy you're here. Yes. How do She's the

306
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,079
saint. She I've been married for 40

307
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,760
years. She is the

308
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,279
Well, here. Bring her out. Would you

309
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
come? Yeah. Yeah. Come on out. Come come

310
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,519
come come join us. She doesn't like to

311
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,920
be on. She's not even in our in our

312
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,839
wedding photos. Well, she's here now.

313
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,200
You might Someone can get me a hand mic.

314
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,240
Give me the hand mic if you don't mind.

315
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,920
Please have a seat. I'm going to ask you

316
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,480
this question if you don't mind. What is

317
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,399
it like? You don't have to leave. Oh, I

318
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,800
got You can go. No, you can go. She

319
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,040
loves you.

320
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,720
So So what what is it like? First of I

321
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,839
I'm you don't have to tell me anything

322
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
that's too personal. I don't want to

323
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,519
hurt either of you, but I am fascinated

324
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,880
that you have so much insight into your

325
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,399
OCD. I'm wondering what it's like being

326
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,240
in the family and working through this.

327
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,640
I mean, the visual of Howard Hughes is

328
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,440
painful. Oh, his humor gets him through

329
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,200
a lot of his issues. And I think the

330
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,600
laughter that we share together really

331
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
helps a lot. It does. And when he when

332
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
he gets too much into that and that he

333
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,680
starts bringing out that side of him,

334
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,160
then it can go away, too. So that really

335
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,920
helps our relationship and but she has

336
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,640
been the saint. This is the reason that

337
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm even alive today. I mean this is a

338
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,480
person that is

339
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,959
no but you have no idea what I had to

340
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,800
learn in therapy. You know when people

341
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,600
suffer from mental health issues the

342
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,040
first place you go is outside. So if if

343
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,160
it's OC it doesn't matter what it is.

344
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,519
And I don't think there's anybody alive

345
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,680
that doesn't have a mental health issue

346
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,360
and needs coping skill. And even if they

347
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,560
deal with you if you if they have I've

348
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,880
had friends a lot of friends who've had

349
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,399
open heart surgery. I've had uh you know

350
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,800
heart issues and maybe we'll talk about

351
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,800
that a little later. You know even to

352
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,120
cope with that to cope with you know

353
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,640
they say depression maybe sets in

354
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,800
because you have something traumatic

355
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,040
happen to your body. We are not given

356
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,600
coping skills. And what is happening is

357
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,680
she has been my coping skill. You know

358
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,360
she's the one that when I'm panicked or

359
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,959
when I can't go on or when I don't want

360
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,959
to do it anymore she's the my

361
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,680
cheerleader. She's also the one that is

362
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,000
very strong and forces me to get help

363
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,760
when I think I can do this myself. The

364
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,920
key is that we all got to talk about it.

365
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,279
We all got to accept it and we got to do

366
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,760
something about it. You know, there's a

367
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,720
t-shirt with an SH and it goes sh

368
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,079
happens and it does and you got to and

369
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,920
it's going to happen and it happens to

370
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,519
everybody and you just got to take care

371
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,519
of it and this young lady takes care of

372
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,480
me for the last 45 years. That's a love

373
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,000
