4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,519
Today, Tony Robbins is sharing his

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,960
secret to take back control of the

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:19,480
number one driver of stress, money.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,480
Please welcome my friend Tony Robbins.

00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,000

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,519
[Music]

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
How are you, brother? I I've never seen

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,199
you run before. That's so cool. Have a

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,199
seat. How are you all doing?

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,000
So, you know, I got to say just as as a

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,879
start, I I think emotional issues around

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,160
money are devastating. And frankly,

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,680
money's become as big a problem as

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
obesity and the epidemic we have with

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,120
that in America. I would love to get a

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
little bit of your insights about what

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,199
it is that is causing this financial

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,800
health crisis we have in America. Well,

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,559
I think most people don't realize, but

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,760
we know we get stressed from so many

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,960
things, but money is one of the deepest

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,960
ones. And I think it's because we feel

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,039
the least in control of money. I mean,

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
money is an expression of power in our

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,400
lives. You know, what we can and can't

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
do. And for many people, what's happened

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,119
for them is when they feel out of

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
control because it's so complex. Where

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,320
do I start? How do I go about it? I

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,760
don't know what to do. I'm so busy. What

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,280
happens is we end up starting to feel

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,439
that stress and we start to eat or some

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
people smoke or some people drink or it

37
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,560
starts to mess with your intimate

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,240
relationship and then everything gets

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
messed up and that all converts as you

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,680
know to physical stress which converts

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,280
to emotional and physical health. You've

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,560
taken Yeah. You've taken the last few

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,119
years of your life to write a book

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,799
called Money Master the Game. It's

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,479
absolutely fabulous book. Been a lot of

46
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,520
effort putting together these thoughts.

47
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,439
Why would you make that kind of

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,360
investment? Well, because you know, my

49
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,119
whole life, 37 years, I, you know, I've

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,159
been passionately obsessed with wanting

51
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,680
to know how do you help someone change

52
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,119
their life as quickly as possible? What

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
are the breakthroughs? And there's only

54
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,079
a few areas of your life that really

55
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,840
affect the quality of your life. Your

56
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,360
intimate relationships obviously do,

57
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,840
your physical body, as you and I both

58
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,920
know, your emotions, and then money. And

59
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,200
what I found is when 2008 happened, I

60
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,799
grew up in a really tough financial

61
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,240
environment. I went out to get the card,

62
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,759
it's gone. Not because somebody stole

63
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,840
it, because we didn't pay it for it,

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
somebody took it. No money for food. So

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
when I saw people losing their homes in

66
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,959
mass, when I saw people losing half

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,879
their net worth, and I knew it was based

68
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,720
on manipulation, it made me crazy. And I

69
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,480
have unique access. I've coached one of

70
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,319
the top 10 financial traders in the

71
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,400
world, a multi-billionaire for 21 years,

72
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,760
and he's never lost money in 21 years.

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
So, I thought if I could learn from him

74
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,760
and 50 other other best people in the

75
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,120
world and put in an action plan for a

76
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,319
millennial who just got out of college

77
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,000
and they still have debt and they don't

78
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,680
know what to do or a mom trying to

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
figure out how do I do this being a mom

80
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,959
and managing my life and my work and my

81
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,319
kids or somebody's trying to retire,

82
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,760
then I'd have a real gift and it took me

83
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,519
four years, but now I've got these seven

84
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,120
steps I can teach people. I want to take

85
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,800
advantage of the wisdom you have about

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,720
getting people to deal with their lives

87
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,400
proactively. So, it's right now folks

88
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
watching, they've got debt, they know

89
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
the money coming in is not going to be

90
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,519
as much as the money going out. How do

91
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,680
you alleviate the stress that they feel

92
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,040
this moment? They have to immediately

93
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,560
take action. They've got to put together

94
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,480
a plan. And I show them these seven

95
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,400
steps. But it starts quite frankly

96
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,080
inside your head. It starts with you

97
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
saying, "Okay, I'm going to stop telling

98
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
myself this story. Whenever I want to

99
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,720
help someone create a breakthrough in

100
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,319
anything, in their body, and their

101
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,319
relationships, and their money, there's

102
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,680
three S's I look at." Most people that

103
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,519
want to change their body look for a

104
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
strategy, a diet, something to do. And

105
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,640
that's great. But a lot of people have

106
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,319
the right strategy, but they don't

107
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,840
execute it. Or they never start because

108
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,680
they have a story in their head, a

109
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,519
belief that says, "I've tried

110
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,640
everything." Or, "I'm big boned." That

111
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,400
was mine, right? You know, I'm big

112
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,040
boned. I am big boned, but I'm 38 lbs

113
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
lighter than I was then. So, your story,

114
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,840
your limiting belief keeps you from

115
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,040
falling through. So, what you got to do

116
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
is you got to get yourself in a playful

117
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,760
place. I tell people, have you ever been

118
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,959
really angry at somebody and then

119
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,040
suddenly remember everything they've

120
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,480
ever done that pisses you off? Yes. Or

121
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
you're really in love and what's wrong

122
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,280
with life when you're totally in love?

123
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,200
Nothing. We're broke. Who cares? cuz

124
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,120
we're in love, right? So those three

125
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,120
S's, changing your state, changing your

126
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,200
story, and changing your strategy is how

127
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
you make a shift. I want to apply some

128
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,760
of your thoughts to real life

129
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,640
situations. That's okay. I've got some

130
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,840
audience members. So we're going to

131
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,400
start with Theresa. Come on over.

132
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,120
Perfect. Teresa, if you can join us.

133
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,720
There she is. All right. So meet Tony.

134
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,959
This is so quiet walking over here. You

135
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,640
can feel it. Let me turn you over here

136
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,080
so they can see all. So go ahead,

137
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,599
Teresa. Share your story. I'll get Tony

138
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,319
to work on it. Tony, I feel like I am a

139
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,920
hamster on a wheel. I live paycheck to

140
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,840
paycheck. I have twins who are in their

141
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,199
second year of college. My younger one

142
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,520
is going to college next year and I feel

143
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,919
trapped. I'm stressed and I never

144
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,199
pictured my life the way it is now. Are

145
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,759
you paying for your twins college

146
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
tuition? Yes, I am. So, um, easy for

147
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,639
someone on the outside to talk about it,

148
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
right? Because your physical stress and

149
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,440
emotional stress, I know, is real. But

150
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,120
if you really want to change it, then

151
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,040
you have to make some new choices. And

152
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,479
right now, the story you have, we all

153
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,160
are affected by the story we tell

154
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,919
ourselves. So we have metaphors. Some

155
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,280
people say, you know, I'm at the end of

156
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,560
my rope. And I'll go, okay, put it down

157
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
and come over here. And they look at me

158
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
like I'm crazy. Yours is I'm a hamster

159
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,280
on a wheel. And how many times do you

160
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,520
tell yourself that? Every day. Every

161
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,120
day. And so that's what you feel. See,

162
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,479
so whatever we tell ourselves, we

163
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,240
experience. So here's the truth. There's

164
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
a couple options for you. One of those

165
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
options is you have to understand that

166
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
you can still be financially free, but

167
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,520
somehow even though it seems impossible,

168
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,720
you got to take a small percentage of

169
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,360
what you have and pretend the government

170
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
put a tax on you. You'd hate that tax.

171
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
You'd swear you won't pay that tax, but

172
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,919
they'd still take the money. So, I'll

173
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,720
give you an example. There's a man named

174
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,199
Theodore Johnson. He worked for uh UPS.

175
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,639
He never made more than $14,000 in an

176
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
entire year in his life. That's the most

177
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,080
he ever made. At 70 years old, he's

178
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,600
worth $70 million. How is that possible?

179
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,199
I don't know. Yeah. How is that

180
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
possible?

181
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,759
I'll tell you when they asked Warren

182
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
Buffett, I asked him, "What made you the

183
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
richest man in the world?" He said,

184
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,680
"Living in America where there's

185
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,440
opportunity, good genes, so I lived a

186
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,720
long time." And compound interest. And

187
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,320
we've all heard of compound interest.

188
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,320
But what this man did is his friend said

189
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,520
to him, she said, "I can't save any

190
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,280
money. I have no money." Same as you're

191
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,479
feeling right now. And I know it's true.

192
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,759
You do have money. You're just not

193
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,360
putting it in the places that can get

194
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,479
you ahead. So that's why you're the

195
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
hamster on the wheel. And what his

196
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,759
friend said is, "We're going to take a

197
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,120
tax 20% of your money you're never going

198
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,560
to see, and it's going to go in this

199
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,560
investment account." And when over the

200
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,400
years it compounds and it's amazing what

201
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,160
it does. Second thing for you, I know

202
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,319
you're not going to like this one. What

203
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,440
if your twins had to actually pay for

204
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,759
some of that college education

205
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
themselves? So what I want you to do is

206
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,080
I want you to find no less than a

207
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,880
minimum of 10%. Okay, and as much

208
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,319
ideally as 15%. So if you will make that

209
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,840
promise, I will get someone to coach you

210
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,720
and get you to follow through. Promise.

211
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,720
Will you make it happen? And

212
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,960
[Applause]

213
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,000
we got one last victim for you, Tony.

214
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
For sure. Yeah. Hello. Hi. Hi. How you

215
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,080
doing? Should I come down? You stay

216
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
right there. You're about the right

217
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,280
height now. You're not evil now. Okay,

218
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,000
Tony. So, my issue is that I'm a mother

219
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,000
of three. I have three boys. And every

220
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
time I get my bills, my credit card

221
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,720
bills, anything like that, I just I just

222
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,160
leave them in the mailbox. I don't I

223
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,319
don't even take them out the mailbox

224
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
because it's just so stressful, all

225
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,639
these bills and you know, debt like

226
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,479
that. So, you know, what is the best

227
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,639
solution or what do you think is the

228
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,560
best solution? Well, I mean, I've been

229
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,199
hearing what you're you're saying about

230
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,639
saving percentage, you know, a piece of

231
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,479
your income every time. But it's, you

232
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,919
know, that's kind of really hard to

233
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,120
reach that goal when you have children

234
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,520
or other, you know, you know, limited

235
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,039
situations. So, how do you handle that?

236
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,800
Well, it starts with changing that

237
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,000
belief. It's not not true that you don't

238
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,160
have children. It's not hard. Right? We

239
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,919
all know that's true. The story you have

240
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,520
that says, "I have three children and so

241
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
it's really hard." The more you tell

242
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,400
yourself, the more you can't do

243
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,560
anything. It's like hypnosis. You're

244
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,199
hypnotized into it's so hard. I can't.

245
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,720
It is hard and you can. You can, but we

246
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,840
got to start small and get momentum.

247
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
That's the piece that we got to do for

248
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,560
you. And for you right now, what you

249
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
really need to do is get someone who's

250
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,199
going to come kick your butt a little

251
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
bit. You need somebody who's going to

252
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
not take this stuff. Cuz here's the

253
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,479
challenge. When you surround yourself

254
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720
with girlfriends, the beauty of feminine

255
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,080
women is they support each other. But

256
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,520
the challenge with that is you can

257
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,520
support each other and feeling good and

258
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,080
then not change. So, we need two things.

259
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,199
No more story and a new game plan. If

260
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,919
you're up for it, I'll get someone who

261
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,960
will actually coach you. Oh, I'm I'm up

262
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,639
for it. How about um also maybe uh you

263
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
saying something about the guy part?

264
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,599
Yes,

265
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
maybe that has. All right, we're going

266
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,120
to do you know Tonyy's going to create

267
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,400

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
take advantage of. Tony, thank you very
