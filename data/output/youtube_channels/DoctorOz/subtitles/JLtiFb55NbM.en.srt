00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,640
Apple cider vinegar. For years, we've

there's a new kid in town.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,880
A lot of people didn't even know this

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,120
existed. It's actually been very big in

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,680
Asia for many, many years.

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,600
Taste this.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,400
Oh. Oh, that's good.

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,279
Plus, Chuba Gooding Jr. on the role that

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,200

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,840
Y'all see it? Is that excitement or fear

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,520
on their faces?

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
We'll find out in a second. But first,

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,840
let's start with what this little shot

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,840
can do for you. Here, you get two shots.

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
Save that for me. Apple cider vinegar

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
not only can help you control your blood

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,799
sugar, but we've received countless

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,960
success stories from viewers about how

49
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,640
it kickstarted healthy transformations

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,240
from all over the country. So, Janette

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,399
says that after taking apple cider

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,840
vinegar, she felt less bloated. This is

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,759
a before and after on her. Then,

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,600
Michelle says she saw a major

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,160
improvement in her energy throughout the

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,319
day. And Tamara says she dropped more

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,560
than a dress size by adding vinegar to

58
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,720
her everyday routine. They've all shared

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,400
with us their information, how they used

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,920
the apple cider vinegar, when they drank

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,239
it, what they ate it with, all the

62
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,760
details. And I've got diet expert Jen

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,040
Weeders, who's going to help us look

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,040
through all the data and is here with

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,680
the ultimate vinegar prescription that

66
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,640
you can try, too.

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,360
Hi, baby.

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,879
How are you?

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,200
I can't come to New York and not do your

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,720
show.

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,680
Well, I'm very happy you're here. And

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,040
there's so much to talk about because

73
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,239
this apple cider vinegar has become,

74
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,160
first of all, it's so easy to do. People

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
want to do it. It's affordable, but most

76
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,440
importantly, it seems to work for a lot

77
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,200
of folks. So, why do you think it's so

78
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,959
powerful? To me, I always describe it as

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
like the Ringo star of the Beatles. Like

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,760
he's been here the whole time and he's

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
always been in the background. And

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,640
that's apple cider vinegar. I mean, my

83
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,319
grandparents, grandparents told them

84
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,360
about it. They told me about it. And I

85
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,800
think it's one of those best kept

86
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,120
secrets because it's effective, it's

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,239
powerful, it's natural, and as you said,

88
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,400
it's really affordable as well.

89
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,239
But there are lots of opinions, tons of

90
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,319
opinions about apple cider vinegar, and

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,599
everyone's been taking it. But I want to

92
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,280
get those opinions into one place. So,

93
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,440
first off, you've crowdsourced some

94
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,800
data. Yeah. So, from your research, how

95
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,680
much apple cider vinegar should the

96
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
average person be taking?

97
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,800
I think ultimately what you want to

98
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,480
start with is three teaspoons a day. And

99
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
I like that spaced out and you can kind

100
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
of see how you're reacting, what your

101
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
body's talking and saying to you, and

102
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,640
then go from there.

103
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,239
All right. So, give us a quick glance of

104
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
what it might look like. A typical day.

105
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,400
Yeah.

106
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,360
Looks like this. The the prescription

107
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,720
plan with vinegar.

108
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,840
Exactly. Because we got a doctor. We're

109
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,440
going to prescribe you guys. So, here we

110
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,959
go. We got a teaspoon just before

111
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,640
breakfast, a teaspoon of the apple cider

112
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,720
vinegar just before lunch, and we have

113
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,280
that mystery vinegar just before your

114
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,879
dinner.

115
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,360
All right. So, we we did the crowd

116
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,360
sourcing. Turns out breakfast is the

117
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,640
most popular time to take the apple

118
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
cider vinegar. It's to do it in the

119
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,280
morning. That's the first part of our

120
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,360
plan. We're going to say that the

121
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,440
teaspoon of apple cider vinegar ought to

122
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
be taken before your breakfast. Yeah.

123
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
You actually agree with what people are

124
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
doing that you think it makes sense.

125
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
Take it early.

126
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,239
I I love it because basically it it's

127
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,599
it's the perfect warm-up for your

128
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,560
workout and your body, right?

129
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
All right, let's see how our viewers do

130
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,439
with this. Come on over here. Made it

131
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,080
part of their daily routine. Joining us

132
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,840
is Jamie. This is her before picture.

133
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,239
And here she is after.

134
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,120
I like it. I like it.

135
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,599
Thank you.

136
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
So, I it's I mean, you look great, but

137
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
it's it's not so much the looks. You

138
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,120
actually say you have a lot more energy.

139
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,440
I have a lot more energy. I was having a

140
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,880
a when I was starting my new lifestyle,

141
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,120
I was having a hard time like getting

142
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,199
into like a schedule like eating

143
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
breakfast and I was like just lacking

144
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,720
the stamina, the energy. So, I started

145
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,800
taking uh a few I started with a two few

146
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. you

147
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,919
were going for a party

148
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,880
and then I was shooting it like like a

149
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,120
shot. So I was going hard or that that

150
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,560
was it. I needed to jump start it. So it

151
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,800
helped me with my stamina for my

152
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,520
swimming and really I mean I lost weight

153
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,759
but it really helped me to you know get

154
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,080
into this new healthy lifestyle like

155
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,479
naturally and I've really reaped the

156
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,320
benefits.

157
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,520
I admire you for doing it but I don't

158
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,759
know how you take that much apple cider

159
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,120
vinegar. This is my personal experience

160
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,240
with apple cider vinegar when you take

161
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,479
it as a straight shot. Take a look. Very

162
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,600
um sour. It's actually burning.

163
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,280
Sour. Tangy.

164
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,890
Are you ready to see if the kids would

165
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
taste this?

166
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,800
[Music]

167
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,919
Oh, it's tangy. All right.

168
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,759
[Applause]

169
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,840
And the lemon really gives it a nice

170
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,360
little zing.

171
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,520
I thought I had no thing to begin with.

172
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,520
Now he's

173
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,240
now you see the problem that I have. Did

174
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,360
you have a hack? A hack that allowed you

175
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,199
to take apple cider vinegar.

176
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,880
I sure do. Okay. So, you're going to

177
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,039
start with some warm water. And then

178
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,800
you're going to put in a teaspoon or a

179
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,199
tablespoon if you're, you know, zesty

180
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
like me.

181
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,080
Going hard like this one. Yeah.

182
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,680
And, uh, you're going to add some

183
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,960
cayenne pepper, some lemon juice.

184
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
Cayenne pepper.

185
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
It's,

186
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,520
it's hard enough as it is.

187
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
I'm a little spicy. And so should you

188
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,960
be. Okay. So,

189
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,199
she's giving you a prescription.

190
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,479
Yeah.

191
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,720
This is going to make you feel great.

192
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,400
It's gonna, you know, make you feel like

193
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,240
you're ready for the day. You're gonna

194
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,680
jump out of bed. You're gonna, you know,

195
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
whatever you need to do. It's going to

196
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,199
give you the stamina and energy that you

197
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,720
need. But part of what I like,

198
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,400
there's no way.

199
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
Now, we can add that to the real, okay,

200
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,600
on all of his reactions. But part of

201
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,280
what I like about the vinegar, too,

202
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,720
though, is it's actually uh because it

203
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,240
does kind of regulate your blood sugar.

204
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,759
It keeps you guys from crashing. And

205
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
that's where she says stamina. I light

206
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,919
up. I'm like, "Oh, good." Because

207
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
there's that feeling when you crash and

208
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,720
you don't have the energy for the

209
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
workout to keep going. It kind of levels

210
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,039
you off and and equips you with that

211
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,240
energy, right?

212
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,360
Absolutely. Absolutely.

213
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,880
How about still burning? Tell me what

214
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
I'd pair it with. I'd have to eat

215
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
something else.

216
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,400
Yeah. I'm gonna I'm gonna be your best

217
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
friend now. So, this is actually all the

218
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,919
recipes today are out of my book, but

219
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
this is what I call protein oats. Uh I

220
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,120
want you guys starting your mornings

221
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,560
with protein and fiber. And when I say

222
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,479
oatmeal, people are confused. They think

223
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,400
what? Protein, fiber, and oats. Yes.

224
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,080
Okay. So, what I want you to do, I want

225
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,600
a third cup of those raw oats, which I

226
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,759
know sounds funny. Half a scoop of

227
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,000
vanilla protein. You get your you get

228
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,280
your uh kids cereal. You put it on there

229
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
and a little bit of almond milk, the

230
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
unsweetened. And it gives you a little

231
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,240
bit of what I need in you, which is the

232
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,599
protein and and and the and the fiber.

233
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,319
And then you also get a little of what

234
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,080
you want, too.

235
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,880
So, you have the apple cider vinegar

236
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
first and then do that.

237
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,680
Yeah. I want this almost like 30 minutes

238
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,360
before your breakfast, you guys. And

239
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
then this can go in after. Yes.

240
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
Congratulations.

241
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,199
Thank you so much.

242
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
Let's Now, let's get to lunch.

243
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,000
We got lunch over here. And Jennifer is

244
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,759
waiting for us.

245
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,960
The vine the vinegar prescription for

246
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
lunch is a little different. Now, you've

247
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,639
noticed some changes in yourself as

248
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
well.

249
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
I've noticed some changes. I've noticed

250
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,880
that I have a little bit more energy. It

251
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,039
also I'm a person that's so busy on the

252
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,440
go all the time. And I feel like when I

253
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,720
do this in the morning that I don't get

254
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,880
at lunchtime, I would just grab for

255
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,120
anything the the snackiest snack I could

256
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,800
find, the chips, the all the salt. So I

257
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,400
feel like doing this in the morning, it

258
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,360
curbs that where it kind of gives me

259
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,160
time where I can it helps me get to the

260
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,479
point where I can pick something

261
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,520
healthy.

262
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,560
Right. So you have the apple cider

263
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,199
vinegar in the morning, but you also do

264
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,120
it at lunch.

265
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,240
I do. And I I I can't do it just like

266
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
this. So, I'll put it maybe on some

267
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,680
lettuce and take that with me to go.

268
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,720
Don't add cayenne, by the way.

269
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,080
This is

270
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,599
But you have another hack that you use

271
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
at lunchtime that actually works for

272
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,199
you.

273
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,479
I do. And I like to call it the pretty

274
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,960
and pink iced tea.

275
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,560
Oh, pretty. So, I get it now. One. Now,

276
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,720
I get it. Yes.

277
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,440
So, you just take about I'd say about 16

278
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,360
ounces warm water, one teaspoon apple

279
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,520
cider vinegar, a couple slices of apple,

280
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,960
some lemon, some grapefruit, and a

281
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,840
couple leaves in there, and you're good

282
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,759
to go. I also I also like

283
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,960
this is so much better. Are you kidding

284
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,599
me?

285
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
Taste this.

286
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,479
I can't believe he's pitting you against

287
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,360
each other.

288
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,919
Oh, that's good.

289
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,199
It's good.

290
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,599
That's good. It's not as You know,

291
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,840
you Jamie

292
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,240
assed my mouth. This this actually could

293
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
work.

294
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
It's good. And if you make it the night

295
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,959
before, enough for the week. Every all

296
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,479
the ingredients incorporate and it's

297
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,719
it's great. Then you have it ready to

298
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,839
go.

299
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,640
And what's the pair for this at lunch?

300
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,240
So, you're going to love this. And

301
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,760
Jennifer, I actually really much uh very

302
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,800
much synergize with with that kind of

303
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,160
lifestyle. You're running, you're going,

304
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,560
you're grabbing. Like I'll eat cardboard

305
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,600
if I'm hungry. I don't care. So, uh,

306
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
what I'm going to give you is not

307
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,200
cardboard, but what I suggest is a high

308
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,480
protein pita pocket, okay? Because it's

309
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,320
literally you can take it on the go

310
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
wherever you need to. Often we're eating

311
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,959
in our cars more and more. This is

312
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,120
something you can also pre-make like

313
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,880
Jennifer's drink. And literally, we got

314
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
we got salmon, we've got Greek yogurt,

315
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,519
we got some dill, salt, and pepper to

316
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,880
taste. Throw some greens in there. And

317
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,480
plus, you've got that benefit of the

318
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,839
probiotics in the Greek yogurt, which is

319
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
basically like friendly bacteria for

320
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,839
your

321
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,320
It pairs nicely with the apple cider

322
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,680
iced tea.

323
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,839
Oh, there are no mistakes. The pink

324
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,720
dress, the pink drink.

325
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,560
Okay, we're going to put all these

326
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
recipes on dr.com. When we come back,

327
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,440
the new vinegar, there's a new one that

328
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,279
we're adding to the mix that could be

329
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,959
the next power combo with apple cider

330
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,200
vinegar. Plus, get ready for the biggest

331
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,959
Oz show record. Apple cider vinegar

332
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,310
challenge is next.

333
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm ready.

334
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:37,080
[Applause]

335
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:40,399
[Music]

336
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,399
[Applause]

337
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,760
How to murder your husband. The chilling

338
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,000
romantic suspense story that made

339
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,120
headlines. Did the author turn her

340
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,380
fantasy fiction into reality?

341
00:09:51,120 --> 00:10:00,399
All new Oz. That's coming up tomorrow.

342
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,920
[Music]

343
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,560
We're back with the ultimate vinegar

344
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,160
prescription plan for you by you. My

345
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,080
team has crowdsourced all over the

346
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,519
country to find out what really works

347
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,440
when it comes to adding apple cider

348
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,519
vinegar to your routine. And they found

349
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,120
a new vinegar that could be a power

350
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,399
ingredient to your meals. Are you ready

351
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,680
for this everybody?

352
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,880
It is coconut vinegar.

353
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,720
Coconut vinegar.

354
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,320
The diet expert Jen Reerm is back. She

355
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,480
says the buzz building about coconut

356
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,760
vinegar is huge. So what is it and how

357
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,560
is it different different from apple

358
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,240
cider vinegar?

359
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,839
So I like a lot of people didn't even

360
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,440
know this existed. So, I had to research

361
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,279
into it and it's actually been very big

362
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,640
in Asia for many many years and it's

363
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,399
just kind of making a splash now in the

364
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,760
States. Um, but essentially it's the way

365
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,920
it's made that makes it so different.

366
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,839
They they take the leaves from a coconut

367
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,839
tree and there's a sap that forms from

368
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,240
them and we take that sap. We like I

369
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,519
made it. They take the sap and they

370
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,040
allow it to ferment for like eight

371
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,320
months and then that's how they they

372
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,600
formulate their their vinegar.

373
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,279
So, it's not from the actual meat. It's

374
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
not from the coconut water, not it's

375
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,920
it's the leaves on the trees and the sap

376
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,839
they make.

377
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,800
So, how do you find it? What does it

378
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,640
cost? What do you look for?

379
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes, it's definitely not at your local

380
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,440
uh convenience stores. So, I would

381
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,959
definitely look at your health stores.

382
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
They'll carry probably an array of

383
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,320
really good ones. Um, make sure you're

384
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,240
looking for it's that it's fermented and

385
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,399
it's made from the leaves. And do not

386
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,839
mistake this with coconut water that is

387
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,800
not the same and it's going to be a

388
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
totally different show.

389
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,680
Yeah. And they've also they they make

390
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,200
versions of this that are made from

391
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,880
coconut water where they add, you know,

392
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
sugar to it. Basically, this is the real

393
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,680
stuff.

394
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,360
Exactly.

395
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,640
All right. So, is this the way you make

396
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,240
it into a mocktail?

397
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,880
Right. Thank you for pointing out my

398
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,000
mocktail, guys. So, and that's right.

399
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,839
It's again, it's one, like you said

400
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
before, it's one teaspoon. Yes. But this

401
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,680
is before dinner, not breakfast or

402
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,519
lunch.

403
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,640
Yes. Exactly. Right before dinner. And I

404
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,160
don't know about you, when I'm cooking,

405
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,680
I kind of want a cocktail or a glass of

406
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,320
wine. And I felt like what a great way

407
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,000
to bring in the coconut vinegar. And

408
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,360
it's great before dinner is at the end

409
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
of the day, we're tired, we're beat up,

410
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,959
and imagine a long shift to the hospital

411
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,680
for you or even here. And our immunity

412
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,519
is low. And so, this coconut vinegar has

413
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,600
potassium, vitamin C, all these things

414
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,200
that help with those immune boosts. So,

415
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
I've kind of made this up. You're gonna

416
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,040
give me a yay or a nay?

417
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,399
This is really good.

418
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,079
Oh my god, I was so nervous. Okay.

419
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,680
No, this is really really good.

420
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,240
So, you just take the mint leaves. You

421
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,240
you you you basically grind it into the

422
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
coconut vinegar. You give me a splash of

423
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,000
lime juice here. Give me some seltzer.

424
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,920
Throw it on the rocks. Put a martini

425
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,839
glass like Mr. Fancy Pants here. But

426
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,279
either way, you're set. You're good.

427
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,360
You're taking care of your body and your

428
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,880
immunity. And it tastes pretty good.

429
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,240
I like it. And the pairing is with

430
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,560
Oh, yeah. There are no mistakes here.

431
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,160
So, I've paired it with uh slow cooker

432
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,440
uh chicken fajitas. At the end of the

433
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,519
day, we're talking about how there's no

434
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
time left. Let the food cook itself.

435
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,560
There's everything with protein,

436
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,720
vegetables, flavors. Awesome. It pairs

437
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
well with the cocktail/mocktail.

438
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,920
See what I did there?

439
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
Yes.

440
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,079
And guess what? Come over here. We've

441
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
got some for you.

442
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
I'm going to challenge the audience. I

443
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,440
want you guys to give me a choice. You

444
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,639
want to have it straight up or you want

445
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
one of the mocktails that Jen's

446
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,240
offering?

447
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,240
Mocktail. All right.

448
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,480
All right. Go ahead and taste these

449
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,880
things. Oh, everyone. No one's taking it

450
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,320
straight up. You won straight up.

451
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,360
They're all mocktails. I guess

452
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,800
I like

453
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,720
Well, you're left with their You guys

454
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,800
like them? Taste it. See if you like I'm

455
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,240
not the only person. I hope. Pass here.

456
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,000
See if you like those. Take a little

457
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,320
bit. Shake it down. That was me. I'm

458
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
guessing

459
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,279
one last one for you.

460
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,240
What do you guys think?

461
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,120
Could it work?

462
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,959
Yes,

463
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,320
it could work, right? I think it's

464
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,480
different. I got to say, you know, apple

465
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,880
cider vinegar is so popular that the

466
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,320
having a little diversity and something

467
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,680
a tiny bit sweeter because it's a little

468
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
sweeter would make a lot of sense.

469
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,639
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right, Jen, you're

470
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
brilliant at all this. I want you all to

471
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
check out Jen's book, by the way, Diet

472
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,480
Right for Your Personality type. If you

473
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,760
got a great personality like hers,

474
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
you'll definitely like it. And we're

475
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,480
going to put the vinegar prescription

476
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,880
plan on dr.com.

477
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,639
But now, the moment we have all been

478
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,079
waiting for. You all have your apple

479
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,440
cider vinegar.

480
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,720
Raise them high, guys.

481
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,839
Everyone here, we all take a shot

482
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,440
together. This is how you break the

483
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,040
world record, right? You take a shot

484
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,200
together. The record on the biggest

485
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,639
apple cider vinegar group shot. I have

486
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,360
never had this many people take a shot

487
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,800
with me on a show before. Period. You

488
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,560
know, I don't love apple cider vinegar

489
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,000
by itself, but I'm doing it for you.

490
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,360
Some of you don't like it either. It's

491
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
okay. Just as one time. You all want in

492
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,240
on this?

493
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,920
Everyone's taking their shot all around

494
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,959
the studio, in my offices, even

495
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:09,959
backstage. Y'all ready? Three, two, one,

496
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,959
go.

497
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Okay.

498
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,079
I like it.

499
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,240
All right. Now, everybody at home,

500
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,639
you're a little quiet.

501
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
Are you okay? Cheers to help though.

502
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,440
Not bad.

503
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,639
We got not bad. We got people like me. I

504
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,639

505
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,519

hashtag ACV challenge. I'll share the

507
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,240
best ones. We'll be right back. Was that

508
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,920
fun? You like it?

509
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,519

his health offcreen. Can you drop us a

513
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,079
little hint? Little tiny hint.

514
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,320
Show me the honey.

515
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,320
Stay tuned.

516
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,079
Yeah. Well, you know, uh, me and your

trainer here, we was in the Olympics

518
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,360
together.

519
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,680
You remember Diane from track and field,

520
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,279
right?

521
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,880
Ah, you was going to bring that. You

522
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,320
remember when I used to stop you in the

523
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,160
second round of sparring, right? You

524
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,760
peed yourself that left hook.

525
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,839
Now, you pushing it too far. Yeah, you

526
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,600
pushing it too far now. Just you pushing

527
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,800
it just a little too far. So, now you

528
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,920
Dr. Seuss. You going to write a You

529
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,360
going to write a make believe.

530
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,680
I just wish your hands moved as fast as

531
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
your mouth.

532
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,000
Okay. Well, I tell you what, whatever

533
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,000

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:59,040
[Music]

547
00:15:51,690 --> 00:16:01,199
[Applause]

548
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,120
How are you, man?

549
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,399
That was very dangerous what you did.

550
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,320
That audience would have grabbed you and

551
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,680
taken you in, never let you go.

552
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,199
They adore you.

553
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,440
How you doing? You look good,

554
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,279
man. You, too. It's strong. He's strong.

555
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,720
I'm just trying to keep up with to keep

556
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,480
a good ease of the world. So, we just

557
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,000
saw a little clip of Bayou Caviar. Yeah.

558
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,600
And just because he he not only he's

559
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,720
acting it, but he directed it. Yeah.

560
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,920
Right. And you are incredibly in good

561
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
shape to be able to even keep up with

562
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,639
that. How do you do that? It's a show

563
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,079
about a retired boxer.

564
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,279
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've been boxing for

565
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,600
about 25 years now. And um we were in

566
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,639
New Orleans when we shot it and I had

567
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,399
real professional pros come play with us

568
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,720
and uh there's one scene in the movie

569
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,720
where I took one to the face and I I

570
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,440
kept it in a movie.

571
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,440
It hurts.

572
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,199
Yeah, it does. It really does. Yeah.

573
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
The last time I boxed I was in college.

574
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,880
Yeah.

575
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,240
And the first thing I and most important

576
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
thing I learned was the duck.

577
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,920
That's right.

578
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,600
Which is a good lesson in life.

579
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,480
And to keep your keep your hands up.

580
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,880
Keep your hands up if you're not going

581
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,320
to duck.

582
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,320
That's right. So he you all remember won

583
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,320
the Oscar for best supporting actor for

584
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,160
football player Rod Tidwell. That was 20

585
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
years ago. And so I want to go back a

586
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,039
little bit.

587
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,880
I I think all of us were influenced

588
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,640
profoundly by the role and and

589
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,240
welldeserved Oscar victory and your of

590
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,839
course your speech when you got up

591
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
there. Unforgettable.

592
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,400
Thank you.

593
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,240
If what would you tell yourself back

594
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
then if you could right now? What wisdom

595
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,360
have you gained that we could all learn

596
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,160
from?

597
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,559
Um

598
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,760
I think I think the most thing is to

599
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:36,240
stay focused on your artistry as an

600
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,240
actor, the passion of your work and and

601
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,120
continue to grow even though you because

602
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,200
you remember

603
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,440
I became Academy Award winner Kubernet

604
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,000
Jr. So I was too precious about that

605
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,240
title when I should have just worked

606
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,880
just kept working with great directors.

607
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Yeah.

608
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,520
Can we talk about your dad?

609
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,840
Sure. iconic musician, legendary soul

610
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,520
singer. I mean, an inspiration to a lot

611
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,679
of folks, but especially to you. And you

612
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,840
lost him. What was that like?

613
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,600
You know, it's hard. I think any the

614
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,559
loss of any parent, you feel a part of

615
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,880
you dies with the parent. And um my

616
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,840
father uh and mother had split up when I

617
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,600
was young. And I uh never understood

618
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,240
what was more important to him um family

619
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,600
or his career until I actually stepped

620
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,039
on stage in London um and got the

621
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,200
opportunity to sing in front of an

622
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,000
audience and and I I think that's why I

623
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,840
accepted that the the Broadway um offer

624
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,799
to come and do Chicago here as Billy

625
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,080
Flynn. Um yeah, it made me understand my

626
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,240
father a little bit more.

627
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,320
So which is more important? I think if

628
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,080
you can marry those two together, your

629
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,720
life will truly be enriched.

630
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,480
So, you're making this this wonderful

631
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,039
piece about OJ Simpson

632
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,440
that you really brought alive.

633
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,720
Thank you.

634
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,480
And in the middle of that, you lose your

635
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,080
dad. I mean, how how do you how do you

636
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,919
deal with the emotional trials and

637
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,600
tribulations of being in that character

638
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,919
at the same time there are things

639
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,919
happening outside and off the film that

640
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,000
are pulling at you? Well, that's a that

641
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,720
was it's a very that was an very

642
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,280
interesting time in my life because I

643
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,440
think all of my roles that make a real

644
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,960
impact in my career have been the ones

645
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,960
that have been closest to what's going

646
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,559
on in my personal life. If you look at

647
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,400
Boys in the Hood, I played the, you

648
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,160
know, Trey who finally gets that

649
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,480
scholarship and gets out of, you know,

650
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,039
the inner city violence. And at the

651
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,200
time, that was my first lead in a film

652
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,559
and then I became on the radar of

653
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,120
America. Then my next um part playing

654
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,679
Rod Tidwell in Jerry Magcguire, it was a

655
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,520
guy who who was a a famous football

656
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,600
player who kind of loses his way and

657
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,240
then he gets the big contract. And here

658
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,400
I am six years after Boys and Hood

659
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,080
finally getting a role that not only

660
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,200
brings me back into the spotlight, but I

661
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,400
win the Oscar for

662
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,559
uh OJ. I had just split with my my wife.

663
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,080
I had a young daughter uh the same age

664
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,080
as Sid Cindy and I lived in the area

665
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,559
where the murders took place in the same

666
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,640
city. Um I was always running into

667
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:06,960
people who knew OJ who had stories about

668
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,200
him and the reality and and fantasy line

669
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,760
started to blur for me and I used to

670
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,520
laugh at actors who say you know this

671
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,440
was a character that took me a while to

672
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,600
shake as dark character. I understand

673
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,200
what that means now because I think each

674
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,320
character kind of makes an imprint on

675
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,559
your soul. Mhm.

676
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,440
And to go that dark in that dark a place

677
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,760
to open my psyche up in that dark a

678
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,320
place affected me for several months

679
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,440
after finishing that role, you know,

680
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,200
it's pretty dark.

681
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,880
But having put yourself in that role,

682
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,720
Yeah. what do you think now about the

683
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,880
criminal justice system

684
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,520
and African-American men? I mean, how

685
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,799
does Yeah.

686
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,799
How does your perception about being

687
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,480
charged with a crime

688
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,159
change having played that?

689
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,240
Oh, you know, I don't know if it

690
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,919
changed. I just I know that there was

691
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,760
something broken especially in that time

692
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,000
period 1992.

693
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,640
You know, I was uh pulled over by police

694
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,080
when I was a break dancer with my crew

695
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,679
because I looked a certain way in a

696
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,120
neighborhood that they felt I wasn't

697
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,960
supposed to be in.

698
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:09,520
But yet I was an actor who was making

699
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:13,280
money and yet I got um pro uh racially

700
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,120
profiled. So um and I get it. I get it.

701
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,039
you know, uh there's there's men and

702
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,039
women of our law enforcement that that

703
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,559
you know, they have a lot of stress, but

704
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,559
to see and the walk in those shoes of a

705
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,400
character that is exposed to that life

706
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,440
without no uh way to get out, it's it's

707
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,720
very eye opening.

708
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,919
Now, I don't think you've ever spoken to

709
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,159
OJ. Is that is that correct?

710
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,320
No, no, no, no.

711
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,240
If if you could what would you ask him?

712
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,080
What would your question be just to get

713
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,640
a conversation going?

714
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,080
You mean if if I asked him what about

715
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,080
anything about life about just to

716
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,760
understand you know him probably better

717
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,080
than almost anybody else time period

718
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,480
more than I thought I ever would being

719
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,559
now stepped in his shoes but

720
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,600
specifically with OJ I believe when he

721
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,280
passes away if they do a autopsy on his

722
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,360
brain they'll find the CTE concussion

723
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,840
syndrome I truly believe that because um

724
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,000
you know that coupled with the fact that

725
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,120
men like that who show this ability to

726
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,559
have uh you know this athletic gift that

727
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,080
God gives them and everybody around you,

728
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,520
they literally stop your social um um

729
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,960
development

730
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,880
young because they want you to just

731
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,720
focus on this athletic ability that you

732
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,159
have. They make money off of you and

733
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,919
then they spit you out of the system and

734
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,240
yet you still have a mentality as a

735
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,760
child.

736
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,880
It's so interesting you say that because

737
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,840
we had OJ's lawyer on the show

738
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,520
and he brought a question to me from OJ.

739
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,760
They haven't talked about this much, but

740
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,480
OJ wanted to know about chronic

741
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,760
traumatic enapylopathy, CTE, this head

742
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,320
injury that football players are

743
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,799
getting.

744
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,880
Wow.

745
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,320
So, I was sort of caught up off guard by

746
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,919
him wanting to know more about head

747
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,520
trauma, having played football. You

748
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,840
know, he rushed for so many yards, every

749
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,200
time he rushed, he got hit and tackled.

750
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,240
But you think that might be something

751
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,840
that

752
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
you may have found just playing the

753
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,240
role?

754
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,919
Oh, 100%. You're not taking all that

755
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,760
abuse to your head and not having

756
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,960
bruises on your brain. It is trying to

757
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,240
cause lots of other problems as well.

758
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,600
But let me turn from that to you

759
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,799
personally. Okay. I just noticed your

760
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,039
voice a little horse.

761
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,400
Yeah.

762
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,400
And I know that you actually

763
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Yeah. Come on, Dr. H. What you going to

764
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,960
do? Don't break it down on me now.

765
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,640
So, in order to play the role of OJ Yes.

766
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
You had to adjust your voice.

767
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,880
Yeah.

768
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,200
And did this start after that?

769
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,640
Uh, a little bit before it. A little bit

770
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,440
before it, but yeah, it was in

771
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,039
intensified with that.

772
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,760
I'm just smiling at you. I'm curious

773
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,760
what happened.

774
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,159
Well, you know, it's so funny. I had

775
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,000
went and saw an ENT and they put that

776
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,720
rod down my throat and looked at my book

777
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,559
because they want to make sure there

778
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,919
wasn't any palyps or any

779
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,080
anything cancerous or anything. They're

780
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,320
like, "No, no, it's just uh swollen and

781
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,000
sore and uh you need to relax a little

782
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,679
bit. You need to really relax."

783
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,120
And what I found is I I have this issue

784
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,200
where I I'm a night owl and I would

785
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,240
sleep before I I mean, sorry, eat before

786
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
I'd go to bed.

787
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,320
Yes. And what I would do is I would eat

788
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,559
and then I'd sleep and all of the food

789
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,480
would go up and then the the stomach

790
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,360
acids would kind of mess with my vocal

791
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,919
cords.

792
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,320
How do you like that?

793
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,679
So I finally realized that I had to stop

794
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,480
doing that and uh and it and it's uh

795
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,840
it's right at it.

796
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,840
Well, since you have become a world

797
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,600
expert on this, Dr. Gooding

798
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,080
and since you played Ben Carson called

799
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,679
me Dr. Good and I didn't go to school,

800
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,080
y'all.

801
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,279
So there's a really common reason you

802
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,360
can be a horse. When we come back, it

803
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,640
affects millions of people. Dr. Goody

804
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,690
Cub is going to help us hit reveal this

805
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,400
hidden cause. Stay with us.

806
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:39,039
[Applause]

807
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,440
Warning signs that can go unnoticed.

808
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,360
I was undiagnosed for 22 years.

809
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,400
How do you know if you're at risk for

810
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,000
thyroid cancer?

811
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,960
It sneaks up on you, which is one of the

812
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,960
reasons we miss it.

813
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,340
All new Oz.

814
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,470
That's coming up on Wednesday.

815
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,470
[Applause]

816
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,360
We are backstage with Cha Gooding Jr.

817
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,440
We're about to reveal the number one

818
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,120
hidden reason for a horse voice,

819
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,240
constant coughing, throat clearing, and

820
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,919
lots of other stuff. And we're not

821
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,360
talking about a cold. So, I know you're

822
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,400
worried about vocal cord issues. You got

823
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,000
through your performer. But, you know,

824
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,400
he's starting on Broadway in Chicago

825
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,480
playing Billy Flynn. Oh, you're the

826
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,559
perfect guy to do that, too.

827
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,919
But since we're backstage before go out

828
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,520
and reveal our audience, what kind of

829
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,279
exercises do you do before you start the

830
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,039
theater every day? Well, with the v

831
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,520
vocal cords, you want to keep them warm

832
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,840
and loose, just like any muscle. So, a

833
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,840
lot of humming.

834
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,600
And then you also want to make sure that

835
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,000
your neck and your face is relaxed. So,

836
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,799
we do this thing called the lion pose.

837
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,559
Lion pose.

838
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,400
Yes. You want to get your tongue out as

839
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,000
far as you can, your eyes as wide as you

840
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,919
can, your fingers as spread as part as

841
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,760
you can, but breathe normally.

842
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,240
And then slowly afterwards go into a

843
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,520
yawn. Ah.

844
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,720
Ah,

845
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,640
that's a lion's pose.

846
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,960
I like it. Maybe I'll go to Broadway.

847
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
Yeah,

848
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,000
come on over here. A different kind of

849
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,279
vocal cord check that I want everyone to

850
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,960
think about today cuz so many of you

851
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,640
complain to me about this problem. There

852
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,840
probably 20 million people who have the

853
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
underlying issue and I'll come back to

854
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,720
that in a second.

855
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,840
It has to do with silent acid reflux.

856
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,640
Mon'nique, how are you?

857
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,760
Good. How are you?

858
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
Is it Monique or Monica?

859
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,240
Monnique.

860
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,799
Monnique. All right. You may know this

861
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,440
gentleman

862
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,559
a little bit.

863
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,120
How are you, Milo?

864
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,880
How are you?

865
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,159
A little bit. How are you?

866
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,679
Are you able to continue

867
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,520
seen your face before?

868
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,440
Is that all right?

869
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,640
Have you seen my face before?

870
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,559
I did backstage.

871
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,679
I know. Actually, I didn't realize you

872
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,159
were the one in there and I was like,

873
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,520
"Oh, God."

874
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,440
You want me to You want me to leave?

875
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,480
Oh, no, no, no. You can stay. You can

876
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,919
stay. It's okay.

877
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,120
So, you know about silent reflex? We

878
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,080
just talked about it. Have you ever

879
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,559
heard about it, Monique?

880
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,520
No.

881
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,320
Never thought about it.

882
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,760
No, not really.

883
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,120
How many of you think you might have

884
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,640
silent reflux? Hands up. Oh, you're a

885
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,840
smart audience. I always say that. So,

886
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,120
this is the vocal cord check I want you

887
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,720
all to do together. Come on over, money.

888
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,480
Sure. And Dr. Dr. Goody, you come on

889
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,880
over with me. Gonna help us out. Okay.

890
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,919
If you have horseness,

891
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,600
you ever have horarsseness?

892
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,120
Absolutely. And it's a little

893
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,559
embarrassing because I already have a

894
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,440
funny sounding voice. I think

895
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,080
I like Oh, you sound great. Stop it.

896
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,080
Oh, you're the flatterer. But my voice

897
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,760
will get horsearo sometimes or break. I

898
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,880
sound like a teenage boy who's like

899
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,559
going through puberty. It's

900
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,919
embarrassing. Well, that's one kind of

901
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,360
horses. He's got another kind of horses,

902
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,799
but lots of kinds of horses we can get

903
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,400
into. Second thing, I'll put them up

904
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,559
here. Nagging cough. You ever get that?

905
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,520
Yes. Absolutely. And it's not a cold.

906
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,039
It's not allergy.

907
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,600
Yeah. Pretty common. Sore throat.

908
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,039
Yes.

909
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,400
So, all this fits into this little

910
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,159
constellation of issues called silent

911
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,360
reflux. And I'll never forget going to a

912
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,039
free clinic because we do them all over

913
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,279
the country and finding this young woman

914
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,080
who had been a very bad aszthmatic her

915
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,400
whole life.

916
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
Wow.

917
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,000
And then found out she didn't have

918
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,840
asthma, she had reflux. And that's where

919
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,600
a lot of folks end up finding out

920
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,360
they've got problems because the math's

921
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,720
pretty simple. You end up with a problem

922
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,640
with the with your stomach be able to

923
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,960
get the acid in the right direction. So

924
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,480
come on over. A lot of these symptoms

925
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,399
and then they make sense is basically

926
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
because acid's been burning you. Money,

927
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,159
you can come over me.

928
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,279
So if you look at this list, these are

929
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,960
the things I want you to start doing.

930
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,720
First, I want you to eliminate certain

931
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,480
foods from your diet. So look over that

932
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,000
big monitor over there, right? Which of

933
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,240
those foods do you see over there you

934
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,919
think you might want to eat less of? I

935
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,600
got a little chocolate there. Coffee,

936
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,440
tomatoes. What do you think?

937
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,200
Don't take my chocolate away. I love

938
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,399
chocolate. I do.

939
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,279
Cube, how about you? What are you eating

940
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,240
up there?

941
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,880
Well, coffee and the citrus. Uh, French

942
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,679
fries.

943
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
The French fries.

944
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,279
French fries.

945
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,880
You eat French fries.

946
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,640
French fries.

947
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,640
That's right. I eat the French fries.

948
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,039
All right. So, stay safe. D,

949
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,880
you don't back your way into this. up on

950
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,320
the French fries. So, you're eating the

951
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,559
French fries. French fries.

952
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,679
Well, at least I like the French fries.

953
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,600
At least at least while you're singing

954
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,559
it on Broadway, put the fries away. All

955
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,679
right, that's number one. Number two,

956
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,200
you brought it up. You eat late at

957
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,240
night. Yeah. You go right to bed. Y

958
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,360
What time you had dinner on me,

959
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,440
Monique? Usually around 9:00. I try to

960
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,200
eat before 9, but sometimes it's 9 or

961
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,120
later, but then I'm going to bed right

962
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,440
afterwards. So,

963
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,559
yeah,

964
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,600
you know that already.

965
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,240
Let me show you something. This is

966
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,840
really interesting. This little

967
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,360
animation, not too complicated. If you

968
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,039
eat less than 3 hours before bedtime,

969
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,320
you cause this problem. Food comes down

970
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,520
from your esophagus, that swallowing

971
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,880
tube drops in there. Let's say it's a

972
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,240
burger and fries, right? If you give

973
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,159
yourself a couple hours, even if you're

974
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,520
having fries, you dissolve the food, it

975
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,120
goes out with your stomach. But

976
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,120
especially if it's fatty food or that

977
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,159
acidic food and it stays in there, you

978
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,919
can't get it out there in less than

979
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,480
three hours. So when you fall asleep at

980
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,159
night, you lie down ideally, right?

981
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,279
Gravity takes the acid back up the

982
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,720
swallowing tube and you're not even

983
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,559
awake enough to protect your airway.

984
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,080
Yeah. So your bu vocal cords, those

985
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,320
beautiful precious vocal cords in your

986
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,880
case especially, but they get to bathe

987
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,600
in acid. You can do as many lion poses

988
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,559
as you want. Now part of the reason I

989
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,880
wanted Monique here.

990
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,559
Yes.

991
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,960
Is you have a little secret solution?

992
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,720
I do.

993
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,559
Are you willing to share it with Cuba?

994
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,559
Um I guess so.

995
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,080
Oh, please come.

996
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,440
That's a solution that you take.

997
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,960
Yeah, this is a solution.

998
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,320
This is a little home remedy that helps

999
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,000
with the with the horseness.

1000
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,159
Yes, I've heard a lot about ginger.

1001
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,720
So describe it to everybody. So, I

1002
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,559
usually do ginger tea. I do it plain. I

1003
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,039
don't add any sugar or honey or

1004
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,919
anything. Of course, you can, but I just

1005
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,840
do hot ginger tea. Some cold really

1006
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,080
doesn't work. It usually works on my

1007
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,960
voice if it's hot. Not too hot, you

1008
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,000
know, like a good

1009
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,279
saying it's like a muscle. You got to

1010
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,679
sort of loosen everything up in there.

1011
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,520
Yeah, absolutely. Sus. And

1012
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,240
some people find the ginger a little bit

1013
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,720
uh

1014
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,600
Oh, it's strong pungent. I got a little

1015
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,480
better idea. Goodbye.

1016
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,080
All right.

1017
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,399
Show me the honey.

1018
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,559
Yeah. Yay.

1019
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,960
Dare I say it? I'm showing you the

1020
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,200
honey.

1021
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,039
You got me. It makes it sweeter.

1022
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,200
I need my cat tree.

1023
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,240
I actually This is my own honey. I

1024
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,799
actually have bees.

1025
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,279
Oh, wow.

1026
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,440
And so I I have be I have my bee outfit

1027
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,080
by the way with my son getting the bees

1028
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,760

So this this is a little gift from the

1030
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,000
show.

1031
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,880
Show me the honey.

1032
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,600
Look at that.

1033
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,720
Nice.

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,600
come here without you. Not you in the

1076
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,840
way.

1077
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,919
I have no idea. My mom and my

1078
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,440
mother-in-law especially are kind of

1079
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,919
freaking out that I'm here right now.

1080
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,840

So they can come without you.

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,320
honor to have Tiffany here today. I hope

1091
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,760
you keep watching today's show, but

1092
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,919
forget about her. You come in person

1093
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,240
someday. I'm right in the front here.

1094
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,480
A love it. You're so sweet. You're so

1095
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,480
sweet.

1096
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,960
I'm so happy. So, you're a fantastic

1097
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,480
cook and I didn't even know that much

1098
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,320
about that side of your life. I I know

1099
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,159
you do have shows and all, but when I

1100
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,000
picked up Pull Up a Chair,

1101
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,679
which is beautifully illustrated, but

1102
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,039
also wonderful recipes, and I was

1103
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,279
actually convinced, you know, Daphne, my

1104
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,799
wife,

1105
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,919
yes, I do know. I know all about her.

1106
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,080
They're both chefs. They're highly

1107
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,279
critical of recipes. This they liked.

1108
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,840
First of all, why'd you call it pull up

1109
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,919
a chair?

1110
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,919
You know, it's funny. I I uh I grew up

1111
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,320
in a family where family dinners were

1112
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,320
every night and this way we connected.

1113
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,840
Um we would kind of decompress. We talk

1114
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,399
about our day, good and bad. And um I

1115
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,080
feel like nowadays with phones and TVs

1116
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,480
and a lot of distractions that we're

1117
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,360
missing that connection. Um, so pulling

1118
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,200
up a chair to me means reconnecting in

1119
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,440
the day, having a meal with the people

1120
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,320
that you love, um, and really kind of

1121
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,519
sharing moments.

1122
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,559
What does your mom say about your

1123
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,159
cooking? Is she happy?

1124
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,960
I'm very happy. I think she's happy

1125
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,519
because she doesn't have to do it

1126
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,200
anymore.

1127
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,960
Come on over here. Let's show off to all

1128
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,159
of America. First of all, you got

1129
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,919
something very special that you make.

1130
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,440
I do. I do. Um,

1131
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm interested. Yeah. Give Give the

1132
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,840
title of it, by the way.

1133
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,519
Okay. It's called Not Your Mama's

1134
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,280
Meatloaf.

1135
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,560
So, what does mama's is Robin? You said

1136
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,040
what does what does Robin's meatloaf

1137
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,000
look like?

1138
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,800
Yeah.

1139
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,879
Well, I think I think most people can

1140
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,639
kind of probably relate to traditional

1141
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,200
meatloaf being a little on the heavier

1142
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,839
side using pork and ground beef. And I

1143
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,520
actually use turkey and instead of using

1144
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,200
breadcrumbs, which is also on the

1145
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,919
heavier side, not so healthy. I use

1146
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
oats.

1147
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,839
Oh.

1148
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,720
And that's what actually binds it just

1149
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,560
as much as breadcrumbs.

1150
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,919
So, real quick, we got a turkey.

1151
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,480
Correct. You said you mentioned the

1152
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:35,679
oatmeal.

1153
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,839
We got the oats. We got onions, which

1154
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,399
we're sautéing right now. Um, look at

1155
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,000
you, sir.

1156
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,720
I'm going to be your sushi.

1157
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,079
I love it.

1158
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,000
I know it looks very clinical here.

1159
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,520
Oh my gosh, I love it. And purple. I

1160
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,320
like you. I like it.

1161
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,399
Color coordinated.

1162
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Um, we have a little worsture. We have

1163
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,079
tomato paste, eggs, of course, which is

1164
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,800
another binding. Great way to add some

1165
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,280
more protein. And

1166
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,639
what's this?

1167
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,919
Um, and that is Sriracha. Now, of

1168
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,760
course, if you're feeding this to the

1169
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:00,160
kids, you know, don't need to put that

1170
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,359
in, but I like it a little hot. So,

1171
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,640
I like that about you.

1172
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,640
Thank you.

1173
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,400
So, we've got the onion sautéing. You

1174
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,680
want to make sure you cool these first,

1175
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,720
of course, before you throw it back in

1176
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,480
because you're going to be literally

1177
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,480
mixing this all up. Okay? And you're

1178
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,240
going to stick that in. And then you're

1179
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,839
basically going to put your eggs. All

1180
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,079
right? So, I've got the oats. I'm going

1181
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,599
to throw that in. We've got our tomato

1182
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,800
paste. All right. And you just literally

1183
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,200
mix. And this is actually really

1184
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,400
something fun you can do with the kids.

1185
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
All right. So, this whole thing gets put

1186
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
into the

1187
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,520
Yes. So, let me just a little salt and

1188
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,880
pepper. You got to make sure you season

1189
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,640
your food.

1190
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,240
All right. You're going to actually put

1191
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,560
this in the pan. Stick in it. Look at

1192
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,320
you. Is it reminding you of something?

1193
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,880
Yes. This is sort of like bowel surgery.

1194
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,640
Okay, great.

1195
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,320
Okay.

1196
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,040
Okay. All right. Now, it's good enough.

1197
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,960
TMI, Dr. TMI.

1198
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Okay. And then oldfashioned thing. My

1199
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,720
mom used to do this and I kept it. I

1200
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,960
literally flatten it out, right? And

1201
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,280
then I actually put a coat of ketchup on

1202
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,640
top of it again. And it kind of leaves a

1203
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,720
really nice little glaze, which you can

1204
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,800
see there on the finished product. I

1205
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,160
love it. It's so good. I like a little

1206
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,160
kind of crust on the top. Right.

1207
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,520
What temperature? How long? Um 350 for

1208
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,320
about 45 to 50 minutes

1209
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,280
and you get this

1210
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,720
and you get that.

1211
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,480
Okay, now the moment of truth.

1212
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
Okay, come on. I'm telling you, you're

1213
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,839
not going to miss.

1214
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,599
First of all, let's describe the

1215
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,680
texture. It's full. It's rich.

1216
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,160
Well, and it's it's good, right? What do

1217
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,520
you think?

1218
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,320
The mouth feels fantastic,

1219
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,680
right? It's good.

1220
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,800
It fills you. And the oatmeal is

1221
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,079
actually better than bread crust.

1222
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,599
Yeah, I know. And then if you want

1223
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,040
something even better, like throw it

1224
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,240
between two pieces of bread and call it

1225
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,240
a sandwich. So,

1226
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,200
I like that.

1227
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,280
Up next, Tiffany has a healthier take on

1228
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,800
brownies as you. And this is you will

1229
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,560
not believe what fruit there's a clue

1230
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,160
what fruit she uses in place of some of

1231
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,200
that butter you guys throw in there.

1232
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,960
You're going to like it even better.

1233
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,680
That's next.

1234
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,680
It's actually very good.

1235
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,400

1241
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,480
We're back with Tiffany D having a

1242
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,240
blast. She's revealing healthy hacks to

1243
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,920
some of your favorite comfort foods.

1244
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,680
Listen, everybody loves a good brownie.

1245
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,800
The problem is you guys sabotage with

1246
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,119
how you make your brownies. So,

1247
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,240
Tiffany's got a hack to get yours a

1248
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,079
little bit healthier than it used to be.

1249
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,839
A little bit. A little bit. Look, I have

1250
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,760
two young kids and anytime I can kind of

1251
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,880
like throw a little something healthier

1252
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,640
in there, but still get them to eat

1253
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,040
something that I know they like. Um, and

1254
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,200
I do it with my desserts as well. So,

1255
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,079
um, one thing that I have is avocado

1256
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,280
brownies.

1257
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,680
Avocado is the fruit.

1258
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,680
So, avocado is the fruit. Um, it

1259
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,920
basically is a healthier fat and can be

1260
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,079
used just like butter. So, I take away

1261
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,079
some of the butter and I use the avocado

1262
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,960
and the kids have no idea that it's

1263
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,480
there. No,

1264
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,200
you will not know it's there. I promise

1265
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,079
you.

1266
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,280
I'm going to taste, but more

1267
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,560
importantly, we have a very discerning

1268
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,240
audience who's anxious. They're about to

1269
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,800
rush the table. But, so go over the

1270
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,920
basic ingredient.

1271
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,040
Yeah. So, you've got your basics. You

1272
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,800
got your chocolate. You've got your

1273
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,240
butter. You just don't need all that.

1274
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,079
You've got your flour, your sugar, your

1275
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,400
brown, your cocoa, and I I actually love

1276
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,160
espresso as well. Um Oh, espresso.

1277
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,040
Yeah. But it's super super easy. I'm

1278
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,240
telling you, like using avocado, make

1279
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,400
sure you put it in a blender. Really

1280
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,280
puree. So So it like it's really super

1281
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,079
super creamy.

1282
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,040
We actually did this here.

1283
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,839
See, look how creamy that is.

1284
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
So just put it in.

1285
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,599
This is not chunky guacamole, people.

1286
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,520
This is like, you know, creamy creamy

1287
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,280
creamy. There you can see it.

1288
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,960
Perfect. Exact. So again, take this,

1289
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,560
puree it. You add it in with all the

1290
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,920
ingredients. Bake for how long? Roughly.

1291
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,160
Uh I'm trying to remember. It goes in

1292
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,480
the oven 350 for about like 25 minutes I

1293
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,760
say.

1294
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,119
Okay. And your family loves these.

1295
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
Oh my gosh. And what is this? This

1296
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,839
paper. What is this?

1297
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,599
Parchment paper. Now look, my husband is

1298
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,079
great. He does not cook. Right.

1299
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,320
He's only the He does the dishes, but

1300
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,000
anytime if there's a pan in there that's

1301
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,079
stuck with stuff. He's like, "Parchment

1302
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
people, parchment paper people, please,

1303
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,359
please just make sure you use it." This

1304
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,400
is so great. Look at this. It lifts

1305
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,320
right up.

1306
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,000
And really, look, that's not bad.

1307
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,359
Why doesn't your husband understand this

1308
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,640
basic stuff? So great.

1309
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,320
Does your mother-in-law supports you or

1310
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,839
your husband in these kinds of battles?

1311
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,400
Both. She's very neutral. Sensitive

1312
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,160
point.

1313
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,720
She's really good. She's really good.

1314
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,599
You want to try it?

1315
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,079
Yeah. I'm just going to cut one, but I

1316
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,200
want to take the other.

1317
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,079
I'll cut it for you, honey. I'll feed

1318
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,320

Who's interested in brownies here? Okay.

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,000

Yeah.

1347
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,000
Like a scale of 1 to 10.

1348
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,119
All right.

How to murder your husband. The chilling

1371
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,200
romantic suspense story that made

1372
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,320
headlines. Did the author turn her

1373
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:36,680
fantasy fiction into reality?

1374
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:39,870
All new Oz. That's coming up tomorrow.

1375
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,870
[Applause]

1376
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,359
It is time for a 10second selfch check.

1377
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,720
What can your forehead tell you about

1378
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,640
your heart health? There's a new study

1379
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,839
who says you might want to grab a mirror

1380
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,040
or get your phone to look at your

1381
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,280
forehead right now. Take a quick photo

1382
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,960
for an early sign, a warning sign of

1383
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,119
heart disease. Everyone checks their

1384
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,599
forehead out, right?

1385
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,920
Yes or no?

1386
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,520
Well, you see your forehead anyway.

1387
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,520
All right. What are you looking for when

1388
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,640
you look at your forehead?

1389
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,119
How big it is.

1390
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,480
How big it is. How about you?

1391
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,040
Wrinkles, obviously.

1392
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,760
Wrinkles.

1393
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,720
Yes.

1394
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,599
So, it's interesting. We got two

1395
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,040
different things, right? Size of the

1396
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,400
forehead and where you got wrinkles.

1397
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,000
Here's something that's pretty cool. And

1398
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,079
this is you may not. I got some

1399
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,680
anonymous pictures of the forehead for

1400
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,440
my audience. Come on up. You can help me

1401
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,560
with this. All right. I'm not sure. You

1402
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,560
might be in there even. Stand right

1403
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,920
there. Okay. Now, this is pretty cool.

1404
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,000
So, this is a member of the audience.

1405
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,839
You notice there's no wrinkles at all.

1406
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,880
This is a a youthful forehead. All

1407
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,240
right. This is a very stately forehead,

1408
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,040
right? There's a little bit of of a

1409
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,680
wrinkle here, but not much. Right. And

1410
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,760
then we found this one. All right. Now,

1411
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,160
this is a wise forehead. I actually

1412
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,480
don't mind the the appearance of

1413
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,000
wrinkles, but I am a little concerned

1414
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,440
about what they mean because for

1415
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,119
everyone who has wrinkles, this new

1416
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,359
study says you got to check for deep

1417
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,760
forehead wrinkles like this or it could

1418
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,520
look like this, too. You see this? These

1419
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,040
deep wrinkles, they're important because

1420
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,400
research has found that the deeper your

1421
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,839
forehead wrinkles are, the more likely

1422
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,520
you are to have heart disease like

1423
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,280
atherosclerosis.

1424
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,760
And the reason for that is the forehead

1425
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,960
has very small little blood vessels. And

1426
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,240
so if you have hardening of the

1427
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,319
arteries, those small vessels, they

1428
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,480
block up more rapidly. You'll get cracks

1429
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,720
in your skin, right? These deep lines

1430
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,319
became become creases and it's a sign of

1431
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,599
blood vessel aging. So if it's happening

1432
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,760
in your forehead arteries, it could

1433
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,720
happen in your heart arteries. So you

1434
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,040
all clear on this?

1435
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,400
Yes.

1436
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,839
Right. So it's a good idea to do a quick

1437
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,760
forehead check every once in a while. Do

1438
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,880
it in friends and family. It might help

1439
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,920
you track what's going on inside your

1440
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,200
body. In fact, what you want to do is

1441
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,319
take pictures of your forehead, share

1442
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,839
them with your friends, share them with

1443
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,960
me, do with your other friends. Make
