2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,359
Bruce Jenner has everyone buzzing about

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
transgender. I know this is a a

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,280
difficult conversation to have

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,000
sometimes. But first, meet a woman who

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,559
spent most of her life trapped in a

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,800
man's body. It started when I was around

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:21,199
four and something was was wrong. I

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,840
understanding transgender. You got five

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,000
kids, a wife. Did you worry you were

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,199
going to lose them? Coming up next on

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,399
Dr. Oz.

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,320
Welcome everybody. Bruce Jenner, no

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,239
stranger to the spotlight, an Olympic

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
gold medalist, star of Keeping Up with

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,719
the Kardashians, and now speculated to

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
be the new face of the transgender

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,040
community.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,520
As Bruce's rumored transition moves from

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,680
the tabloid gossip columns to headline

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,680
news, the Olympian and one-time

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
heartthrob could end up becoming the

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,719
most high-profile celebrity to

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,480
transition in the public eye. Jenner's

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,879
journey has been drawing attention for

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,440
the last few months, capped off by

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,840
Jenner's mom, Esther, telling the world

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,799
she's more proud of Bruce now than for

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,119
winning Olympic gold. But Jenner is not

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,840
the only transgender newsmaker in the

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,240
public eye. Actress Leverne Cox became

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400
the first openly transgender person to

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,400
be nominated for an Emmy for her role in

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,799
Orange is the New Black. And the

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
critically acclaimed show Transparent,

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,520
starring actor Jeffrey Tambber as a

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,759
father transitioning to a woman, won two

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,320
Golden Globe Awards this year. My whole

39
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,280
life, I've been dressing up

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,000
like a man.

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,240
This is me.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,880
People who are lesbian, gay, bisexual,

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,119
or transgender. Transgender history was

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,960
also made when President Obama became

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,280
the first American president to

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,439
acknowledge the transgender community in

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,439
his State of the Union address. A

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,280
message sending a clear signal that

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,520
transgender Americans are finally

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,159
stepping into the spotlight and coming

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,159
into their own.

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,040
With all this attention focused on

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,040
transgender people, we want to help

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,119
answer some of your questions about what

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,039
transgender really means and especially

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,800
why some people transition later in

57
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,959
life. And there's no better way to do

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,840
that than to meet a family who is living

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,239
it.

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,239
16 years ago, surrounded by friends,

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,879
family, and their children from previous

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,959
marriages, Tom and Mary took vows to

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,200
spend the rest of their lives together.

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,440
They created a home, blended their

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,280
family. They considered themselves

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,080
soulmates.

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,959
Yet Tom struggled in secret with inner

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,840
conflict. From earliest childhood, Tom

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,640
felt confused about gender and felt like

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,959
a female born in a male body. Through

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,160
the years, those feelings intensified,

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,560
as did Tom's confusion.

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,879
Tom internalized those emotions,

74
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,920
excelling in sports, academics, and

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:02,319
later at his career. All while feeling

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,879
secretly isolated and depressed.

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,760
But 5 years ago, despondent and

78
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,080
increasingly suicidal, Tom decided to

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
face the truth and live openly as a

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,280
woman.

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,159
3 years ago, Tom transitioned to Tina to

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,200
friends and family. A year later, she

83
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,920
came out at work and in public. Today,

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,519
Tina and Mary are still married. And

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,040
look at this one. Look at those

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,720
sideburns.

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,280
And along with their children are

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,080
navigating the waters of their new lives

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,480
together. I love you. I love you, too.

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,920
Please welcome Tina to the show. Tina's

91
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,680
daughter, Evelyn, and wife, Mary, will

92
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,360
join us shortly. I want to thank you

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
first off for coming on. I know this is

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,560
a a difficult conversation to have

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,159
sometimes. Well, thank you for having

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,920
me. It I I enjoy having the

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,200
conversation. So, the big question that

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,280
comes up a lot is you had these gender

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,720
identity issues early in your life. Yet,

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
it took you a good part of your life to

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,680
finally come to grips with it. What was

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
that like? It started when I was around

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,400
four, I think, is when I first became

104
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,680
aware that just something was was wrong.

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,519
I had no idea what it was. Um, and just

106
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,239
over the next 40 years, I really

107
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,440
struggled with a sense that I'm supposed

108
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,360
to be a man, but I just felt I was or

109
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,080
wanted to be a woman. And that just felt

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
very difficult. You you're living a

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,199
life, you mentioned some of the

112
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,880
attributes, but trying to be more of a

113
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,880
man, marrying, having kids, doing things

114
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,320
to try to fit in, yet deep inside

115
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,560
earnestly struggling because you realize

116
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,280
it wasn't real. So, how do you find the

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,280
side that you've struggled enough as a

118
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,680
man and you want to live your authentic

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,040
self? Was there a moment that it finally

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,280
became alive to you? Yeah, I and I I

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,080
think this is common. You you you try

122
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,479
every other explanation. Uh therapy, it

123
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,040
was something my parents did. Oh, maybe

124
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,120
it's supplements if I take supplements.

125
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
Um I mean, I can't think you prayer. You

126
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,880
try a lot of prayer. you you just try

127
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,800
everything and and every year you

128
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,720
eliminate one of those and then finally

129
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,600
you're left with the one thing you

130
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,680
didn't want it to be at the time and um

131
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,600
we I had a night like that where I was

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,680
just very close to suicide and um I

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
didn't attempt it but I just it was very

134
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,639
despondent and I realized

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,720
I needed to redefine victory from

136
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,039
conquering my gender and manning up to

137
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,720
just accepting my gender. um even if I

138
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,600
didn't understand it and it was a weight

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,080
just lifted almost instantly. But at the

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
same time, you must have felt relieved

141
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,199
to be able to to get past that. You got

142
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,479
five kids, a wife. Did you worry you

143
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,160
were going to lose them with this

144
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,639
decision?

145
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,759
Yes. And I probably would have held it

146
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,639
off if I thought I had a choice. But I

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,160
and and I think my wife Mary agreed that

148
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,600
they were going to lose me one way or

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,080
the other and she'd rather keep me

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,199
around this way. And it really came down

151
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,440
to that. I I did not feel

152
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,319
I once you realize that you're being

153
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,919
inauthentic, it's impossible to fake it

154
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,080
anymore.

155
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,680
So this word transition, this is the

156
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
word that I I think most people are

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,080
comfortable enough. We haven't talked

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,240
about it much, but let me if I can

159
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,680
explain what transitioning really means.

160
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
And when I do it with the help of Dr.

161
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,880
Christine McInn is a surgeon who works

162
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
extensively with the transgender

163
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,199
community. Dr. McInn is actually a

164
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:35,160
Tina's doctor. She too is transgender.

165
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,160
Dr. Mcin, please join us.

166
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,360
Thank you very much for coming on again.

167
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,360
So, so if you can, the first question I

168
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,199
think we have to break through is what

169
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,280
causes someone to be transgender? Do we

170
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,319
really know the answer? Well, most

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,919
experts feel that is biologic in origin

172
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,919
and there's a lot of research that

173
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,840
points towards biologic causes. Like

174
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,560
there are some brain studies and and

175
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,960
there's more research every day. Um I

176
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,120
would almost bet my reputation as a as a

177
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,440
surgeon, having seen so many people

178
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,440
transition from different countries and

179
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,520
different cultures, the process is

180
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,440
always the same no matter where they

181
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,400
come from. And that to me speaks to a

182
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,400
biologic uh cause. walk us through the

183
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,160
transition process. What actually

184
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,319
happens when someone begins once they've

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,599
made the insight clear to themselves and

186
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,919
people around them what actually happens

187
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,039
medically? Well, you heard the story

188
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,759
leading up to that. And then uh usually

189
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,599
if they are lucky enough, they get the

190
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,360
idea that to go seek help from somebody

191
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,880
else and and hopefully they'll find a

192
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,520
therapist that uh knows what they're

193
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,520
talking about and the therapist will um

194
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,759
make the diagnosis of gender dysphoria,

195
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,720
but more importantly um give them the

196
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,120
support system to take this journey and

197
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,599
and give them the tools. A lot of times

198
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,319
when people think about transgender

199
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,080
folks making a a change in their lives,

200
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,840
it's it's often thought around surgical

201
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,000
issues, right? You take the penis off,

202
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,080
you make a vagina or vice versa. But

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that's actually apparently not always

204
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,759
done, right? Or not frequently done.

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,280
What holds people back from making that

206
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,199
final decision? What else besides

207
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,680
surgery is part of the transition? Well,

208
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,560
since gender is a self ascribed uh

209
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,319
entity, uh people have different um

210
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,280
ideas about what that means to them. So,

211
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,120
some people they need that uh genital

212
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,440
surgery or maybe sometimes it's removal

213
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
of an Adam's apple to to look in the

214
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,039
mirror and say, "This is how I feel

215
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,800
inside," which is really what gender is

216
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,159
a p private thing. It's not a public

217
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,640
thing. So, Tina, you had the operation

218
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,800
about a year ago. What was it like

219
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,240
immediately afterwards?

220
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,040
It was wonderful. Um, the surgery itself

221
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,519
just felt like surgery. Uh, but

222
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,880
afterwards

223
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,120
I just felt complete. I felt I didn't

224
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,040
have to avert my eyes or or kind of

225
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,399
squint when I looked at myself. I was

226
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,240
just me. It it confirmed I love the word

227
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,440
gender confirmation surgery because it

228
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,800
really I felt confirmed physically. So,

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,399
we've heard how Tina's handled her

230
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,480
transition to live as her authentic

231
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,080
self, but what about her family? It's a

232
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,519
question I've touched on with you. How

233
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,440
are they handling it? Evelyn is here.

234
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,720
She's Tina's oldest child. And Evelyn,

235
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,440
would you mind joining us? And thank you

236
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,440
for being here as well.

237
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,880
Thank you again for coming.

238
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,519
So, Evelyn, for most of your life, the

239
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,440
person next to you was your cool dad. By

240
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,959
the way, she described you as cool.

241
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,480
That's those are her words, right?

242
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,680
athletic, preppy, cool guy, and it's

243
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,080
different now. And what's that

244
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,080
transition been like for you? Uh, it's

245
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,360
been a huge transition for me. I think I

246
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,920
found out about uh the fact that my dad

247
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,399
crossdressed a very long time ago. And

248
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,880
that was pretty easy to accept, but once

249
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,640
I found out uh almost 5 years ago that

250
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,800
that was it, my dad was not going to be

251
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,000
with us anymore. Uh it was it was

252
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,399
incredibly painful. Um the first two

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,800
years uh were just filled with a lot of

254
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,480
tears and a lot of conversations. We

255
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,399
talked all the time. Um

256
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,000
and uh and then seeing the transition to

257
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,680
then you know making the date for the

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,959
surgery everything was was very very

259
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,640
difficult. And then uh once it was all

260
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:25,200
over I actually felt a weight lifted

261
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,320
for Tina. Um, so it and our our our

262
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,680
relationship has gone through a

263
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,160
transition, too, and so we've gotten

264
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,920
closer. Tina, what does Evelyn's love

265
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,839
mean to you to have her express it like

266
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:40,160
that? Oh, everything. Um,

267
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,720
I it just when you're

268
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,600
when you're in the closet, it's it's

269
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,399
like living your entire life behind a

270
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,399
plexiglass. And you because you're

271
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,360
speaking through someone else and people

272
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,200
are speaking to someone else.

273
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,800
And so when they say I love you, you you

274
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,000
don't feel it because they're saying it

275
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,959
to this other person. And it's the first

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,920
time in my entire life I get to feel

277
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,720
that. And that's what for me transition

278
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,040
is about is being connected to the human

279
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,399
race in a way that I never was before.

280
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,040
You have four other children.

281
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,120
Do you ever feel that you left them as a

282
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,839
father and maybe they want that part of

283
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,920
you back?

284
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,680
Oh, yeah. And and there are pieces.

285
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,880
Look, he got me here. Uh, and wonderful.

286
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,320
I I used to tease that he was a man as a

287
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,839
woman would design him. He was pretty

288
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,440
cool.

289
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,600
Um, and and so I miss that at times. I

290
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,600
don't miss at ever. I've not had a

291
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,600
moment where I've missed that. I now

292
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,480
feel me. Uh, and so that was more for me

293
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,480
a stage. You're married to Mary for 16

294
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,279
years. It's a long relationship. How's

295
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,800
her journey been through all this?

296
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:05,279
It's been very tough. Uh, I would tell

297
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,959
people don't try this at home. But, uh,

298
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,839
the irony, right? You can only do it at

299
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,160
home. It's fantastic. But uh but she

300
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,079
stood by me even in her most tearful

301
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,079
moments. There was never any doubt that

302
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,560
she was there for me. But it was a real

303
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,720
struggle for her. It's very painful.

304
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,880
We're very we still are very in love,

305
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,320
but it's it's changed fundamentally.

306
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,720
We're take a break. When we come back,

307
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,240
the woman who married Tom 16 years ago

308
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,000
joins us to talk about her relationship

309
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,000
with Tina today. We'll be right back.

310
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,639
Coming up next, you heard from Tina.

311
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,480
Now, meet her wife, Mary. How she

312
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,959
discovered Tina's true feelings about

313
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
being transgendered, why she chose to

314
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,120
stay married, and what they do together

315
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,720
to make their life and marriage work.

316
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,760
Coming up next, tomorrow on Dr. Oz,

317
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,600
Jennifer Lopez is here. She's revealing

318
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,320
her health and beauty tips for the new

319
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,800
year, her morning ritual, and the big

320
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,639
thing she's into now. That's coming up

321
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:14,320
tomorrow on Dr. Oz.

322
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,959
Tom and Mary White married 16 years ago.

323
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,200
5 years ago, Tom confronted the lifelong

324
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,880
struggle of feeling like a woman trapped

325
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,079
in a man's body, transitioning to Tina 3

326
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,240
years ago. Today, Tina and Mary are

327
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,800
still married and facing the challenges

328
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,519
and complications of their relationship

329
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,279
together.

330
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,440
Talking today about transgender people

331
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,959
and why some transition later in life,

332
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,839
Tina's wife, Mary, is now joining us.

333
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,959
When did you first have an inkling that

334
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,120
your husband at the time, Tom, might

335
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,040
have a gender identity issue? Well, I

336
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,839
didn't know what it was. when we were

337
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,160
dating, he told me that he liked to wear

338
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,160
women's clothes once in a while, but I'd

339
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,360
never have to see it. So, I thought,

340
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,600
well, maybe that's a fetish. And he was

341
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,920
so wonderful that I could probably deal

342
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,639
with that. So, but then that and that

343
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,920
was that was fine for a while. And then

344
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,120
um probably I don't know how long ago it

345
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,639
was cuz it seems like it just happened.

346
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,040
Um, I would see women's shoes much

347
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,160
bigger size than mine, women's clothes

348
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,279
around, um, that were obviously not

349
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,000
mine. And I said, "What what is this

350
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,440
about?" And he said, "Oh, I'm sorry. I

351
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,440
didn't mean for you to see that, but um,

352
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,959
I have to dress once in a while like I I

353
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,839
had told you." Well, this went on for a

354
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,079
while, eb and flow.

355
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,519
He'd fight it. he'd come back, dress as

356
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,560
a woman, fight it, be a man. And then

357
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,040
there was one point that really I

358
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,000
realized this was going to be not going

359
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,959
to last. And she was uh she had come

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,079
home from work. Mhm. She was he at the

361
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,760
time and uh was in the bathroom and the

362
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,040
door was locked, was in there for quite

363
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,040
a long time. And I did not know what was

364
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,240
going on cuz I knew how depressed he

365
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,680
was. So I almost knocked down the door

366
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,760
to see what was going on

367
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,720
and I

368
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,720
he was crying and said, "I'm so sorry."

369
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,639
I sat inside the tub with him and he

370
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
said, "I'm sorry. I just can't live like

371
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,160
this anymore.

372
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,399
I've been fighting it. I'm trying to

373
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,279
fight it and sorry. And I just can't do

374
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,519
it. I have to be

375
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,160
who I am."

376
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,920
And um

377
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,199
I didn't know what I was going to do,

378
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,120
but I did know one thing for sure. I

379
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,560
love I loved him so much. And I cared

380
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,279
about what was going to happen to him

381
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,720
that I'm not going to just run away. I'm

382
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,000
going to see what happens and deal with

383
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,040
it dayto day. And

384
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
when she told me

385
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,079
finally, I guess uh 3 years ago when you

386
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,519
said or two years ago that she's going

387
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:16,959
to go through the transition.

388
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,240
It was not I cried. I cried a lot. I was

389
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:23,279
very depressed for a long time. But then

390
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,639
I thought if if he doesn't do this, I

391
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,160
might lose him as completely and at

392
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,000
least

393
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,079
if he goes through this transition and

394
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,720
becomes who he really is as this

395
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,480
beautiful woman she is.

396
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,639
At least I get to have her here and

397
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,880
she's my best friend. We are soulmates.

398
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,880
It's beautiful.

399
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,759
When you when you broke through the the

400
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,279
bathroom door to get to Tom, obviously,

401
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,360
you know, the thought of suicide we

402
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,079
discussed earlier had come across his

403
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,639
mind. You must have been fearful that he

404
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,800
would act on that. Absolutely. And I saw

405
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,799
how depressed he was and I was worried

406
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,959
that he was going to commit suicide. And

407
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,640
I I don't know for sure, but I feel like

408
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,559
if he wouldn't have done this, he would

409
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,319
have committed suicide and he wouldn't

410
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,880
be here with us.

411
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,880
He's never said that. But well, what do

412
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,640
you I mean you you may not have said in

413
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,400
private, but I am curious. Is was that a

414
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
real possibility? What would you have

415
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,079
done if you hadn't been able to

416
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,400
transition?

417
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,720
People tell me I'm brave. I I I think I

418
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,039
do brave things, but I did this because

419
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,360
I felt back to a wall where I had no

420
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,200
other alternative. And when that is the

421
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,120
alternative, then wearing a dress

422
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,400
suddenly seems very attractive.

423
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,320
Um, but seriously, people people tend to

424
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,120
focus on the dress. And I I can

425
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,960
understand it really is there's nothing

426
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,320
more depressing than having no self that

427
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,919
you can relate to. And in fact, to feel

428
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,480
that you're the one I was doing, the

429
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,840
violence to myself by repressing that.

430
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,000
And I realized I I can never

431
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,520
I I think that's why so many transgender

432
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,679
people commit suicide because they're

433
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,880
just going to the logical conclusion of

434
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,480
what they're doing to themselves

435
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,600
psychologically.

436
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,960
Um what's your marriage like now? It's

437
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,559
wonderful. Uh it's different. Uh we're I

438
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,880
would say we're very intimate but not in

439
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:27,360
a sexual sense. We're um but we've lost

440
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,840
one vocabulary for love and we've come

441
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,520
up with a thousand others. So, in the

442
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,160
way you make coffee for each other, the

443
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,760
way we listen to each other, uh the way

444
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,280
we talk to each other, um we are just a

445
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,919
very loving couple. We are. She's we're

446
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,600
best friends. And I would have never my

447
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,360
my philosophy on being with somebody is,

448
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,880
you know, in marriage or in a

449
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,320
relationship, if you think you're going

450
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,760
to leave that relationship to find

451
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,880
somebody else, that's not a reason to

452
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,039
leave. If you're leaving that

453
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,720
relationship because you cannot stand

454
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,360
being with that person, that's why you

455
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,600
would leave. I tell you, I love her. We

456
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,840
enjoy our life together. We have so much

457
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,480
fun. Didn't your friends, maybe even

458
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,960
your family say, "Leave, Tom. You don't

459
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,919
want to be with Tina?" Absolutely. I had

460
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,720
friends constantly tell me, "Why aren't

461
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,600
you leaving him? Divorce him. You know,

462
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
get on with your life." I'm like,

463
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,919
"Divorce him and go where? And why would

464
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,919
I? I love I love being with her. But I

465
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,000
would say our family was pretty

466
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,640
remarkable. They had difficulty with it.

467
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,640
But what was beautiful for me to see, we

468
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,039
have a very diverse family. She has a

469
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,440
daughter from a previous marriage who

470
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,080
belongs to a very devout um Christian

471
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,799
church, very about as conservative as

472
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,360
you can get. They translate the Bible,

473
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,200
interpret the Bible literally. This was

474
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,440
a real struggle for them. And I worried

475
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,679
that she might lose them for supporting

476
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,480
me. But they really had figured out a

477
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,440
way to honor their faith and you and and

478
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,280
me and me. And you and me for sticking

479
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,679
with her. Sure. Yeah. Uh

480
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,400
there's so many questions that come to

481
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,640
mind about how this all plays out. For

482
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,720
example, do you feel an attraction to

483
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,600
men or to women? It's a great question.

484
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,760
Uh, and it usually takes us, frankly, a

485
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,679
few years to work out the change in our

486
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,320
own heads.

487
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,600
I find men attractive in a way that I

488
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,320
never had before, but I far prefer the

489
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,320
company of women. So, I'd rather be at

490
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,559
the bar with her talking about how cute

491
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,559
you look.

492
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,830
You got me. You got me.

493
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,280
[Laughter]

494
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,559
[Applause]

495
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,320
Well, you know what? what's going on in

496
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,000
a man's head. It's, you know, it's not a

497
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,559
not a happy place sometimes. That's why

498
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,880
I don't think I

499
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,440
uh I while I find men attractive, I

500
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,840
can't I could never see myself if I even

501
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,840
if I weren't married going that far. I

502
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,000
just know too much of men's secrets.

503
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,760
I would love if you would just give the

504
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,520
audience some insights of what you think

505
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,240
is going on in Bruce Jenner's family

506
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,240
right now.

507
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,960
I

508
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,600
I just I I I have a hard time imagining.

509
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,760
Your mind just explodes with all of the

510
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,520
change. And I felt it hard enough. We

511
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,159
felt it hard enough in our neighborhood

512
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,080
and our family managing

513
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,000
a hundred conversations. Um

514
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,440
for for them facing this level of

515
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
publicity, I hope what they're doing is

516
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,480
I hope that Bruce is spending time

517
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,919
thinking about himself, herself. wait

518
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,240
for him to say her, right? Uh and and

519
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,200
their family. Yeah. And it must be so

520
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,400
fearful for his family because, you

521
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,400
know, when we found out what was going

522
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,720
on with her, I had no idea what

523
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,280
transgender meant. It was never in my

524
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,360
vocabulary. And we had to bring so many

525
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,000
people along with us to teach them what

526
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,720
it was about. And here they are in the

527
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,080
spotlight trying to deal with this and

528
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,120
losing their father and who's if that is

529
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,720
the case. It's hard. It's not easy. But

530
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,720
I've learned today that maybe you're

531
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,320
going to lose the father either way.

532
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,960
Exactly. And this is a much happier

533
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,240
ending to the story. I agree 100%. So if

534
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,679
I can speak to the audience on this and

535
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,200
I think people are often fearful and

536
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
judgmental of what they don't know or

537
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,280
understand. And I wanted to share Tina's

538
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,200
story today so everyone can see that

539
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,760
she's just a person trying to live her

540
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,360
authentic life. And I've truly adored

541
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,880
making her acquaintance and and having

542
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,440
this story on our show. I appreciate you

543
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
making the effort. Evelyn Beckin, thank

544
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,990
you as well very much. We'll be right

545
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:44,000
back.

546
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:45,919
[Applause]

547
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,760
Next. Do you want to live a pain-free

548
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,760
life? Before you turn to prescription

549
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,360
drugs, learn from other pain sufferers

550
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,440
who share their best do-it-yourself

551
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,520
remedies, simple solutions to get rid of

552
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,760
your chronic back and neck pain, plus

553
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,760
health shortcuts to simplify your life.

554
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Next,

555
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,679
[Applause]

556
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
one of my biggest missions on this show

557
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,360
is to help you live a pain-free life.

558
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,600
And the good news, it's working because

559
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,600
thousands of formerly chronic bang back

560
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,960
pain sufferers have come forward.

561
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,280
They're saying, "Dr. Oz, I am now

562
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,520
painfree." So, I asked a lot of them to

563
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,039
share how they kicked their back pain to

564
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,640
the curb. And Tanya sent me this

565
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,440
provocative Facebook message. She says,

566
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,919
"Dr. Oz, after so much trial and error,

567
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,159
I finally found something so simple to

568
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,480
get rid of my pain." So, I wanted to

569
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,919
hear about it. So, what is your DIY

570
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,679
solution for back pain that you love so

571
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,200
much? So, have you ever had um like an

572
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,520
ice pack when you went to like a nurse's

573
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,080
office when you're in school or a child?

574
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,520
It's very similar to that. Oh, but it's

575
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,919
sort of free cuz you have all the stuff

576
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,640
at home. Oh, show me. Pray tell. So,

577
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,039
actually here we have two parts water.

578
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,240
There's two cups of water here. And one

579
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,000
cup of rubbing alcohol. Yep. Yep. It's

580
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,679
alcohol. It's alcohol. So, can you pour

581
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,200
that in here for me? So, water goes in

582
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,080
first. Yeah. And then the alcohol. The

583
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,000
alcohol goes in there. And you're going

584
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,280
to want to try to squeeze out as much of

585
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,679
the air as possible.

586
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,279
And how long does it take to freeze? So

587
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,360
you can put it in for like an hour and

588
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,360
it'll be cold enough and maybe not as

589
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,640
solid as this within an hour, but you

590
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
can use it after an hour. That's not too

591
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
solid. That's pretty good. No, it's not.

592
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,360
It's actually more like a gel. And when

593
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,039
it melts, can you refreeze it? I always

594
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,039
refreeze mine. I always have one in the

595
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,679
freezer. What a great money saver.

596
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,120
Fantastic idea. Thank you very, very It

597
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,480
works really well for a bunch of good

598
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,520
reasons. Keeping it in cold helps. Thank

599
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,840
you very much. Thank you so much. All

600
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,200
right. Next, I got Denise. How are you,

601
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,960
Denise? Good. Nice to meet you back.

602
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,720
Denise says that she learned this next

603
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,080
fix for her back pain actually on this

604
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,240
show and it's something called the

605
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,919
pretzel stretch. Pretzel stretch. Yes,

606
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,720
it is. So, how'd you hear about it?

607
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,200
Well, I watch a show quite often and I

608
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,039
go to yoga a lot and I just do it all

609
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,880
the time. You remind me what it is?

610
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,360
Sure. I like the name pretzel stretch.

611
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,559
Pretzel stretch. So, how do we sit? So,

612
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
straight up. Straight. Put your both

613
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,400
legs straight out. One's going to cross

614
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,679
over the little right over left. All

615
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,520
right. You're going to take your right

616
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,120
hand. Hold. No. No. Take your left hand.

617
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,279
Got it backwards. You're confusing me. I

618
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,200
am confused myself. And stretch around.

619
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,960
And you got to go as as far back as you

620
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,480
can. Oh, feels good. You'll feel it on

621
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,919
your back. How long do you hold it for?

622
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,080
I hold it for a few seconds. Probably

623
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,760
about 30 seconds. And then I'll doverse.

624
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,080
And then you do the reverse. It's And

625
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,760
when's your back pain usually worse?

626
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,039
When I wake up in the morning. I love

627
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,720
the fact you're not using prescription

628
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,880
medication. Thank you very much. Thank

629
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,600
you very much, Dr. Appreciate it. Now, I

630
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,520
wanted to share with you some other

631
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,880
DIYs. As I saw, these are three best

632
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,720
health hacks that I saw on Pinterest

633
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
this week. And actually, interestingly,

634
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,039
one of the best things to do for your

635
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,720
back pain has to do with one of these

636
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,000
little tips. It helps you lose weight.

637
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,440
You lose the weight, the back pain gets

638
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,200
better in a lot of people. Great health

639
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,320
hack for is very simple. All you've got

640
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,840
to do, and by the way, health hacks, you

641
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
all know these are simple shortcuts to

642
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,520
make life simpler. They're hopefully

643
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,520
inexpensive and easy to incorporate into

644
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,360
your life. The first health hack is this

645
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,919
marble scale. Look carefully at this.

646
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,760
You put a marble from the one bottle

647
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,159
that's that said pounds to go into the

648
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,520
other one that says pounds lost. Move it

649
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,120
from one jar to the next. And of course,

650
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,799
if you gain weight, you take it back.

651
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,039
Pounds lost, go back in the pounds to

652
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,720
go. It's a great visual motivator so you

653
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
can watch your progress. The next health

654
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,720
hack that I found on Pinterest. Really

655
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,400
enjoy this. Aluminum foil dryer balls.

656
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,919
Great DIY solution for doing laundry

657
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,520
because guess what? Dryer sheets can be

658
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,440
expensive. They've got lots of chemicals

659
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,120
in them. A ball of aluminum foil can

660
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,480
prevent static cling and they last for

661
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,720
months. You keep throwing the darn thing

662
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
in there and they really work. But this

663
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,919
last one is probably one of my favorites

664
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,440
because I use it myself. I'm going to

665
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,480
show you how to ripen an avocado. I

666
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,600
don't know how many of you had this

667
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,200
experience. You go to the store, you buy

668
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,799
an avocado and it's going to be ripe in

669
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,559
about a week, right? But you want to

670
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,000
make the, you know, the dish that you

671
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,679
want to make that day or the next day.

672
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,919
So, what you do is you take this avocado

673
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,799
and you take a banana and you put it in

674
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,559
a brown bag overnight. If you do that,

675
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,640
the avocado ripens. You can make a

676
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,880
guacamole. And how does this happen? I'm

677
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,880
going to do a little test right here.

678
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,279
This one I did myself. I've got these

679
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,880
were bought the same time, same place,

680
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,400
right? And I want to take a Who wants to

681
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,080
judge these for me? Who judges us? You

682
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,320
want to judge her? Squeeze the Charmin

683
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,159
here. Squeeze these and tell me, is

684
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,200
there a difference? Yes, definitely. We

685
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,880
could use this one right now. You could.

686
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Isn't that amazing? Bought the same

687
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,840
time. All the frustration, angst of your

688
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,520
life gone with a simple paper. Really?

689
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,240
Thank Thank you very much. Listen, I've

690
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,000
added my top tips on backbolutions to my

691
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,960
Clipix. That's one of my favorite tools

692
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,640
on the web. And you can head to

693
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,600
clipix.com/draws

694
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:31,359
to see it right now. I'll be right back.

695
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,359
[Applause]

696
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,440
Coming up next. You've always heard that

697
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,080
drinking water is good for you, but can

698
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,080
too much be a bad thing? We may becoming

699
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,919
aquaholics and getting sick from

700
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,520
drinking more than we need. How much

701
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,400
water is really the right amount for

702
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,600
your body? Coming up next

703
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,840
tomorrow on Dr. Oz. Jennifer Lopez is

704
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,919
here. She's revealing her health and

705
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,320
beauty tips for the new year, her

706
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,880
morning ritual, and the big thing she's

707
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,200
into now. That's coming up tomorrow on

708
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,200
Dr. Oz.

709
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,059
[Applause]

710
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,880
As we all do things to better our

711
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,200
health, there's growing concern we could

712
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,279
be doing too much of a good thing. Some

713
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,159
experts are now saying drinking too much

714
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,760
water could be making us sick. And it's

715
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,279
leading to a whole new term. You may

716
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,440
have heard it, aquaholics.

717
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,840
Adding more water to our diets has

718
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,240
become increasingly popular. As a

719
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,679
nation, we drink over 1 billion glasses

720
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,799
of water a day, 38% more than we did in

721
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,799
the 1990s. With more and more diet and

722
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,520
fitness experts stressing the importance

723
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,000
of water for health, sales of bottled

724
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,320
water has skyrocketed to an astonishing

725
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,559
12 billion dollars annually with some

726
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,279
people taking their H2O intake to

727
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,320
extremes. But I wanted to show you the

728
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,880
5Q container that I fill up every day

729
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,039
with water and sometimes I find myself

730
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,600
actually filling it up again at night.

731
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,279
This is my 24 oz jug and we're going to

732
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,240
do some workout. Fill this up three

733
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,640
times and chug chug chug. Yet, some

734
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,960
experts now worry that drinking extreme

735
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,720
amounts of water can create its own

736
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,799
health hazards, contributing to

737
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,360
everything from bloating and nausea to

738
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,120
frequent urination and poor sleep. Could

739
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,039
you be putting yourself at risk for

740
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,159
these health problems by drinking too

741
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,240
much water?

742
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,279
Joanna Lenell are joining me. So, Joan,

743
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,880
let's go back to the very beginning of

744
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,679
all this thing. When when did you start

745
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,279
drinking this much water? About four

746
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,360
years ago, I decided I needed to lose

747
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:39,039
weight. So, I was told drinking water

748
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:42,240
would help me. So, I drank water and I

749
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,080
just continued and it worked. So, I just

750
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,320
kept drinking more and more water and

751
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,840
now I'm addicted. Addicted to water. I

752
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,720
really am. My water goes with me

753
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,440
wherever I go. Elena, how about you?

754
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,480
Well, about 5 years ago, Dr. Oz, I had a

755
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,799
cancer scare. Uh, fortunately, it was

756
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,039
benign. Good. And so that's when I

757
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:05,440
started drinking a lot of water, getting

758
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:08,399
on a more healthy regimen, and um now I

759
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,600
just chug chug chug. So I I just I saw

760
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,200
the jugs you all brought with you. And

761
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,200
Lenel, you brought a couple of the the

762
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,720
pictures you use. You drink two of these

763
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,880
before a workout. Is that really I think

764
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,039
I drink the 24 ounce. Two of these

765
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,600
before workout and then two after a

766
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,840
workout. That can't feel good. It's a

767
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,399
lot of water in your belly. Yeah. And um

768
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,279
Yeah. And it does kind of lead to a

769
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:34,080
little nausea, but I don't stop. So, I'm

770
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,080
definitely, I guess, addicted. Okay.

771
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,840
Okay. And Joanne, you you brought this.

772
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,520
This is gargantuous. A five quart

773
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,679
container. Is that right? I love my

774
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,799
container. It's very attractive. How

775
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,320
does all that water affect you?

776
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:51,440
Negatively. Um, unfortunately, I don't

777
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,799
sleep much. I have to wake up at least

778
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,360
two, three times in the middle of the

779
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,279
night. Yeah. I can only sleep about two

780
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,799
and a half hours um straight at once.

781
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,399
I'm tired when I wake up, of course,

782
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,760
because I'm not getting straight sleep.

783
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:09,279
Sure. And also, um I need to find the

784
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,919
ladies room wherever I go. Wherever. I

785
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,919
mean, I find myself crossing my legs,

786
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,799
which I'm sure so many women can

787
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,679
empathize with me just to hold it in.

788
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,640
And I've even had a bad incident once

789
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,399
where Yes. I What kind of a bad

790
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,200
incident? That doesn't sound good. I

791
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:31,360
did. I did. I um I could not hold it in.

792
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,080
I was out shopping

793
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:38,799
and I actually broke the hand dryer in

794
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,640
the ladies room of a store trying to dry

795
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,279
my pants.

796
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,320
That's a bad embarrassing. All right.

797
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,399
So, let's talk about this word

798
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,320
aquaholic. Okay. It's being used a fair

799
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,720
amount. It's not a clinical diagnosis.

800
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,159
Uh it's more like a disordered behavior,

801
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,519
but something that obviously has some

802
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,000
side effects. We want to deal with it.

803
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,320
And you both have said you sort of feel

804
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,640
addicted to the stuff. You have to have

805
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,159
it with you. Yes. Is that true, Joan?

806
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,480
Yes. Bring those goodies. Come on over,

807
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,640
Lynel, as well. I'm going to show you

808
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,320
with those trusty water containers

809
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,679
everything that you're doing. So, first

810
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,200
off, if you don't mind, pick the table

811
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,799
with your name on it. You'll see why in

812
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,080
a second. And we've been saying for

813
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,000
years, everybody, you want to get eight

814
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,159
glasses of water a day, right? Eight

815
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,919
glasses of water looks like this. And

816
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:24,000
you know even this we can talk about in

817
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:27,279
a second but in comparison Lenel this is

818
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,440
you with about 20 glasses of water. It's

819
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,880
a big difference between the two tables.

820
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,039
Definitely. If I can move one a little

821
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,039
further look at the 25 Joan that you

822
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,000
have in comparison a day. Does that

823
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,760
frighten you to see the difference

824
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,039
between what we generally think is the

825
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,200
right amount of water and what you guys

826
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,840
are taking in? Definitely. I I mean

827
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,720
because now it's so visual that I can

828
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,760
see I'm probably overdoing it. But then

829
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,519
how do I stop because I I take this like

830
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,880
everywhere? Well, I give you one little

831
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,720
tip. Do you want to take a little

832
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,880
dispenser of yours and put put some in a

833
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,880
cup there? I think one of the smartest

834
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,159
things to do is to drink your water from

835
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
a cup so you actually know what you're

836
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,039
getting. Like anything else, listen,

837
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,320
water is great for you. I want you to

838
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,760
drink water. Please don't take us the

839
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,320
wrong way, America. Keep getting your

840
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,640
water. I want you to visualize the right

841
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,840
amount of intake so you feel your best.

842
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,679
You can live your best life and still

843
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,279
get the benefit of the water because a

844
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,679
lot of people don't drink enough. So

845
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,360
using that cup and eight of those in a

846
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,120
day is a way of thinking it through.

847
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,880
Frankly, carting around that five C

848
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,240
container is like carting around a a

849
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,159
gallon a ton of ice cream. I don't cart

850
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,440
this around with me, Dr. This goes in my

851
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,320
refrigerator. Oh, good. I feel better

852
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,960
now. Oh, no, no, no. Jeez. The subway

853
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,559
with the I fill this up every morning. I

854
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,519
put lemons in it. It goes in my

855
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,559
refrigerator and I actually fill up.

856
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,519
Yes, I fill up my water. Okay. Be

857
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,679
pushing people away from you with that

858
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,440
cart. All right. So, I'm going to toast

859
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,519
to you.

860
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,120
I'll grab one of these, too. To the

861
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,960
right amount of water. And now, let me

862
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,320
explain to you and everybody at home

863
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,159
what the right amount of water is

864
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,320
because it's not eight glasses of water

865
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,760
either. That was an old idea. We've got

866
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,600
better ways of thinking about this. So,

867
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,200
let's get into those details. So instead

868
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,880
of the eight glasses a day, which is

869
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,200
what we used to say based on information

870
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,399
from literally Second World War, that we

871
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,000
don't think that's the best way of

872
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,000
taking your water from now on. It's not

873
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,440
a one-sizefits-all game. We all use

874
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,200
different amounts of water. So I'm going

875
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,679
to give you rules of thumb unless you're

876
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,280
sick that you can use. And it starts off

877
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,879
with trusting your body because when

878
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,879
you're thirsty, you should get a glass

879
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,919
of water. Then look at the color of your

880
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,119
urine. And we've talked a little bit

881
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,919
about this, but I'll make it really

882
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,440
vivid. It should be the color of pale

883
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,119
straw,

884
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,560
light yellow color like that. I don't

885
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,320
want it any darker than that. That means

886
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,159
you got plenty of stuff to wash out any

887
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,919
toxins that are in your body. One last

888
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,520
little tip, especially for the Jo-Ann's

889
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,839
of the world who aren't sleeping, I want

890
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,359
you to limit your water within two to

891
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,960
three hours of your bedtime. Does not

892
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,480
affect your sleep. Make sure you train

893
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,839
yourself like you do your pets. Go to

894
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,359
the bathroom right before you get in bed

895
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,720
so you can get uninterrupted sleep

896
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,720
throughout the night. We'll be right

897
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,720

Coming up next, love a good

899

old-fashioned pancake but hate all the

900
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,079
carbs? Give these breakfast favorites a

901
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,400

whoever said a doctor's visit isn't fun

Oz Nation are flipping for high protein

912
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,320
pancakes. A typical pancake, believe it

913
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,400
or not, has as much as Whoa.

914
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,800
One more time.

915
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,839
I I've been working on this that many

916
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,280
grams of carbs. 28 g of carbs. But now,

917
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,960
home cooks are cutting the bad with

918
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,200
ingredients like protein powder and

919
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,079
peanut butter and egg whites and small

920
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,400
changes can cut the carb amount by a

921
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,880
whopping

922
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,599
67%.

923
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,119
So, today we have home cooks from the Oz

924
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,040
Nation here to compete for the best high

925
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,800
protein pancake to keep you full for

926
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,560
hours. Now, my med unit has been working

927
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,200
hard through the night calculating which

928
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,520
pancake is lowest in carbs and highest

929
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,320
in protein and flavor. And our finalists

930
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,599
are eagerly awaiting the results. Are

931
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,200
you ready? There they are. Very. Are you

932
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,480
guys all nervous? Yes. Baited. They're

933
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,920
all desirous of the coveted Golden

934
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:34,040
Spatula Award. In third place is

935
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,040
Valerie. Come on down, Valerie.

936
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,040
Welcome to the show. Bal. You can put

937
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,000
your pancakes down there and I'll adorn

938
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,119
you with your bronze medal, so to speak.

939
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,920
So, what do you got in here? Tell me

940
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,599
about it. I made strawberries and cream

941
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,440
protein pancakes. Now, how do you make

942
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,480
them? It's real simple. It's just four

943
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,599
ingredients. Uh 3/4 scoop of protein

944
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,800
powder, four egg whites,

945
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,640
raw oats, and um unsweetened almond

946
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,240
milk. You just mix it all together and

947
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,599
top it with some fresh strawberries or

948
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,000
you can even put the strawberries

949
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,320
inside. You know, first of all, kudos to

950
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,440
you for realizing that protein powder is

951
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,880
not just about shakes. So, you can use

952
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,720
it in a lot of different foods. And

953
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,040
we're also proud of the fact we have 10

954
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,160
g of protein in this pancake, which cuts

955
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,440
the carbs about 64%. Good for you.

956
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:28,200
Congratulations. All right, second place

957
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,200
is Denise. Come on down, Denise.

958
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,960
Oh, look at the joy on your face. Look

959
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,160
at that. I love you. I love you, too. I

960
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,760
love you, too. Oh my goodness. I just

961
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,359
love that. What a pretty smile. Ain't

962
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,760
that great? All right. So, what you put

963
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,400
in your protein pancakes? Um, today, um,

964
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,960
I made banana cinnamon protein pancakes,

965
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,079
and it has a half a scoop of protein

966
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,640
powder, eggs, egg whites, banana, and

967
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,320
Greek yogurt because our daughter

968
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,640
Jackie, she's 12 years old, but she

969
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,560
loves Greek yogurt. So, I love to add

970
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,280
that. I'm going to taste it and see what

971
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,760
it tastes like. Can't wait. Here. Was

972
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,079
the recipe yours? You make it up? Uh, I

973
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,160
have a large Italian family and we like

974
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,000
to eat and trade recipes. So, that's one

975
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,359
of the recipes that was traded. Tell you

976
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,119
what, I like it because it's got a

977
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,200
little bit of a punch to it. It's nice.

978
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,280
They're also little thinner and I like

979
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,720
that as well. So, 12 grams of protein on

980
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,560
this one, which is why you did so well

981
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,280
in the ranking and reducing carbo

982
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,440
carbohydrates by 59%.

983
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,800
And the cinnamon is a great idea because

984
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,320
it helps your body deal with the sugar

985
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,760
that's all going to be in the syrup more

986
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,680
effectively. So, congratulations. Oh,

987
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,599
thank you so much. Are we all ready? The

988
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,560
moment has arrived, everybody. It is

989
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:44,560
time to award the best protein pancake

990
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:48,960
maker. And the winner of the Golden

991
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:53,240
Spatula Award, are you ready? It is

992
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,240
Dawn. Come on down, Don.

993
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,839
Oh, I'll hold that up. That put this on

994
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,000
first so I can hear you. And there's

995
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,200
your golden spatula. I made this myself,

996
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,200
by the way. It's It's actually not

997
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,200
really golden. I mean, it's golden, but

998
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,400
not gold. Beautiful. But it will it will

999
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,000
So, tell me about your pancake. How'd

1000
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,800
you make it? Well, I made peanut butter

1001
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,640
protein pancakes. Um, peanut butter

1002
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,119
protein. So, extra protein with the

1003
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,440
peanut butter. Yes, exactly. Um, I put

1004
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,520
in a half a scoop of peanut of protein

1005
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,800
powder, cottage cheese, um, raw oats,

1006
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,000
and egg whites. Cottage cheese. Cottage

1007
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,599
cheese. We always have cottage cheese at

1008
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,280
home. So, I figured I'd throw that in

1009
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,480
one day and it came out delicious. Yeah,

1010
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,480
I taste a little bit of just the right

1011
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,640
amount. I mean, it's a crazy concept.

1012
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,320
Cottage cheese and pancakes, right? But

1013
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,400
it's innovative. It's incredibly tasty.

1014
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,599
They were all tasty, by the way. So,

1015
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,000
yours had 12 grams of protein. Wow. And

1016
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,839
a whopping 67% reduction in

1017
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,920
carbohydrates.

1018
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,760
A little bit. I can say this. You have a

1019
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,640
few more calories in yours than the

1020
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,320
other ones, but you traded out basically

1021
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,520
simple carbohydrates with no benefit for

1022
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,359
a little extra fat. I'll take that

1023
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,359
trade-off any day. Congratulations to

1024
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,680
you to all my competitors. You can find

1025
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,520

1029
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:22,000
[Applause]

1030
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,440
Tomorrow on Dr. Oz. Superstar Jennifer

1031
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,200
Lopez is here. I'm excited to be on Dr.

1032
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,760
Oz. Her beauty, that body. Jayla reveals

1033
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,560
how she keeps it all together. You ever

1034
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,119
look at your urine?

1035
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,599
That's the first time in 10,000

1036
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,920
interviews that I've done in my life

1037
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,440
that anybody asked me the color of my

1038
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,200
teeth.

1039
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,200
That's coming up tomorrow on Dr. Oz.

1040
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:55,040
[Applause]

1041
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,800
So, do you know there's actually a

1042
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,240
scientific fact that you actually do

1043
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,000
look better in sunglasses? Don't you

1044
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,240
like that? Sunglasses help make your

1045
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,599
face look very even on both sides. And

1046
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,200
that's one of the most important factors

1047
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,640
we rank when we try and figure out

1048
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,400
what's a beautiful face and not, which

1049
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,240
is pure symmetry. So, there are lots of

1050
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,160
surgeons now who wear sunglasses in the

1051
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,440
operating room, not to be cool, but

1052
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,119
actually to protect their eyes from

1053
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,960
lasers. So, I was intrigued when I came

1054
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,480
across these high-tech sheets. These

1055
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,480
aren't just any sunglasses. They

1056
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,800
originally created for laser surgeons,

1057
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,119
but they were accidentally found to

1058
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,720
correct color blindness. So, that same

1059
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,640
vision technology is making its way into

1060
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,800
sunglasses. It may help as many as 80%

1061
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,119
of people who are color blind. What do

1062
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,880
you guys think?

1063
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,560
Looking good and feeling good. Last time

1064
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,160
for in case you missed it. First, one of

1065
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,240
the most provocative conversations I've

1066
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,240
ever had in the show is a middle-aged

1067
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,520
person like Tina. There are lots of

1068
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,240
folks who have been making the decision

1069
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,160
to undergo a gender transition. But what

1070
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,200
seems like one person's choice is in

1071
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,119
