solve. We have clues. You've all been

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,639
exposed to something, but no answers. At

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,639
some point, you're starting to think,

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,719
what's happening to us? How friends from

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,560
one university all found themselves

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,880
battling the same life-threatening

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,039
disease? Is this just a coincidence or

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,439
is there something more going on here?

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,039
medical community and a call to action

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,960
for all of you watching to help solve

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,120
it. Now, pay attention because we're

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
about to lay out for you the clues to

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,079
help explain why these friends from one

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,640
university all found themselves battling

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,880
the same life-threatening disease. Take

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,520
a

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,200
look. Julie, Allison, and Ashley met at

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,000
Auburn University in 1989. They lived in

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,400
the same dormatory. After graduation,

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,600
they stayed in touch. Then, something

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,240
mysterious happened. One by one, they

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,280
were all diagnosed with a rare form of

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,520
eye cancer. When I was 27 years old, I

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,240
started seeing these flashes of light

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,759
and a year later, I was diagnosed with

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,079
ocular melanoma. Then in 2001, Allison

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,159
was stricken. I was seeing about mild

36
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,759
flashes of light for about 7 to 10 days

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,040
and then after about 10 days realized I

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,000
had lost a little vision in my right

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,399
eye. And finally, Ashley. I was standing

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
in my doctor's office and um when I was

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,759
diagnosed and I told him I said you know

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,759
this is so unusual because I know two

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,280
people who I went to Auburn with who had

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,960
this cancer and had their eye removed

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,880
and he said that's almost impossible

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,040
this is so rare and that's when I knew

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,119
that this was this was probably a very

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,200
unique and unusual thing.

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,200
Ashley, Julie and Allison are here today

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280
to talk about this medical phenomenon

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
that has shaken the lives of these best

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,280
friends. So Ashley, if I can start with

53
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,280
you, you mentioned that you felt

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,640
something weird at the diagnosis, but

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,040
how weird is it to be sitting with your

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,200
college friends, dormates, Yeah. who all

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,959
have the exact same disease, the same

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,520
problem? You know what's interesting is

59
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,800
this is such a rare cancer. Um, six out

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
of a million people have it. And so when

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
I was diagnosed, six out of a million.

62
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,400
Six out of a million. What are the odds

63
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,080
of three in the same school? Exactly.

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
And our ages and being there at the same

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
time. And I was actually diagnosed I

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,680
lived in Memphis, Tennessee at the time.

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,160
And I just remember after talking with

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,519
my doctor at the shock of it, you know,

69
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
but at the same time I stood there, I

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,640
said, you know what's crazy is I I know

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
two of the girls that I went to school

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,920
with and and I remember him saying

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
that's impossible. Like it's just too

74
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
rare. I said, "No, they both had their

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,840
eye removed and I was able to come home

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,120
right after diagnosis. I called both of

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,400
them, you know, found their numbers in

78
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
Birmingham because I again I lived in

79
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,959
Memphis and they were wonderful. So I

80
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,640
just feel very blessed to be surrounded

81
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,840
by them because they're sweet friends.

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,159
We talk to each other all the time,

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,760
almost daily. we text or or call. Sure.

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,400
This brings you together. It forges you

85
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,319
together. It does. You notice. Yeah.

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,640
Please. And I mean, a big part of this

87
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,599
story is obviously supporting each

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,959
other, but part of it is also why all

89
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,120
three of you, and we're going to learn

90
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,040
later even more interesting parts of the

91
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,319
story come to the forefront. But Joel,

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,400
you noticed that you had a a a spark of

93
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,760
light, right? A little a flash, I think

94
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
you called it. That's right. What was

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,799
that like? And how did it come on? Well,

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,319
at the time I was 27 years old and um I

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,640
just started seeing in my peripheral

98
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,879
vision just a flash of light almost like

99
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,040
you get up too fast um in my peripheral

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,280
vision. So I went to the doctor and they

101
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,200
just they assured me that it was more

102
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,799
called Moors lightning flashes and that

103
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,040
it would last four to six weeks and

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,040
should be gone after that. Um but it

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,040
continued and and seemed to be more

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,239
persistent and happened more frequently

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,319
and then I I became pregnant and then

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,640
once I got further in my pregnancy they

109
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,959
said oh it's pregnancy related and so

110
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,439
after you have this baby I'm sure that

111
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,360
these symptoms will go away but when my

112
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
baby was 6 weeks old I went back to the

113
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,440
doctor and because they had not gone

114
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,680
away in fact I had some blurred vision

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,440
you know that um that occurred as well

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,280
and that's when I was diagnosed with an

117
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,600
with a tumor with an ocular melanoma

118
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,960
with a sixe old. A six week old. Okay.

119
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
That's right. And with a significant

120
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,479
delay because no one would have expected

121
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,960
it. That's right. And also, you had

122
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,520
those same flashes. I did. So, did you

123
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,960
did you call your friends? What? How did

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
you It was about a year and a half after

125
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,639
Julie was diagnosed and we we had been

126
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
praying for her for a year and a half.

127
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,560
So, I immediately called her when I got

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,040
in the car after they diagnosed me. I

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,040
had had flashes of light for 7 to 10

130
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
days and towards the end of the 10 days,

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,880
lost partial vision in my right eye. Oh

132
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
my goodness. So went thinking it was a

133
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,479
retinal detachment to have my retina

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,639
repaired. And as they looked in they

135
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,960
said, "Well, there's a 10 millimeter

136
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,560
tumor sitting on your retina." So let me

137
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,000
just show these are the medical charts

138
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
for all three of you for the audience to

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,639
look at actually more with you because

140
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,840
you know your stories, right? And I put

141
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,759
them all up there because I want you to

142
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,240
see the symptoms and the treatments and

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,800
there's some similarities including the

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,639
fact that you all had your eyes removed

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,840
which is often done for this. So, let's

146
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
talk a little bit about this because you

147
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,880
first of all, I'm really happy you stuck

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,080
together because it's going to allow us

149
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,680
to get to the next part of the story,

150
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,800
but I want to do something else. You

151
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,479
know, there are hundreds of people

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,919
around the country, hundreds of people

153
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,680
who apparently are supporting you right

154
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,880
now and a lot of them actually flew in

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,880
today. Yes. Put your hands up. Put your

156
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,080
hands up if you have ocular melanoma.

157
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,240
There's a lot of folks and I got to say

158
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,320
it is it's very rewarding to me as a

159
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,800
physician to understand that if I do

160
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,120
what I'm trained to do which is try to

161
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,280
diagnose and treat you'll have social

162
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
support around you to lift you up and do

163
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,400
what I sometimes can't do which is give

164
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,759
you confidence and and make sure you see

165
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
the opportunities out there in your life

166
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,320
and Alison I know this has been

167
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
difficult for you because your tumor

168
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,240
spread to if I understand correctly 17

169
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
parts of your body. Yes. So, how do you

170
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,479
stay so upbeat when I I know you're

171
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
struggling with that reality? Well, it's

172
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,600
totally the Lord for sure. The prayer

173
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,039
that has carried us through. Well, those

174
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,400
stories that faith comes us in many ways

175
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,560
and I think you're sitting next to a

176
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,919
couple people who represent that. So,

177
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,720
let me get us all on the story because

178
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,400
this is a mystery in to me still. And

179
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,880
over the course of this show today, I'm

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,639
going to ask you to look for patterns to

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,800
be part of this because you're maybe

182
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,240
living in a similar pattern yourself.

183
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
Just like these women and doctors have

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,360
been struggling to find out what's going

185
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,960
on. I'm going to recount. We've got

186
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,560
three women. You just met them, right?

187
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,160
They're all living, all these three

188
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,319
women in the same dorm on the campus of

189
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Auburn University in the late 80s. So,

190
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,800
what happened when these women started

191
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,800
to tell people what was going on,

192
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,240
especially using social media? Stay

193
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,240
tuned as this medical mystery unfolds.

194
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,800
Is chicken the new brain food?

195
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,000
We know omega-3s can be found in fish,

196
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,080
but chicken you feel smarter now. Yeah.

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,720
All new

198
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:18,160
Oas. That's coming up on Monday. This is

199
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,199
Julie, Ashley, and Allison. They all

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
went to the same

201
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,240
university, lived in the same dorm

202
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,240
around the same time of each

203
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,759
other, and now they've mysteriously all

204
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,680
ended up getting this rare form of eye

205
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:39,360
cancer. Wow. I'm trying to figure out

206
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,919
how this happened and could there

207
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,840
possibly be more people.

208
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,599
My producers and medical unit have been

209
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,520
hard at work trying to unravel this

210
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,120
medical mystery. a group of college

211
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,759
friends all ending up with the same

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,479
cancer. Were there more or is this just

213
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,879
a coincidence? Well, Ashley posted on

214
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,840
Facebook and people who went to the same

215
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,960
university started coming out of the

216
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,720
woodwork. 30 people in total. 30 all

217
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,080
diagnosed with ocular

218
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,919
melanoma. So, I want to introduce one of

219
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,160
those people to you. Lori also attended

220
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,720
Auburn University in the late 80s. She

221
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,080
saw Ashley's Facebook post and it I

222
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,000
guess you got a chill down your spine if

223
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,080
I understand correctly. Lori, it was

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,080
awakening. You know, you um I had a

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,199
friend of mine who actually saw her post

226
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,800
and then she sent me the link. She said,

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,800
you know, you you need to check into

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,200
this. Um unlike them, I did not have

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,560
this camaraderie of knowing anybody. So,

230
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,680
I was navigating all of this on my own.

231
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,839
So, what did Auburn University say when

232
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,560
you informed them that there were 30

233
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
graduates who are all suffering from the

234
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,080
same kind of eye cancer, ocular

235
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,360
melanoma? Um, the university got

236
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
involved and they appointed an

237
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,720
incredible man that we're all thrilled

238
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,959
with. His name is Dr. Fred Cam. He has a

239
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
medical clinic on campus and basically

240
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,320
Dr. Cam went to the university and they

241
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,920
said, "We we need to be a part of this.

242
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
We need to help fund some of this

243
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,360
research. We need to see what's going

244
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,120
on." So, we actually reached out to

245
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,640
Auburn. wanted to hear what they had to

246
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,640
say. They offered the statement to us.

247
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,560
OPER will continue to participate,

248
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,480
support the Alabama Department of Public

249
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
Health and melanoma experts as they

250
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,680
determine what next steps should be

251
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,920
taken in the best interests of the

252
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,200
patients. Good for them. So, in cases

253
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,640
like this, medical professionals

254
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,920
collaborate with health officials. It's

255
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,839
not easy, right? Because you're you got

256
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,440
doctors know about eye tumors and you've

257
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,279
got health officials know about the

258
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,120
epidemiology, the environment that we're

259
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,120
all living in. Dr. Dr. Marina Olaf is an

260
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,120
oncologist who has treated some of these

261
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,200
women and is actively working with

262
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
health officials to solve this medical

263
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,120
mystery. So explain what a cancer

264
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,959
cluster is. What what what has to happen

265
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,600
for you to be able to call it a cancer

266
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,680
cluster? Yeah. So a cancer cluster has a

267
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,839
very strict definition. If you want to

268
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,519
look at the number of observed cases, so

269
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,360
how many people are actually diagnosed

270
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,120
versus what the expected number of cases

271
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,040
is for a very specific uh location. Um,

272
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,800
and unfortunately we haven't really been

273
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
able to apply those statistics to these

274
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,959
scenarios because not everyone was

275
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,959
living in the specific location of

276
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,800
concern at the time of their diagnosis.

277
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,040
So we think there's probably about a 10

278
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,360
to 15 year lag time between potentially

279
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,120
a mutual exposure if there was one and

280
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,560
the development of the cancer. But the

281
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,000
way you traditionally look at cancer

282
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,839
clusters does not take that into

283
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,399
consideration. So we've had to develop

284
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,839
our own uh unique way of of looking at

285
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,240
this. So here's why I'm concerned. These

286
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,600
are factors and you you might be exposed

287
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,000
to one of these or not like nuclear

288
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,000
waste, radioactive material, even RF

289
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,440
waves, radio frequency, water to water

290
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,720
could be a problem, other toxins, the

291
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,480
environment, power lines and power

292
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,560
plants come up all the time as do cell

293
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
towers these days, landfills, even

294
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760
things like as specialists which we know

295
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,600
are correlated. So as an expert and you

296
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,320
look at these things, how does a viewer

297
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,000
know if all their friends are getting

298
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
sick because you've all been exposed to

299
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,839
something that you might be prone to

300
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,600
also? Yeah. So that's when we've really

301
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,120
put a big team together. So it's not

302
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,279
just myself, it's not just the medical

303
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,640
oncologists um you know both in

304
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,079
Philadelphia, we worked with our

305
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,160
colleagues down in North Carolina at

306
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,160
Duke and now our colleagues in Alabama

307
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,760
to really put together a thorough

308
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,040
investigation and looking at these

309
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,800
things. So the first thing you need to

310
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,000
do is put everybody at the same place at

311
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,240
the same time. So that's part of the

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,680
geospatial analysis and once you can do

313
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,279
that and that goes through interviews.

314
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,640
So it's well where did you live? Well,

315
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,480
how much time did you spend there? Well,

316
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,320
where were you working? Where you know

317
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,160
did you play a sport? What fields were

318
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
you playing on? Um, and then you can

319
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,560
actually overly any concerns that there

320
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,399
may be in any of these environmental

321
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,079
concerns. And so then when you put that

322
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,760
all of that together and there's any red

323
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,839
flags, then we can actually go delve

324
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,120
deeper down um to see if there's any

325
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
potential cause. So let me give everyone

326
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,839
a little bit of advice on this. If you

327
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
suspect a cancer cluster in your

328
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,800
community, talk to your doctor first.

329
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
Let them know because they'll talk to

330
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,160
the other doctors. And more importantly,

331
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,760
become your own detective. Start your

332
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,440
own investigation. You just saw the

333
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,760
power of social media and it can help

334
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,519
you too. What I what I'm talking about,

335
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,600
right? And and that's a perfect example

336
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,200
of something happened at my office as we

337
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
began researching this show. Literally

338
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,200
take a look what happened when one of my

339
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,760
directors read the script. Just saw the

340
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,360
script for this show.

341
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,519
I read your script this morning and I

342
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,680
immediately went on Facebook and tagged

343
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,480
everybody I know from my college breast

344
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,720
cancer. Me and so far I found five other

345
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,880
people who went to my school, either

346
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,360
lived in my dorm or another dorm. And

347
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,120
I'm investigating to see who else. I've

348
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,920
tagged everybody I know to see if I

349
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,760
could find more people. Can a brain scan

350
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,920
reveal if you're a psychopath? The

351
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,360
daughter of a serial killer faces her

352
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,520
darkest fears. All new Oz. That's coming

353
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,360
up on

354
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,800
[Music]

355
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,320
Tuesday. When you get a scary medical

356
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,079
diagnosis, one of the first thoughts

357
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,920
that leaps to your mind is, "How did

358
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,079
this happen? How'd this happen to me?"

359
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,240
Well, when these four college friends

360
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,000
found out they were among 30 people from

361
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,279
their former university that had come

362
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,680
down with the exact same kind of eye

363
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,240
cancer, they got together. They made the

364
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,320
medical mystery their mission. They're

365
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,399
here today with an important message for

366
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,560
you. I'm going to start with Dr. John

367
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,480
Mason who's an opthalmologist who's also

368
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,079
on the task force looking for clues to

369
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,720
understand how 30 people from Auburn

370
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,720
University all got diagnosed with ocular

371
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,399
melanoma kind of eye cancer. So, let's

372
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,320
look for more clues. Help us with this.

373
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,560
So as you look at this, who's more

374
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
likely to get eye cancer taking

375
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,000
everybody into account? Yeah, we know

376
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,560
that about 2,000 cases in our country

377
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,079
occur per year. 7,000 worldwide is

378
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
typically patients that are light

379
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,959
complexed, fair complexed, patients that

380
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
are typically between the ages of 50 and

381
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,560
65. Can be younger, can be older. I've

382
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,880
treated teenagers with this. All these

383
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,519
women were younger. Absolutely. So

384
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,360
that's not unusual. Often blue-eyed,

385
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,760
greeneyed rather than browneyed. Yeah.

386
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,279
So again, light complexion, blue eyes.

387
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,360
And what about the issue of exposure to

388
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,959
the sun? That's debatable. That is

389
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,279
debatable. Half the studies have shown

390
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
that UV exposure is related. Half the

391
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,360
studies have shown that UV exposure is

392
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,959
not related to ocular melanoma despite

393
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,240
the light colored eyes. That's true. All

394
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,360
right. And what about hazardous

395
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,639
chemicals which is something that comes

396
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,480
up always when you worry about these

397
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,760
cancer occurrences that are more

398
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,519
frequent than you expect. Yeah. The

399
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,839
unique thing about ocular melanoma is we

400
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,160
have never identified an environmental

401
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,079
trigger. We do not know what in the

402
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,760
environment causes ocular melanoma.

403
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,600
That's the purpose of the study. That's

404
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,440
why we want to do the study. Then

405
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,120
perhaps we can find an answer. It's

406
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
going to be one of four answers. So it

407
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,839
either be environmental, genetics, a

408
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,079
combination of both or coincidental. But

409
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,480
we need the study. These ladies deserve

410
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,240
the study. A lot of folks aren't going

411
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,000
to get symptoms. Yeah. This is going to

412
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,920
save lives. That's why we're doing the

413
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,560
show today. It's not It's a mystery that

414
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,839
actually leads to lives being saved. If

415
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,040
you're sitting at home right now and

416
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,959
you're worried you've got a problem with

417
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,720
your eye, even a tumor, what do you do?

418
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,320
What do you recommend? I think uh every

419
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,519
single patient in our country needs an

420
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,680
annual eye exam, a dilated eye exam. We

421
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,160
need we can see diabetes in the eye,

422
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,279
hypertension in the eye, glaucoma,

423
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,120
melanoma, a host of diseases. The eye is

424
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,880
a window to the world. All right. So get

425
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,639
an eye exam with the drop so it dilates

426
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,440
it. Absolutely. Thank you very much. All

427
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,560
right. There's going to be someone

428
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,000
watching today that may have gone to the

429
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,040
same school with friends who developed a

430
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,639
similar cancer. Maybe they went to

431
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,680
Auburn and have ocular melanoma. So may

432
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,440
actually let me finish with you since

433
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,040
you posted this out here and we're going

434
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,519
to put the m melanoma patient from

435
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,959
Auburn on our dr.com site. So folks are

436
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
out there. There's the page right now.

437
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,079
You know, let us know. Let's help solve

438
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,079
this mystery. Let's give the doctors

439
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,839
some tools to figure out what's causing

440
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,079
this. What is your biggest hope actually

441
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,079
going forward? So we have a a website.

442
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,959
It's called

443
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:26,880
ipatchchallenge.org. And and people are

444
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,399
familiar with the ice bucket challenge.

445
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
We have something called the eye patch

446
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,600
challenge. And we actually want to

447
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,800
challenge you today. Oh. So we have

448
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,680
something for you. Lori wants to give

449
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:41,920
you ice. We have an eye patch and our um

450
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,279
Yes. So, the premise behind the eye

451
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,120
patch challenge is that we want to

452
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,639
encourage people to to raise awareness

453
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,760
and to raise funds for the research

454
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,519
we're doing at Auburn. What do you

455
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,079
think? I like it. I like it. And they

456
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,839
try to

457
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,399
do I look diabolical? Very much so. Very

458
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,519
much so. So, um, the idea is that we are

459
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,360
going to challenge you to do something

460
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
with the eye patch on to help raise

461
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
awareness and then to also challenge

462
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,000
someone else, you know, nominate someone

463
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,880
else to do this. Um, you can go on

464
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,639
patchchallenge.org and make a donation

465
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,160
for the research that we're being that's

466
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,440
being done at Auburn, which we

467
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,839
appreciate. I'm going to go do something

468
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,120
sportive with my kids, leaving the odds

469
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,880
out. Thank you for what you've done. I'm

470
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,240
very proud of you for getting together,

471
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,720
for being brave, for supporting each

472
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,000
other, but also finding the cure. This

473
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,440
is how we're going to change health in

474
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,519
America. It's stories like this. God

475
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,639
bless you. For all the melanoma patients

476
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,399
in the back, God bless you. We're going

477
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,480
to share resources on how and when to

478
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,330
get your eyes checked on dr.com. I'll be

479
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,429
right back with my

480
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,429
[Music]

481
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,560
patch. Up next, today's show anchor

482
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,920
Savannah Guthrie is here with a big

483
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,480
health question that all of you are

484
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:51,000
asking, and it is, why can't I stay

485
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,000
asleep? Stick around.

486
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,600
I recently heard one of my friends who

487
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,759
you all love, today's show anchor

488
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,920
Savannah Guthrie, had a big question

489
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,360
about sleep for me. Now, we all know she

490
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,520
wakes up extra early to bring you the

491
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,959
biggest news of the day, and recently

492
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,880
she's been having a little sleep

493
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,079
struggle that you can all relate to.

494
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
Come on out, Savannah

495
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,439
Guthrie. I know.

496
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,600
Hi. I'm so happy you are here. I know.

497
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,400
Hi. They've been waiting for you with Hi

498
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,640
everybody. Nice to see you. So happy you

499
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,240
are here. I'm so happy to be here. This

500
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,760
is my first time on your show. You've

501
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,360
been on the first time. I know you've

502
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,679
been on the Today's Show. We have you

503
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,600
every week. But well, we have lots of

504
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,520
good excuses to talk to you today. That

505
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,679
look like a rough rough night of sleep.

506
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,880
Is that typical? Yes, it is. I mean,

507
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,280
that could have been last night. the

508
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,440
snoring husband. Sorry, sweetie. The the

509
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,919
crying baby and then the early wakeup

510
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,360
call. And I It happens. I mean, I I

511
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,120
mean, I think every person who works on

512
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,280
these kind of morning shifts probably

513
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,799
doesn't get enough sleep, but I I just

514
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,039
have a hard time falling back asleep

515
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,039
once I anything wakes up. I'm like, my

516
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,120
mind starts working. And the thing is,

517
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,720
we all watch you at 7 a.m. promptly on

518
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,640
the day show. You look so chipper, so

519
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,039
awake. You get up at 4 in the morning.

520
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,520
How do you do that? Well, coffee. You

521
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,280
know, coffee is big. Um, you know, I

522
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,880
trudge in with my hair wet and in my

523
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
sweats and they like perform a miracle

524
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,679
in the hair and makeup department. I

525
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,760
don't know what they do, but they make

526
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,000
me look presentable. And I also think

527
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,919
there's just there's a natural energy

528
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,160
and excitement that you just kind of you

529
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,240
get up for it. So, before you became a

530
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,280
mom? Yeah. Were you able to sleep

531
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,039
better? Yes. I mean, yes, I think I did.

532
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,120
I mean, even when I worked in news and

533
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,559
I'd have these early morning gigs, I

534
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,559
wouldn't sleep that much, but I could

535
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,799
sleep well. And once I fell asleep, I

536
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,640
was dead to the world. Now, I mean, I

537
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,200
was just thinking about it. I My kids

538
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,799
wake up pretty much every night. You get

539
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,000
two kids, like the chances of both

540
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,200
sleeping are almost like impossible. So,

541
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
when they wake up, they go back to sleep

542
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,080
again. But waking up in the middle of

543
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,919
the night is so common among our

544
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,600
viewers. Yeah. Well, there first of all,

545
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,039
anybody who works on a morning show is

546
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
obsessed with sleep. It's like all you

547
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,440
talk about. You think about when am I

548
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,880
going to sleep? Am I going to get a

549
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,320
chance to have a nap? Like, I'm the most

550
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,919
boring person in the world. I only want

551
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,000
to talk about sleep. But I have a few

552
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,600
tricks. I have earplugs that I use. And

553
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
then I do have like a few little tricks

554
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,160
to calm myself. First of all, never ever

555
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,320
check your phone. Like what I did in

556
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,840
that video is the absolute worst thing

557
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,200
to do. Yeah, that bright light turns off

558
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,559
any little bit of melatonin you might be

559
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,400
making. Yes. And then you see the time

560
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,480
and there's probably a text message that

561
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
comes up or a news alert and it just

562
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,880
gets the wheels turning. So I try really

563
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
hard. I actually put an alarm clock next

564
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,559
to my bed so that I could just look at a

565
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,520
regular clock to see the time and not

566
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,600
have to tap the phone. So, uh, I do that

567
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,440
and then I have I have I actually have a

568
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,840
Bible verse I memorized when I was 12

569
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,400
years old. Goodness. Psalm 23 and I say

570
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,160
it to myself and I almost always I'm

571
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,039
kind of falling to sleep by the end by

572
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,559
the time I've said it times. Oh, the

573
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,919
whole thing. No, just a little bit. Oh,

574
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,600
you know, the Lord is my shepherd. I

575
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,320
shall not want. He makes me lay down in

576
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,480
green pastures. He leads me beside the

577
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,919
still waters. He restores my soul. It's

578
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,080
a very pastoral and calming song. But I

579
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,320
think if you know I happen to learn that

580
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,640
as a 12-year-old kid, but anything that

581
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,160
you memorized, there's something about

582
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,000
reciting it to yourself in your mind

583
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,919
that calms you. It works for me every

584
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,679
time. Yeah, it's meditative. Come on

585
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,000
over here. You actually allowed us to

586
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,679
pry into the to your brain a little bit

587
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
and look into your sleep score. So, if

588
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,120
you stand right over here, I'm going to

589
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,120
put the sleep score up here. Okay.

590
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Again, it's just it's a simple little

591
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,280
way of a cool app. Yeah, I know. I like

592
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,120
it, too. So, you actually did really

593
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,960
well. I was shocked at this. I think I

594
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,799
had a terrible night's sleep last night

595
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,640
and I got a 79. You did? But I'll tell

596
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,720
you why I got a 79. It was interesting.

597
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,039
Yeah. C++. Ju just to break it down.

598
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,400
C++. Right. Just to break it down, a

599
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,640
couple things. First of your body score

600
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,640
was only a 52. What does that mean? So

601
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
it if you look at how you sleep, not all

602
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,600
parts of sleep help you the same amount.

603
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,000
The part of sleep that's most important

604
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,679
for your brain is the REM sleep, your

605
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,039
dream sleep. And you just knock the

606
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,640
further these lines are over, the better

607
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,559
off you did. So look how well you did

608
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,080
with your REM, which is just fantastic.

609
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,080
your deep sleep, which is important for

610
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,480
your body, wasn't so good. So, you got a

611
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,720
52 in your body score, but you had 97 in

612
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,720
your mind. So, that's a pretty good

613
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,400
number. Okay. So, net net, the only

614
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,520
thing I'd work on is deep sleep. And the

615
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,960
only way to get more deep sleep for you

616
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,559
probably is to sleep longer, to be in

617
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,559
bed longer, which I know is hard. I

618
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,080
would like to do that. I'm for that.

619
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,880
What if we started the Today Show at

620
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,799
9:00 a.m. That's be so much easier if

621
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,559
you want to watch.

622
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,159
The other thing that happens with sleep

623
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,240
issues, especially if your body is not

624
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,320
sleeping well, is you'll feel tired. you

625
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,120
feel and actually we were talking uh

626
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,240
socially at a separate uh gathering and

627
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,000
you mentioned you were on the on the

628
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,760
paleo diet keto diet. The keto diet.

629
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,559
Yes. I I did a little summer experiment.

630
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,000
I saw you at a party and you were like

631
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,520
you're on the keto diet. I said yeah I

632
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,360
don't know if I'm in ketosis. Can I tell

633
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,960
everybody what you said? Yes. I it was

634
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,640
so embarrassing. He goes, "Well, breathe

635
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,000
on me." And I'm like, "I don't want to

636
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,280
breathe on you. I'm at a party. That's

637
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,799
so rude." He's like, "Breathe on me."

638
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,559
And then he said, "You're not in keto."

639
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,000
Because one of the things is supposedly

640
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,840
have bad breath when you're in keto. You

641
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,520
smell like acetone. You'll be I didn't

642
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,640
have bad breath, right? No, you dealt

643
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,559
very well with it. No, my breath was

644
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,799
like tequila. That's why. That's why.

645
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,080
Exactly. Did you Did you like being on

646
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,840
the keto diet? You know what? I liked

647
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,200
it. I I you know, I mean, I'm not really

648
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,960
trying to like lose weight or anything,

649
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,320
but you know, we might overeat and

650
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,000
you're like, I like to lose two, three

651
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,080
pounds, 5 lbs. So, I did it and I did

652
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,159
like it. Um, and I'm still kind of doing

653
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,000
it. It's, you know, it's a lot of meat

654
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,440
and cheese and like it's like meat

655
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
salad, you know? It's like salad and

656
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,799
some grilled chicken, but you can get

657
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,080
more fat, which is kind of fun. So, in

658
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,480
some ways that you have to deprive

659
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,559
yourself. no carbs whatsoever and that's

660
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,919
really restrictive, but it's opened up

661
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,840
some things that I would never let

662
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,400
myself eat a lot of such as like cheese

663
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,720
and bacon. So, I like that. Do you feel

664
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,320
energized on it? You know, I don't I

665
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,760
feel less energy in the sense of like I

666
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,760
don't want to work out anymore. I don't

667
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,679
feel any I think I need those carbs to

668
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,840
want to go on a run or do aerobics or do

669
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,480
whatever I might do. But Hodis says she

670
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,120
thinks it's making me my mind sharper.

671
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Like I was remembering things that were

672
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,760
kind of sh like she's like, "How do you

673
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,679
even know that?" I'd be like, "Oh, that

674
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,039
was on page 252 of that book." She's

675
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
like, "Where's this coming from? This

676
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,480
keto diet's insane." So, I do feel like

677
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,760
it made me a little sharper. Well,

678
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,559
that's part of the process, I think, is

679
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,000
you know, you experiment with these

680
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,520
diets, not just to lose weight, is to be

681
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,880
able to match it up with the rest of

682
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,080
your lifestyle. This being a good

683
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,840
example of why you're sharp, that might

684
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,559
be an additional one. However, if I want

685
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,440
to improve deep sleep and I want you to

686
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,799
access your body score better, since I

687
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,480
can't get you to lie in bed more, I'm

688
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,760
going to try some food hacks. Okay.

689
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,280
You're up for it. I of course. All

690
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,799
right. When we come back, we investigate

691
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,640
what are the best foods to eat for

692
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,600
sleep. And I think I found out the truth

693
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,090
about Savannah's secret obsession. Stay

694
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,190
tuned.

695
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,190
[Applause]

696
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,400
We know omega-3s can be found in fish,

697
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,200
but chicken, you feel smarter now. Yeah.

698
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,200
All new Oz. That's coming up on

699
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,120
[Music]

700
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,320
Monday. We are back on today's show.

701
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,919
anchor Savannah Guthrie and we're

702
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,760
investigating what foods you can eat to

703
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,120
get you a more restful night. But first,

704
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,840
I want to show something that Savannah

705
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,320
posted on Instagram that I loved and my

706
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,320
wife especially appreciated.

707
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,840
When is it okay to ask women if she is

708
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,679
pregnant? Oh my god. And notice the

709
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,080
answers. For the first seven months,

710
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,919
it's no. And after that, it's also no.

711
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,679
Why? Why' you post this? I would add

712
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,159
like if you're in the hospital actually

713
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,600
giving birth, it's still no. Don't ask

714
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,200
are you pregnant? Not until you hear the

715
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,440
baby cry. No. What? Not until the

716
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,600
child's an adult. Exactly. You know what

717
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,120
I mean? I I posted it because from time

718
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,240
to time people might on Twitter or

719
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,400
something say like, "Oh, are you

720
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,840
expecting again?" Which no, I'm not. And

721
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,600
you know, but I did have two babies and

722
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,840
I'm 46 years old, so you know, I don't

723
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,840
have like a washboard abs or anything.

724
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Um, but I wore this polkadotted dress

725
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,760
one day and suddenly I guess it wasn't

726
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,440
the most flattering dress ever because

727
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,960
the whole internet was like, "Savannah's

728
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,480
pregnant. Are you hiding? Your bun in

729
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,679
the oven?" Blah blah blah. Which of

730
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,760
course I thought the dress looked good.

731
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,520
I had to go then burn it. And um, that's

732
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,039
when I posted it up. I was like, "Yeah,

733
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,880
no." So, I think it's just a good rule

734
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,799
of thumb. No matter what a woman looks

735
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,559
like, let them tell you she's pregnant.

736
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,600
You don't need to ask. You all agree

737
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,120
with that, right? Yeah. All right. Let's

738
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,240
talk about sleeps and quick fixes. First

739
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,760
off, what time do you normally have

740
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,320
dinner? You got to be in bed by 10:00.

741
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,400
So, bed by 10? I go to bed by 8. Oh, you

742
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,600
do? Yes, I have to. Oh, no wonder you

743
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,960
did so well on your sleep score. I was

744
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
surprised. Oh, yeah. Well, I get in bed

745
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,240
by 8. I might not be able to fall asleep

746
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,480
till 9 or so, but my kids go to bed at

747
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,520
7:00, so we all eat dinner around 6:00.

748
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,600
Um 600 6:30. So 2 hours before bedtime.

749
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,799
Yeah. By 700 I should I'm not eating.

750
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,400
Yeah. All right. Come on over. Let's

751
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,640
talk about some specific foods. I'm

752
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,120
basically on a toddler schedule. That's

753
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,480
right. So Snoozy salmon. The first

754
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,919
recommendation. We talk about salmon for

755
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,200
almost everything having to do with the

756
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,200
heart, the brain, everything else. It

757
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,279
turns out that it has B vitamins in it,

758
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,279
which is how your brain makes serotonin,

759
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,640
which is of course a tryptophan, which

760
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,720
is of course the key ingredient that

761
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,159
turkey has in it that makes you tired.

762
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,840
Okay. So if I have salmon for dinner,

763
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,360
it'll help. It will help. And you want

764
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,400
to get it at least three hours before if

765
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,440
you can only because you have time to

766
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,279
digest it and get it to your brain. At

767
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,840
least three I should stop eating two

768
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,679
hours before. Okay? But give your brain

769
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,039
at least three hours to absorb whatever

770
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,240
nutrients you want to give it. That's

771
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,400
general rule of thumb. Even if you take

772
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,159
melatonin, you got to take it early

773
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,840
enough that it can get into your brain.

774
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,279
Oh. So when people take it at two in the

775
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,320
morning, it's not going to work at 2:15.

776
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,400
I'm always like, "That doesn't work for

777
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,679
me." No. Okay. Now I know. All right.

778
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,480
That was good. Should I try it? No, you

779
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,480
don't have to. How do you cook your

780
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,000
salmon? Um, well, I'm not a big chef, as

781
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,760
you may know, Dr. eyes from watching the

782
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,600
Today Show, but I usually would grill

783
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,720
it. My favorite, too. All right, next

784
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,279
up. This is my favorite favorite

785
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,960
favorite thing. Tart cherry juice.

786
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,799
Really? Because I mentioned melatonin

787
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,279
earlier. This is the best food source

788
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,880
for it. And my father grew up on a tart

789
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,480
cherry farm in the central Turkey,

790
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,760
Anatolia. You're kidding. And that's

791
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,840
where I learned to drink and fall in

792
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,320
love with this beverage. One cup a

793
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,200
night. Okay. Really? You a whole cup?

794
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,720
You don't have to drink the whole cup,

795
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,480
but ideally the studies have shown that

796
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,679
when you drink a cup worth of it, you'll

797
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,880
get better quality sleep during the

798
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,320
evening. Now, is that real sugary?

799
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,760
Should I be worried about pecking on the

800
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,600
pounds? Which is why it should be your

801
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,279
alternative drink for the day if you're

802
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,520
going to make it. However, I what I

803
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,760
generally do just do a shot of it. But I

804
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,520
take it like this if you'll join me. Is

805
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,400
that a shot ski? This is a shotski.

806
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,320
Okay. I knew See, it's Dr. Oz after

807
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,320
dark. Are you ready doing it? Okay.

808
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Ready?

809
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,880
It's very good. Andy Cohen, eat your

810
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,799
heart out. Seriously, he's going to be

811
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,559
so jealous of us. I bet we got you put a

812
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,240
little tequila in there, too. No, that's

813
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,640
a a woman after my heart. I know, right?

814
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Woman after my heart. That was good.

815
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,880
Now, that's my favorite, but this will

816
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,840
surprise you the most. Okay. Kiwi. Yeah.

817
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,919
I don't know what your thoughts are on

818
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,679
it, but kiwi has actually been studied

819
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,919
and it helps the quality and the

820
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,279
quantity of sleep. Both, which is most

821
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,840
things haven't been proven to do both.

822
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,039
This does that. Kiwi, if you're going to

823
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,640
really do it the right way, the way they

824
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,200
do it in New Zealand, you have to eat

825
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,400
the skin, though. Isn't the skin hairy?

826
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,400
Well, I want you to try. This is a

827
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,320
special kind of golden kiwi. Okay,

828
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,840
that's uh a little thinner skinned.

829
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,200
Okay, and you get all the folate if you

830
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,200
do this, by the way. More fiber, 50%.

831
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,520
Not bad. Not bad. Like I might do it

832
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,200
again or never again will I try never

833
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,600
again. This is my first and last kiwi.

834
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,640
No, it's good. It's kind of It's tart,

835
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,399
but I The skin is not pleasant. Well, I

836
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,520
always think about eating fruit the way

837
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,880
people eat it where they actually grow

838
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,760
it. If they're eating the skin in New

839
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,760
Zealand, that's what Okay, good. It's

840
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,320
like eating the skin of an apple. Now,

841
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,080
but I'll leave this for you. I bring up

842
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,559
key reason part because I know that you

843
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,320
were infatuated by pineapples, all kinds

844
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,159
of fruit, by pineapples in particular.

845
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,279
And I finally know why. It's because

846
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,240
there's this person, Princess Penelopey

847
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,720
Pineapple. Yes, she is the star of all

848
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,960
Savannah's books. And not only is she

849
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,480
named after the fruit, but she's got all

850
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,840
kinds of cool things around her,

851
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,440
including other princesses like Princess

852
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,960
Strawberry, Princess Blueberry. Yes. And

853
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,960
I love the adventure so much that I sent

854
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,720
the book to my daughter Daphne. And

855
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,760
Daphne actually read it to my kids, my

856
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,159
grandkids. Take a look. Okay, we are.

857
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,039
We're going to read it right now.

858
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:58,320
Princesses save the world. Princesses

859
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,720
save the world. Your name is Princess

860
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,799
Save the World. Penny encouraged the

861
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,960
princesses to look for anything fragrant

862
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,440
that might work as a hook. Out of their

863
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,640
bags, they pulled all things smelly.

864
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,159
Perfume, peppermints, peanut butter, and

865
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,080
jelly.

866
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,660
It's the greatest book ever. It's our

867
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,159
favorite.

868
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,120
[Applause]

869
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,640
They gave it two thumbs up. The greatest

870
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,080
book ever. I've never gotten anything

871
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,000
like that out of Felo. She's the

872
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,279
toughest critic. Well, thank you, Felo.

873
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,960
What a little doll. Well, you write

874
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,799
about like heart disease and stuff. Yes,

875
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,159
this is more gripping. It's so cute.

876
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,279
Thank you, Daffhne. Beautifully

877
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,720
illustrated. Well done. But there's a

878
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,320
deeper meaning to the book which I think

879
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,840
is why Daphne liked reading it to the

880
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,799
kids over and over again. Would you

881
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,320
share that with the audience? Yeah. You

882
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,600
know, it's funny. So, this all came out,

883
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,360
my friend and I that wrote it together.

884
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,960
We both have daughters and our daughters

885
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,320
were into princesses and we're like,

886
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,399
where does this come from? You know, and

887
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,080
what does it all mean? We are not anti-

888
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,000
princess. We're all about the glitter

889
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,640
and the fun. In fact, this cover is full

890
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,320
of glitter. Um, but the idea was like,

891
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,600
how can we make a princess who's a girl

892
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,520
of substance? You know, when you think

893
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,200
about what a princess is, it's a young

894
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,720
lady in a leadership role. And so, we

895
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,559
kind of came up with this idea. Princess

896
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,919
Penelopey Pineapple. And in the first

897
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,840
book, which is called Princesses Wear

898
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,360
Pants, it's all about she's a girly

899
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,799
girl. She has her tears and her gowns,

900
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,399
but she's got things to do. And when she

901
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,000
has things to do, she wears her pants.

902
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,600
And in Princesses Save the World, we

903
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,279
meet some of her fellow princesses from

904
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,799
the other fruit kingdoms. Princess

905
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,640
Strawberry, Princess Apple, Princess

906
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,640
Plum. They all get together and solve a

907
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,080
problem, a big problem, a world-saving

908
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,520
problem. But here's the part that I like

909
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,399
the most. You actually pay tribute to

910
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,640
the sweetest member of the ecosystem,

911
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,760
bees. That's right. And I actually have

912
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:37,279
beehives. I beekeeper. Yes. There I am

913
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,200
with my son Oliver. Yep. And we just

914
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,360
harvested

915
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,279
our newest honey. Oh my gosh. The

916
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,080
private stash from my Oh my goodness.

917
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:49,279
This is so exciting.

918
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,600
Dr. Oz honey. I'm so Do I get to keep

919
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,080
this? It's yours. It's not pasteurized.

920
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,600
It's a medicine. Honey was the oldest

921
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,960
medicine known by doctors. You know

922
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,320
what's funny? my little boy's sick and

923
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,919
my doctor told me last night, give him a

924
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,760
little spoonful of honey before bed and

925
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,919
now I have really special honey to do

926
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,600
that with. I love you. Thank you,

927
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,279
Savannah. Thank you so much. Be sure to

928
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,440

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,480
stores today and very well done. Thank

931
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,480
you very much, my dear. Be right back.

932
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Pleasure.

933
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,159
Can a brain scan reveal if you're a

934
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,640
psychopath? The daughter of a serial

935
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,159
killer faces her darkest fears. All new

936
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,250
Oz.

937
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,770
That's coming up on

938
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,049
[Music]

939
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,049
[Applause]

940
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:35,840
Tuesday. Roughly 26 million Americans

941
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,000
suffer from asthma. But not everyone's

942
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,480
asthma is the same. There's a severe

943
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,200
kind of asthma. It's called eocinophilic

944
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,799
asthma or e asthma for short. And today

945
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,360
I want to help you understand if your

946
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,880
asthma could be severe easthma and what

947
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,960
you can do about it. Here to help

948
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,480
explain is Dr. Amina Ramirez who's here

949
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,799
on behalf of my trusted sponsorship

950
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,399
partner Astroenica. Thanks for being

951
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,840
here. Good morning. Good morning. All

952
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,480
right. So explain what easthma is. Easma

953
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,799
or eosinaphilic asthma is a is a kind of

954
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,000
severe asthma. Uh and there are many

955
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,480
different kinds of asthma. The

956
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,080
eosinaphil is a type of white blood cell

957
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,399
that's a normal part of our immune

958
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,080
system. But for some people with severe

959
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,240
asthma, eosinaphils can cause

960
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,840
inflammation in the airways. Yeah. So,

961
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,760
the question is, could that be you? To

962
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,440
help determine if your asthma could be e

963
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,679
asthma, Dr. Ramirez is going to walk us

964
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,679
through a four question quiz. Everyone

965
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,600
at home, please follow along with this.

966
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,960
This is an area that's rapidly changing,

967
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,240
so we want to try to keep up with it.

968
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
So, walk us through the questions.

969
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,440
Number one, do you often use your rescue

970
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,720
inhaler to control your asthma symptoms?

971
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,640
Yes or no? It's pretty simple. There

972
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,279
only four questions. Question number

973
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,120
two, do your asthma symptoms wake you up

974
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,440
in the middle of the night?

975
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,440
Question number three,

976
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,039
have you ever taken oral steroids for

977
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,240
your asthma? That's an important one.

978
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,399
Again, think carefully about yourself,

979
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,720
but also people who are dear to you. And

980
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,960
question number four, have your asthma

981
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,440
attacks ever led to an urgent care or

982
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,760
emergency room visit. Okay. Now, if you

983
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,679
answered yes to one or more of these

984
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,840
questions, your asthma may be

985
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,200
uncontrolled and you might have severe

986
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,720
eosinophilic asthma or easthma. So, I

987
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,080
didn't know that much about this when I

988
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,440
first started to study this, but I've

989
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,760
learned quite a bit. So, please explain

990
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,559
to everybody how common this really is.

991
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,960
Well, up to about 50% of people with

992
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,279
severe asthma have elevated eosinaphils

993
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,960
in their airways. Half of the people.

994
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,320
So, let me explain to you all what this

995
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,080
really means with animation that I want

996
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,799
you to meet somebody. So, this is what

997
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,279
might happen to your body if you have

998
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,480
come join me over here. Yes. So, let's

999
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,880
just say you take a deep breath in,

1000
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,000
right? And a healthy airway goes the air

1001
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,240
goes through your mouth, through your

1002
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,960
nose, through the the trachea, goes into

1003
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,320
the lungs, right? But in asthma, you can

1004
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,880
have triggers like for pollen, for

1005
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,640
example, enter the airway and it causes

1006
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,640
swelling and a mucous buildup. See this

1007
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,480
green mucus buildup, right? And that can

1008
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,640
limit air flow and lead to an asthma

1009
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,960
attack where you're gasping for air. But

1010
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,559
when you have easthma, you may have

1011
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,399
abundance of these little things, these

1012
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,760
purple eosinophils, that's what they're

1013
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,760
called. They're a special type of white

1014
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,000
blood cell that enters the lungs and can

1015
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,000
cause inflammation, right? And that's

1016
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,359
why sometimes we again we don't know why

1017
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,919
some people are more likely to get e

1018
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,440
asthma. But these cells can be activated

1019
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,960
after exposure to the triggers you know

1020
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,359
about things like pollen and dander and

1021
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,040
dust and mold viruses hot and cold

1022
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,399
weather which is why you can sometimes

1023
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,480
get attacks and understand what's going

1024
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,119
on. So how can you find out if your

1025
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,520
asthma is of this eocinophilic type the

1026
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,960
the e asthma? Well, getting a simple

1027
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,960
blood test that can be done by your

1028
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,560
doctor is a very good start. And

1029
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,159
depending upon the results, you'd see an

1030
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,520
allergist or pulmonologist who would

1031
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,079
make the official diagnosis of

1032
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,399
eosinophilic asthma based on your

1033
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,839
specific medical history, examination,

1034
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,280
and lab test and then be able to

1035
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,119
prescribe the appropriate course of

1036
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,720
action. Great. So, I want you to meet

1037
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,320
someone now because no one knows more

1038
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,399
about how this blood test can help with

1039
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,359
the right diagnosis than Kosh who's here

1040
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,679
on behalf of Astroenica. So you took

1041
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,200
some steps to regain your health and one

1042
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,599
of those steps is really important was

1043
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,359
to understand that she actually had this

1044
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,760
type of of e asthma. So what were the

1045
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,720
symptoms that you were experiencing? Uh

1046
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,520
Dr. Oz uh my asthma was impacting my

1047
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,560
day-to-day life. I was struggling to go

1048
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,160
upstairs to my second floor for 8 years.

1049
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,400
I did not have energy at all. and we

1050
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,400
would go on vacations and people would

1051
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,880
go on hikes and they would uh be um on

1052
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,400
top of the uh hike and I would be the

1053
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,440
very last person taking inhalers and I

1054
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,200
found myself taking inhalers uh rescue

1055
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,520
inhalers and uh use several uh allergy

1056
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,880
pills but nothing seems to be helping

1057
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,880
and my asthma was not well controlled. I

1058
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,040
was having asthma attacks and having

1059
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,200
trouble breathing. So how has your life

1060
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,560
changed now that you realize you have e

1061
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,920
asthma and are trying a different

1062
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,280
treatment approach? Dr. Oz, now my life

1063
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,320
has changed for better. I have uh e

1064
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,400
asthma is well controlled. I did not

1065
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,200
know that uh that people have e asthma

1066
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,480
and I didn't know either and a lot of

1067
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,359
people don't. So when I learned that my

1068
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:16,160
asthma uh was e asthma and my

1069
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:18,320
eosinaphils were high uh I was excited

1070
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,079
to talk about my treatment option with

1071
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:25,760
my doctor and because I was so miserable

1072
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,320
with my uh asthma and my current

1073
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,200
treatment plan was not working. So

1074
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,320
knowing the root cause of my asthma and

1075
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,720
being able to find the uh right

1076
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,400
medication that worked for me best made

1077
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,440
me feel powerful and I was uh more

1078
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,839
controlled. Um my asthma was well

1079
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,720
controlled. I can breathe better. I made

1080
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:52,800
it a point to use my stairs bathroom for

1081
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,720
showers. I enjoy going on walks. I uh

1082
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,280
take stairs as much as I can and I just

1083
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,280
uh it's been amazing. You feel like

1084
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,520
you're your old self again. I feel like

1085
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,599
my old self again. I can go back doing

1086
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,359
things that I used to. I'm very happy

1087
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,160
for you. Thank you very much so much.

1088

Thank you. Great. Thank you very much.

1089
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,240

1094
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,680
This segment was brought to you by

00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,040
Astroenica. Is chicken the new brain

1096
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:36,320

Yeah. All new Oz. That's coming up on

1099
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,520
Monday.

1100
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:57,119
[Music]

1101
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,680
I love this video. Baby Shark has gone

1102
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,680
viral with nearly 2 billion views on

1103
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,359
that video alone. And kids, adults

1104
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,440
across the world are singing and

1105
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,760
dancing. The Baby Shark and post on

1106
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,920
their Baby Shark challenge videos all

1107
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,160
over social media. I want to show you my

1108
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,440
grandkids, Felo and John John, just this

1109
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,040
past weekend. This is how I heard about

1110
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,200
the song.

1111
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,280
Daddy

1112
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,359
shark. Daddy

1113
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,440
shark. Daddy

1114
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:26,000
shark. Daddy

1115
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,079
shark. Daddy shark. So you can see Fo

1116
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,599
dances to our own drummer. John's very

1117
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,280
organized though. And all kids are

1118
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,760
different. It's sort of cool. But as a

1119
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,960
result of this Baby Shark Mania, many of

1120
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,440
you can't get that song out of your

1121
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,720
head, can you? And tell you what, it's

1122
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,680
going to be stuck there the rest of the

1123
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,000
day. So, that got me thinking about the

1124
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,839
science of Baby Shark and what it might

1125
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,520
be doing to your brain. So, I thought

1126
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,800
I'd help you with this. When a song gets

1127
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,760
stuck in your head, that's all happened.

1128
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,599
Right. Right. It's called an earworm.

1129
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,520
Fast songs with simple remedies like

1130
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,880
Baby Shark are the biggest offenders.

1131
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,440
But here's a question. What's the best

1132
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,560
way to get rid of it? It's to lean in

1133
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,480
and let it run its course. So, I have a

1134
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,400
big announcement today. There have been

1135
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,800

1137
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,599
