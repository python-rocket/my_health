[Music]

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,040
I was told it's a little surprise in my

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,400
dressing room. But my goodness, it says

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,880
I'm smart, strong, brave, even fun with

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,400
a smiley face. It's pretty cool. But

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,639
who's responsible for this? And where

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,160
did it all come from? Got a feeling it's

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,760
from one of my guests today. So, I need

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,000
to do a little investigating. And I

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,630
can't wait for all of us to find out who

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,920
it is. Who did that?

12
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:28,160
[Applause]

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
Well, good news. I found out after a

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,559
long investigation who my mystery mirror

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,280
messenger is, she's the ultimate

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,040
survivor. From dominating daytime TV to

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,280
coping with serious health battles in

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,120
her daily life, Elizabeth Hasselbach is

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,840
here today

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,000
with a brand new view on what matters

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,320
most. And she's revealing how her faith

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,480
guided her into her new most important

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,480
role. Please welcome my friend Elizabeth

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,480
Hasselbeck.

25
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:04,239
[Applause]

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:08,159
Hi. You are brave and strong.

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,159
You're creative and fun and wise and

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,680
joyful. What else could I put on that

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,360
mirror? Brave. You put brave there.

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
Don't forget that. Brave. You are brave.

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,799
Oh, I'm kidding about that. You're brave

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,720
to sit with me. Well, you're kind of you

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
kind to come visit with it. Uh, thank

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,520
you for decorating the mirror. I'm

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,280
curious where the idea came from. You

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,119
know what? I think that and maybe it's

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,240
true for men, too. And I it must be

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,680
right because we're all human and

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,439
imperfect and we have those weak

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,880
moments. But I kind of I started doing

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,640
it for my kids and realized that I

42
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,439
needed it because I think the moment you

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,159
step away and even step into that mirror

44
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,520
like lies can sneak in. And I think

45
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,640
there's an enemy that wants you to

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,600
believe that you're not strong, that

47
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
you're not brave, that you're not

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,280
creative, and that those are lies. So I

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,520
really think that seeing yourself with

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,439
those words at the same time at the same

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,280
time every day um is just a

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,720
reinforcement of the truth. Where do you

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000
get your daily strength, your your

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,680
motivation? You've always been such an

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,360
upbeat person. Well, I mean, I have to

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,600
credit my mom and dad for just raising

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,399
us to be like good, hardworking, um,

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,240
optimistic. Can I show them off? You

59
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
can. Mom and dad are here. They're here.

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,280
They're actually They dragged them into

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,879
the studio. There they are.

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Congratulations. I know how hard it is

63
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,800
to raise an an adult child. Well, here's

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,360
what they did. I I love that they they

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,760
raised thinkers, um, hard workers, and

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,080
compassionate people, and I'm so

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,480
thankful for that. So I I adore how

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
people who are resilient can share with

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,000
the rest of America some of their little

70
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
tips and tricks and some a lot of it has

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
to do with faith but sometimes for

72
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,840
example with your ciliac ailment. So

73
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
when you were suffering through that how

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,280
did your faith play a role then how did

75
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,800
you actually you know surmount it? Well,

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,959
I thank you too because at the time that

77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
I was writing about being Gf free and

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,360
gluten-free, there wasn't really like

79
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,760
ton of like movement with that and you

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,480
really I think encouraged me in that

81
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,560
movement to kind of take the lead. And

82
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,000
um you know, I love being a celiac. I'm

83
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,000
thankful for that because I think what

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,239
it's done is allowed me to kind of like

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,480
forge new territory and find food that

86
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
in fact is anti-inflammatory. So whether

87
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,360
you're a celiac or you're gluten-free

88
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,280
and you're that other percentage, I

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,440
think years ago was a 13%, it's probably

90
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,159
greater now. Um, I I think it's great.

91
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm a cheerful celiac.

92
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,080
A cheerful celiac. I love that though

93
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,920
with the friendships that that you've

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,040
created in your life and I I'm blessed

95
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,599
to be one of your friends. So, I see

96
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,879
that close up. It reflected nicely in

97
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,360
this beautiful book. You mentioned point

98
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,000
of view, but uh point of view is is a is

99
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,239
a testimony to who you have become. And

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
I must say when when you left Fox and

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,879
Friends several years ago, I was very

102
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
worried about you. I didn't know what

103
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,040
had happened. I I I I didn't You reached

104
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,720
out to me, too. And I thank you for that

105
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
because I I could sense your your

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,480
concern and I I really needed to I think

107
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,920
as a person who works hard through

108
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,280
challenge and I talk there's some

109
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,360
stories in there about pushing through

110
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,159
things to a point. Um I think that maybe

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,159
I think I lacked rest and not just

112
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,760
sleep. So sleep I was really deprived of

113
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,200
sleep. I was probably for the first year

114
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,480
sleeping about three hours a night. Oh

115
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,480
my goodness. Because I wouldn't give up

116
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,599
on the day. Um I just knew I was hitting

117
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,519
the wall every day hard. And um I got to

118
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,159
a point where things and really I think

119
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,760
God allowed knowing how hard I would

120
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,599
work and how much I'd push through a

121
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,200
situation that for me I was mismanaging

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,120
the clock, not getting full rest and not

123
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,040
surrendering to the fact that if he has

124
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,040
you where he's called you to be, he will

125
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,320
enable you to do it. I was so worried

126
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,440
that I wouldn't get it right, that I

127
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,799
would get something wrong for my team,

128
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,960
that I wouldn't know enough information

129
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,680
about Syria or um a plane or I would I

130
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,360
wouldn't trust my capabilities. But I in

131
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
trusting your own capabilities again

132
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,720
there's a limit. I needed to trust his.

133
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,400
And so I wish I had figured that out

134
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,240
before I burned out, but I burned out

135
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,880
first. But God was kind because he let

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,479
that happen to lead me where ultimately

137
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,479
I think he knew I desired to be. It just

138
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
was the wrong season for me. I wish I

139
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,639
was at that position 10 years before my

140
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,919
kids were little. So it's not lost on me

141
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,479
you titled the book point of view

142
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,240
because the view is where most of us

143
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,639
came to know you well. And how did that

144
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,560
experience change you in ways that maybe

145
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,520
we didn't perceive from the outside?

146
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
That's why I've always been curious

147
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,440
about because I I've been on the show

148
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,520
enough times that I see how much

149
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,960
dialogue goes on. People are purposely

150
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,960
put on the panel because you're not

151
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,240
supposed to see eye to eye. Yeah. And I

152
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,759
think sometimes like it's a great thing.

153
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm a champion of women who have passion

154
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,600
and opinion about topics and I think

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,440
gathering there each and every day and

156
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,919
everyone from Whoopi to Candace Cameron

157
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,360
to Barbara Walters and Joy Behar um and

158
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,720
the women that are on there now know

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,880
that you have to come back again and do

160
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
it the next day. So I don't think you

161
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,759
can I think categorizing it as some sort

162
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,320
of punching match or a cat fight

163
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,720
undermines the value of women having

164
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,400
thoughtful conversations about the tough

165
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
toughest topics and then doing it again

166
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,720
the next day and every day. Um, so I'm

167
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,600
I'm really thankful for that time and my

168
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,440
lens on it is gratitude. I'm thankful to

169
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,759
have learned under Barbara Walters for a

170
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,440
decade. Um, so I'm so thankful for her

171
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,680
leadership. Was she hard on me?

172
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,759
Absolutely. Because like a good coach,

173
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
she was refining me and I just watched

174
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
her for 10 years. I mean, I loved what I

175
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,479
studied about her and how she was such a

176
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
good listener. And when I needed a

177
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,400
doctor, a great one, she made the call.

178
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,880
When I was fired and needed another job,

179
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,120
she made the call. Oh, she did. Yes, she

180
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,840
did. She was the one I turned to to say,

181
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,800
"Hey, I'm in trouble now." And before I

182
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,840
could even breathe out another sob, she

183
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,400
was writing Roger's at Fox for me. So

184
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,240
there was I would not be where I am

185
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,680
today without her. So in the toughest of

186
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,919
moments, I turned to Barbara. And I

187
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,360
would also say Whoopi Goldberg and I in

188
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,520
terms of having a point of view, we

189
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,440
haven't always agreed on topics. And I

190
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,600
tell you in this book, we don't see the

191
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,360
same, but we love the same. So in the

192
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,120
book you talk a little bit about being

193
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
approached that fateful day that you

194
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,560
alluded to earlier when you were fired

195
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,960
from the view which I don't know if you

196
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,039
expected it at all the country was

197
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,120
shocked. I had no inkling this was even

198
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,680
happening. Two executives knock on the

199
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,240
doors. What happened? They walked in.

200
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,479
They walked in and you know they listen

201
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,400
fired is clear terms for we're not

202
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,000
renewing your contract when it expires

203
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,759
and it's like advanced notice on losing

204
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
your job. You're like I would have just

205
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,080
liked to know at the last day. Right.

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,639
Um, that was hard for me. It was hard

207
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,759
because I'm a loyal person. Uh, because

208
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,919
I had I really felt a duty and calling

209
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,759
in my job at the view. I think I must

210
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,759
have been hanging on a little too tight

211
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,800
to it. You know, if something has the

212
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:22,720
power to knock you down that hard, then

213
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,479
it must be a little bit of um an idol

214
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,880
and have a grip on you that it doesn't

215
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,800
deserve. You know, I really felt like

216
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,479
knocked down by it. And I literally kept

217
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
asking, "What can I do? What can I do

218
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,160
differently? Do you need me to do you

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
want me to cut my hair? Do you want I

220
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
described the moment it was it felt like

221
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,560
a mini suffering because I was losing

222
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,120
something that I was clinging to and I

223
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,599
was clinging to maybe the identity that

224
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,360
I needed to be there. And so that was a

225
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,360
hard transition for me, but I'm thankful

226
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,360
for that too. I'd get fired again if it

227
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,199
brought me everything after it. So So

228
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,960
what it's a beautiful way of looking at

229
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,000
it, but for someone right now sitting at

230
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,120
home who's suffering with the fact that

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,240
they don't have a job or they've lost

232
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,199
their job or they don't feel they're

233
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,240
valued by the people they're around,

234
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,520
what's the advice you give them? I think

235
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,280
you just nailed it. I think you don't

236
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,840
feel your value and it's just a matter

237
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,680
of not placing your value in the things

238
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,199
and even the things that bring you joy.

239
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,360
You just can't. Yeah. You got to write

240
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,639
your own story. Up next, if you'll stick

241
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
with us, I will. Liz is going to help

242
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,000
some of the audience revealing her

243
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,680
ultimate survival skills for overcoming

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,840
change when you least expect it. You

245
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,120
won't want to miss it.

246
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,319
We are back with the wonderful Elizabeth

247
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,240
Hasselblack. You know, she's going to

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,560
share a survival skill that can help

249
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,440
anyone face change in their own life.

250
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,120
It's to do some forgiveness math. we

251
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,120
need to forgive more. You got a little

252
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,640
mathematical equation mathematical. I'm

253
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,240
very proud of you for constructing.

254
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,120
Well, listen, I think it's it's pretty

255
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,039
common sense. And I think um I used to

256
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,839
think that there had to be a wrong plus

257
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,120
an apology to equal forgiveness, right?

258
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,240
That seems like the normal way of

259
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,800
thinking about it. Like, I'm going to

260
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,560
wait for you to say you're sorry and

261
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,480
then I'll forgive you. Yeah. But I what

262
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,800
I realized was that that doesn't lead to

263
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,200
a freedom in your heart and you just

264
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,480
kind of carry that around waiting. And I

265
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,680
don't think that God wants us to wait

266
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
around for forgiveness because he

267
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,760
certainly didn't exemplify that um with

268
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,800
us. So he forgave us first. And I'm

269
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,680
thinking, well, how can we do that?

270
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,880
Okay, so forgiveness comes first. Like I

271
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,360
forgive you before even you might feel

272
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,720
sorry. And then my heart's free. And

273
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,399
then you don't know the gift that you're

274
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,440
giving to someone else who might feel so

275
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,519
shameful or bad about how maybe they did

276
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,399
a wrong to you. Maybe you unlock their

277
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,040
heart too. But I will say I learned that

278
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,680
I didn't find freedom until I first

279
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,279
forgave. Um and the beauty of

280
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,600
acknowledging that we've been forgiven

281
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,600
as real.

282
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,320
I actually just to play on that a little

283
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,760
bit. I I think it's also very empowering

284
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,959
for the person who made the mistake. In

285
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,480
fact, I'm going to speak about something

286
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,160
that I care a lot about. Rosie

287
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,760
O'Donnell. She's been on the show. Yeah.

288
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
I know she's controversial, but I I I

289
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,600
really appreciate what she tries to do.

290
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,959
Her

291
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,120
apology to you, I think, came in part

292
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,680
because she felt that energy. I suspect.

293
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,839
I haven't talked to her.

294
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,560
How do you make sense of that? You know,

295
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,519
I think, listen, I think God does more

296
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,120
than we could ever imagine. And he knows

297
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,040
your friend's heart. He knows your

298
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
heart. And I think he wants us in

299
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,399
relationship with one another. He

300
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
doesn't want us holding our ground. He

301
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,600
wants us holding hands. And so I think

302
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,399
what happens when you just go first

303
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,240
like there is a domino effect in heart.

304
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,760
Be the person to go first. Go first in

305
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,760
your relationships. Go first in your

306
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,920
friendships. Go first in apology. And

307
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,200
just watch, you know, just watch. Go

308
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,480
first in your marriage. You know,

309
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,360
sometimes I wait for Tim. I'm like,

310
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
"Let's see if he like tells me I'm cute.

311
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,839
Let's just see." And I'm waiting. I'm

312
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,440
like, "What am I waiting for? Am I

313
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,440
scripting for failure?" That's right.

314
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,200
And so if you go first and you speak the

315
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,040
love language first, I promise you this.

316
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,279
God blesses that. You're going to have a

317
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,200
joy in it. We're meant to give stuff

318
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,720
away, give our hearts away. And so I

319
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,519
think when you do that, the beauty is

320
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,720
that um it it does end up creating this

321
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,720
sort of momentum of heart and I like

322
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,040
that. Like I'm I'm going to go first.

323
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,600
Yeah. Well, I think I think all of us

324
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,040
really appreciated how you handled all

325
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,240
the issues with Rosie, but all the other

326
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,800
things in your life as well. You're a

327
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,720
classy woman. You go first. You send a

328
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,320
very clear message that people matter. I

329
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,760
think the way you even describe the

330
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,360
relationships that matter the most to

331
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,959
you. The fact that you can disagree, but

332
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,240
it's the love that'll bind us. It's

333
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,279
ultimately the biggest message we all

334
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
have to hear. And I'm glad that's all

335
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,279
God. That's all God because without that

336
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm kind of cranky.

337
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,000
Elizabeth has back. God bless you. You

338
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,920
can hear more about her brand new book,

339
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,519
Point of View. It's a fresh look at

340
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,720
work, faith, and freedom by picking up

341
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,560
the book and reading it because it's

342
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,839
very well done. Lots more her in the

343
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,839
book. Thank you for watching.
