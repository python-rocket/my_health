1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,160
Warning signs that can go unnoticed. I

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,480
was undiagnosed for 22 years. Symptoms

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,360
that can mimic other illnesses. Had

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,280
severe neck pain in the back of my neck.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,440
How do you know if you are at risk for

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,039
thyroid cancer? It sneaks up on you,

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,760
which is one of the reasons we miss it.

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,600
Plus, Shark Tanks Damon John reveals his

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,039
own battle with the disease. The fact

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,039
that to save one life, isn't that what

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,080
I've been given this public stage for?

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,840
Coming up next.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,520
[Music]

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,520
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

15
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,320
[Music]

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,460
I love you back.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,460
[Music]

18
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,340
[Applause]

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,280
If you're feeling tired, you have

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,680
trouble losing weight, or you spot hair

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,199
in the drain like looks like this in the

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,600
shower, right? That could be an issue

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,479
with your thyroid. But is it a sluggish

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,400
thyroid or could it be thyroid cancer?

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,400
It's an important question since thyroid

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,159
cancer rates have tripled over the last

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
three decades and three out of four

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,200
cases are found in women. So today, we

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,439
are arming you with the red flags to

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,439
look for so you can tell the difference.

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,600
Joining us now, a man who turned his

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,439
survival story into a mission to save

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,050
lives. Please welcome my dear friend,

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:35,479
the shark with the biggest bite. Damon

35
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:40,240
[Applause]

36
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,240
John, my man, my

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,119
favorite having you here. How you doing?

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,479
Well, before we get too far into this,

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,680
you obviously David's going to talk a

40
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,439
little bit about his thyroid cancer,

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,240
stage two thyroid cancer. How you

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,280
feeling now? I am feeling great. I am uh

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,840
um cancer free. I'm in remission. Yeah.

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
Um I but but you know, it's a process. I

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,640
I still have to check on it and I still

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,840
have to stay on top of it and make sure

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,439
that it doesn't come back. I've been in

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,680
one year in remission, but you know,

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,759
it's a it's a I got to keep educating

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,119
myself on how to improve. Do you ever

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,879
wake up in the middle of the night,

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,200
stare at the ceiling, and think, "What

53
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,080
if I hadn't figured it out? What if it

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,160
wasn't caught in time? Yeah, I have. I

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
have thought about that. I I I you know,

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,040
at one point we felt that it may have

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,480
been moving up to my lymph nodes. Um and

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,319
I think about all the work that I've

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,440
done all my life. You know, as an

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,200
entrepreneur, I never took care of

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,120
myself, right? We took care of everybody

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,440
else, right? Family and the employees

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,519
and everything else. And why didn't I

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,160
take care of myself? Uh I just didn't

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,000
know that you could be ahead of the game

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,920
and try to get early detection. I always

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
thought let me stick my head in the sand

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,319
and hopefully that invisible bust

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,319
doesn't hit me like it has hit such

70
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,360
people like our dear friend uh big an

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,599
yes big an good example. Yeah. So so you

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,200
just using investment technology because

73
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,720
you know you're a businessman. Yeah. You

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,720
argue that the biggest investment we

75
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,959
need to make is to invest in ourselves

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,360
in our health. Absolutely. Yeah. You

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,360
know first of all from uh you know from

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,280
one standpoint if you're healthy then

79
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,840
you can be more productive. All right.

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,280
And then you know uh mentally also think

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,360
about that you know the the old saying

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,879
is a person with their health has a

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,959
thousand dreams a person without only

84
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,959
has one. And when you see us on Shark

85
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,480
Tank we don't talk about health. We

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,480
don't talk about uh you know we'll go

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
out and learn everything how to increase

88
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,200
sales and reduce cost and what's new

89
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,200
technology but we won't say something

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,040
doesn't feel right. How do I check into

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,560
it? And maybe a doctor or somebody is

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,560
not you know one point they can't

93
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
diagnose it immediately. We go oh that's

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
okay. I don't say that in my business.

95
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,239
You tell me it can't work, I don't go,

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,080
that's okay. So why don't we do the same

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,360
thing with our health? You know, I I

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,360
never heard actually that a person with

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,640
their health has a thousand dreams and a

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,159
person without their health only has

101
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,680
one. Yeah. I think that's true for any

102
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,040
of us who've been ill, right? The day

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,720
you get sick, you got one thing that you

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,840
got to aim for. Everything else falls

105
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,799
away. Absolutely. And that's what we're

106
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
doing today. We're going to help you all

107
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,040
invest in your health because I got the

108
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,720
best investor out there to make it

109
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,000
happen because knowing what to look for

110
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,599
can make all the difference. So I want

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,519
you to meet two more thyroid cancer

112
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,239
survivors. Come on over here. Everyone

113
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,120
is in remission. Dope. Congratulations.

114
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,439
I'll high five on that. Congratulations.

115
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,040
How you doing? Could you start with you?

116
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,720
By the way, I can't help notice. Is this

117
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,160
Is that a tattoo? It's real. Yes, it is.

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
It's a beautiful butterfly. It's a

119
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,280
beautiful butter. Why a butterfly? Well,

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,160
having a hidden c cancer for so many

121
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,800
years. Um, it represents the shape of

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
the thyroid gland. And so, we butterfly

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,360
warriors have the thyroid ribbon color

124
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,759
of aqua, pink, and purple. And I

125
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,840
designed it after a Peruvian butterfly.

126
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,080
And it flattened the koid while covering

127
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,360
the scar. Yes. So there's multiple

128
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,800
benefits. That's correct. Plus

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,800
emblematic of your survival. That's

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,560
true. Now Nicole here is a big time

131
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,919
Shark Tank fan. All right. So I know

132
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,240
that you got a little message here for

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,919
Damon as well. Oh, I do. I'm glad to

134
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,759
meet well both of you in person but um I

135
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:59,280
appreciate that you are open about not

136
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,479
only you know before you were diagnosed

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,479
um not maybe putting your health as a

138
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,560
priority. It's great that you're

139
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,199
bringing awareness to you know that this

140
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,880
is sort of a lifelong thing once we have

141
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,880
you know once we're in remission we're

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,160
still monitoring ourselves and it's sort

143
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,840
of the dayto-day um battle to thrive you

144
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,520
know. Come on, give me a hug.

145
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,960
Feel good to hear that? It does. It

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,160
does. You know, because I didn't know if

147
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
I wanted to go public with it, but I

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
figured if I could just save one life,

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,440
you know, isn't that what I'm what what

150
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,360
I've been given this public stage for?

151
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,440
So, of course, you got a big voice for

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
us. Yeah. Coming over here. Well, most

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,199
people with thyroid cancer don't have

154
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,320
symptoms. If they do have symptoms,

155
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,759
there are four essential red flags,

156
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,960
right? And each of these flags is

157
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,400
important for you to keep in mind. So,

158
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,759
I've got three survivors who walk us

159
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,919
through it. They've been start us off.

160
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,280
The first red flag for folks to pay

161
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,039
attention to is trouble breathing. Did

162
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,720
you have that problem at all? I did not

163
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,440
actually have that problem of trouble

164
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,160
breathing. I really didn't. Uh and I

165
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,479
didn't feel many many of the the the the

166
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,560
symptoms until after I said, "Wait a

167
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,680
minute, maybe there was an issue and I

168
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,120
didn't notice it." Now that you

169
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,240
mentioned it, that's the point right

170
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,440
now. We're going to actually mention it

171
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,199
so you think about it before it happen.

172
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
And and none of these are all that

173
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,639
common because most people with thyroid

174
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,919
cancer don't have any symptoms, but

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,520
these are the ones that do sort of wake

176
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,960
you up to them. Okay, Janet, go ahead.

177
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,919
You get the next red flag. And I'm

178
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,560
wondering if you had any of these

179
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,360
problems, constant cough being yours.

180
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,039
Horse and constant smoker's cough every

181
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,479
night for more than two years and never

182
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,240
touched a cigarette. Whoa. So constant

183
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,720
cough number three. Take it away,

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,680
Nicole. The third red flag is all about

185
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,880
neck pain and what kind of pain it is.

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,360
or the ejection. Did you have any pain

187
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,759
at all? I did. I did not realize it had

188
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,400
to do with my thyroid, but I had severe

189
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,120
neck pain in the back of my neck. I

190
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,800
couldn't sleep. Um, you know, and I

191
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,720
thought, "Oh, boy, I need a massage."

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,560
But after my surgery, it resolved. So,

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,000
yeah, it's chameleon, you know, it

194
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
sneaks up on you, which is one of the

195
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,520
reasons we miss it. And the fourth red

196
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,759
flag is trouble swallowing which happens

197
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,440
because as the as the thyroid starts to

198
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,880
get in the way of other basic functions

199
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
right on top of the throat you'll have

200
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,280
issues with breathing. You'll have

201
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,800
issues with swallowing sometimes because

202
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,880
it begins to invade in the tissues

203
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,240
around it or just because it gets bigger

204
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,080
and you can get that even if you have a

205
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,280
a goer which is an evident cancer. So

206
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
there that this is in a critical

207
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,800
location in your body. So it's trying to

208
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,800
whisper to you that it's there. When we

209
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
come back the at home thyroid test that

210
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,800
we're going to be calling the Damon John

211
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,479
neck check. All right. Like that idea,

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,160
the Monica. Absolutely. I love it. All

213
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,960
right. You can do it right now in your

214
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,280
own home. We're going to show you

215
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,170
exactly how. So stick around.

216
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:42,160
[Applause]

217
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:44,840
[Music]

218
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,280
He's accused of a lot of questionable

219
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,240
behavior. He asked me to undress me. He

220
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,199
watched me while I did so. He was very

221
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,440
creepy and unprofessional. He conducted

222
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,360
the exam without any gloves. It was very

223
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,000
uncomfortable. I didn't understand. The

224
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,720
university gynecologist accused by over

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,759
300 women of the most unspeakable

226
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,560
crimes. These young women were violated.

227
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,560
All new Oz. That's coming up

228
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,800
[Music]

229
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,879
tomorrow. We are back with Shark Tank Mo

230
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,240
Damon John who survived thyroid cancer

231
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,479
is on a mission to save lives. Now,

232
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,639
we're about to show you a super easy

233
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,160
atome thyroid test you can do right now.

234
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
But first, take a quick look at the

235
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,280
thyroid and what it does. So, your

236
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,199
thyroid is this itty bitty

237
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,800
butterflyshaped gland. It's hidden

238
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,719
beneath the Adam's apple, which is out

239
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,959
there, right under here. And it affects

240
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,159
your body in a really big way. Most

241
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,519
people know that it regulates your

242
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,880
body's metabolism, but it can affect

243
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,240
your heart rate. It can affect how your

244
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,720
lungs squeeze, even your body

245
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
temperature. So, a lot of things begin

246
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,440
to get affected. If your thyroid is

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,880
making too much of a hormone, all these

248
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
hormones going up, then guess what? The

249
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,240
heart goes faster, lungs go faster, your

250
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,640
temperature goes high. that makes too

251
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,600
little of a hormone that's called

252
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,440
hypothyroidism. A lot of you have that,

253
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
right? That can signify an autoimmune

254
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,279
problem that can increase your risk of

255
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,040
thyroid cancer as well as making you

256
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,800
feel sluggish and, you know, slowing

257
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,519
everything down too much. Now, the good

258
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,519
news is is when this thyroid gets large,

259
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,600
you know, most of the time it's not a

260
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,680
big deal, right? Only a small percentage

261
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,440
of people end up getting cancer. So,

262
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,200
I've got a little test to figure out if

263
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,320
your thyroid is healthy or if it's

264
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,360
enlarged. You need to go out and get

265
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,120
someone to look at it. We're gonna call

266
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,680
it the Damon John neck check. All right,

267
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,040
you audience, you all do this? Okay, put

268
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,600
your hands together like a butterfly.

269
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,160
Like you're gonna swim or fly like that.

270
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,839
Okay, you all ready to do this? Okay,

271
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,760
now we're all going to do it together.

272
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,920
We're we're floating like a butterfly.

273
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,720
Put that on top of your Adam's apple.

274
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,880
Got the Adam's apple, right? Okay, now

275
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,080
those fingers that were just dancing,

276
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,000
push that a little bit. You feel the

277
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,920
little ribs there, the little notches?

278
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,279
That's the trachea. Okay. Now, al

279
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,640
together you're going to

280
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,920
swallow. As you swallow, if you need a

281
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,279
little water, you can drink, get a glass

282
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,040
of water and get the water in your

283
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,040
mouth, then swallow. Then, if you feel

284
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,279
something jump up and down, like a piece

285
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,440
of tissue, like a small finger jumping

286
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,519
up and down beneath your fingers, right?

287
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,959
That means you've got a thyroid that's

288
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,240
bigger than it's supposed to be. If it

289
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,080
feels lumpy, if it's sore, don't panic.

290
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,399
You go see a doctor. All right? So,

291
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,399
everyone

292
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,800
swallow, right? What are you feeling now

293
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,120
that you're doing it right?

294
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,240
It's okay. No problems. Nothing. You

295
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,680
feel anything? No, I don't feel

296
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
anything. Good. You're not supposed to

297
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,440
feel anything. Oh, that's a good thing.

298
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,480
If you don't feel anything, of course,

299
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,079
the coughing is allowed also, right?

300
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,279
You're pretty good. Did you Did you feel

301
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
something when you were having the

302
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,959
thyroid when I did? Yeah. When I went

303
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
into the and the surgeon told me to feel

304
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,360
there, I did. Yeah. And you notice, by

305
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,120
the way, he's got his fingers under his

306
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,399
tie. It's sort of low. It's not up here.

307
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,680
Don't feel under your chin, right?

308
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,120
You're not trying to That's the Napoleon

309
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,880

down low. So, listen, not all lumps and

312
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,120
cancer, but it's always worth a trip to

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,920

Are you guys ready? They're ready to go.

345
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,480
All right. What do you look for when you

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,959
get pitched an idea? Uh, you know, can

347
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,320
it solve a a problem? Uh, and of course,

348
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,000
I look for the entrepreneur. Do they

349
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,279
really have a passion behind it? And are

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,800

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
nurses who have briefly pitched their

354
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,079
product. And Damon's going to pick his

355
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,839
favorite. Up first in the tank is

356
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:27,760
Sarah. There she is, Sarah. Come on out.

357
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,320

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,399
Delaware, actually. And she has a

359
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,279
solution to a big problem. Damon, take

360
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,839
it away. Hello, Dr. Oz Damon. My name is

361
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,720
Sarah and I developed the Qualclipip

362
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,880
stethoscope holder because I find

363
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,399
wearing my stethoscope on my neck very

364
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,200
uncomfortable. It was giving me

365
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,880
headaches and neck pain at the end of my

366
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,519
shift. I didn't like the way it swung

367
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,800
into my patients when I leaned over to

368
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,880
provide care to them. And also for nurse

369
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,360
safety to prevent an agitated patient

370
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,000
from gaining control by using the

371
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,079
stethoscope as a strangulation device.

372
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,639
Never thought of that. Happens all the

373
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,240
time. Oh my goodness. Very very scary.

374
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,639
Never thought of that angle. All right.

375
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,920
So what's the solution? So instead of

376
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,560
wearing my stethoscope around my neck,

377
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,160
I wear my stethoscope in my koala clip.

378
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,160
Koala clip. Koala clip because it

379
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,279
reminds me of a koala. The way a koala

380
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,200
grabs onto a tree. Yes. Well, you put it

381
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,880
like that. Oh, yes. So, it's al it's

382
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,399
spring, so you can really wear it

383
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,639
anywhere that you'd like. Um, I like it

384
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,519
on my pocket. A lot of my customers like

385
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,120
the like it on their waistband. You can

386
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,120
at the end of your shift, you can put it

387
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,120
on your tote bag on the outside so you

388
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,040
don't have to put your um stethoscope

389
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,880
and curl it up and put it in your bag.

390
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,920
Uses a hair clip, all kinds of very

391
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,680
cool. Sure. Sure. And and there's

392
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,519
nothing there's nothing out there that

393
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,440
uh you know previously to to hold

394
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,240
stethoscopes. Well, there is something

395
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,160
out there um to hold stethoscopes. It's

396
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,800
a different design than mine. I have a

397
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,720
design patent. All right. And uh it

398
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,600
didn't work and that's why I developed

399
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,839
this product because I had really bad

400
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,480
neck pain. Thank you very very much. Do

401
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,600
you have any specific advice for Sarah?

402
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,600
uh you know honestly this is a very uh

403
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
simple product that is needed in the

404
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,160
market and this is not one of those

405
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,399
things where you need a big deal. You

406
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,920
can start off by making a dozen or a

407
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,440
hundred and or you know whatever the

408
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,440
case is and it could actually grow into

409
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,199
a very very big business. So

410
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,680
congratulations. Thank you. All right.

411
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,560
Now let's see who your competitor is.

412
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,920
Amy is here. Come on out Amy. Let's see

413
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,760
what she Oh my goodness. She's bringing

414
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
a patient with her. A patient and a

415
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,480
nurse and an orderly.

416
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:47,440
This looks uh a serious deal here.

417
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,120
All right, Amy, briefly, what is the

418
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,639
product? Yes, my name is Amy

419
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,320
Copperweight. I am the CEO of Avkin. I'm

420
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
also a clinical nurse specialist and

421
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,160
faculty at the University of Delaware.

422
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,920
What we've really done is taken these

423
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,240
large plastic mannequins that students

424
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,639
are normally taught on and rettaught on

425
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,560
and taken that lifeless form and

426
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,000
actually taken the technology into bits

427
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,920
and pieces so that they actually could

428
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,079
be used on a live person. So they can

429
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,839
really develop not just the competence

430
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,480
but also the compassion that's needed in

431
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,720
healthcare today. So is it is it the

432
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,800
chest piece? What is the actual device?

433
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
So yes, the the actual device Damon

434
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,519
actually has one right over here. If you

435
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,920
take a look, this is the first of three

436
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
of our patented products. Um it actually

437
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,199
has lung sounds and you can instill

438
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
mucus into it because we know patients

439
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,320
with tracheiotomies often have a lot of

440
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,000
mucus. So it's just that realism, that

441
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,079
authenticity, but you actually have a

442
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,519
real person there. So you're interacting

443
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,199
with a real person as they're learning

444
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,040
the care.

445
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,320
So you actually suction it in. Yeah.

446
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,440
Come on up. Come on up. We're going to

447
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,600
do this together. Oh my goodness. Inside

448
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,720
here, you go. That's uh that's beyond my

449
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,360
pay grade, man. I want to see how you

450
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,040
do. You can see it on this side. Um so

451
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,800
essentially this thing is is it's a

452
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,399
piece of technology, wearable technology

453
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,320
that actually has sensors inside. So if

454
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,959
I suction too deeply and hit her corina

455
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,399
or the where her lungs bifurcate, she

456
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,839
actually will get a vibration and know

457
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,440
how to react and respond the way a real

458
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,079
patient would. So, it's really giving

459
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,320
that authenticity to real true bedside

460
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,680
care. So, Dr. Oz, you have a pair of

461
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,839
gloves over here. We're going to do this

462
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,079
non-sterily even though it's for TV.

463
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,600
Just for time. Go ahead. Go ahead. Put

464
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,519
some gloves on. I'm going to turn the

465
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,880
suction

466
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,040
on. Megan, take a couple deep breaths

467
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,600
for me. Do you feel like you're having a

468
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,279
hard time breathing? Okay. So, I'm going

469
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,880
to be a bad nurse and I'm going to go

470
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,720
down and hit her corina, but we'll see

471
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,720
if Dr. Oz can do a better job after I'm

472
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
done. So, I'm going to go down. Well,

473
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,440
that wasn't done right. No, that's not

474
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,959
good. All right. Sorry. Okay. So, I'm

475
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
simulating what the nursing students

476
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,160
would have done. Taken too long, been

477
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,920
uncomfortable. And now we're going to

478
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,199
see if Dr. Oz can do a better job here.

479
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm I don't I'm not usually better than

480
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,839
a nurse at this, but we'll give it a

481
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,279
shot. Yeah. Well, maybe if you don't go

482
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:57,480
down quite so far. We go.

483
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,480
Go ahead and do the suction on the

484
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,160
All right, that's enough

485
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,759
time. That is realistic. Yeah, it's

486
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,120
really meant to create that authenticity

487
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,400
and realism. And then at the end of the

488
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,760
simulation experience or the learning

489
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,439
experience, they actually get to hear

490
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,799
from the patients perspective how that

491
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,400
was. Here, turn, turn that off so I can

492
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,640
hear you better. Sure. Damon, advice,

493
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,360
brain, what what do you think? I have no

494
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,439
idea what just happened. Um, and I'm

495
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,240
just I'm just so thankful for medical

496
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,760
professionals because I I'm I'm just so

497
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,199
thankful for medical professionals. I I

498
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,280
I have no idea what just happened.

499
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,720
David, don't you want competent and

500
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,320
compassionate health? No, absolutely.

501
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
And thank God you can think of this and

502
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,480
keep improving science to make us

503
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,160
healthier. I I make t-shirts. So, all

504
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,360
right. You tell us who is the winner.

505
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,360
Now, you got two wonderful nurse

506
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,360
entrepreneurs. The winner is

507
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,360
Oh, they're both saving lives. Both. I

508
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,440
can't do it, Doc. I can't do it. All

509
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,679
right. Both. Both. Two winners. All

510
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,160
right. We have two coveted winners.

511
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,160
There we have it.

512
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,160
I didn't want that on you.

513
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,679
How many put it on wrong? Two winners.

514
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,200
Congratulations. You both did a

515
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,640
wonderful job. You know what? Because

516
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,679
you're nurses and because you guys are

517
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,039
the ones who really make the healthare

518
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,240
system work. God bless you. Thank you

519
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,760
very, very much. Absolutely. All right.

520
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,559
Now, I got a special announcement with

521
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,320
Damon for a second. Before we go, you

522
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,400
teamed up with Johnson Johnson for the

523
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,160
lab coat of the future quickfire

524
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,760
challenge. It sounds cool. What is it?

525
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
You know, the lab coat has been the same

526
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,440
way for so many years. And you look at

527
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,760
technology today where we can probably

528
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,320
make uh some technology on it where if

529
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,880
you're having some products on it and uh

530
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,240
you know it's dangerous for the lab code

531
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
professional or the professional using

532
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,360
or people outside we can know more about

533
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,799
it. The lab code has been the exact

534
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,039
same. So Johnson and Johnson and I

[Applause]

577
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,799
Are we dancing?

578
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,799
I love having you here. I love having

579
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,760
you here, too.

580
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,600
So, I I got to say,

581
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,039
I you all love her as much as I do, but

582
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,760
I have a special affinity for you. And

583
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,840
one thing I know is I know it's the fall

584
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,480
because the racial ratio's 13th season.

585
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,480
It's back. Yeah.

586
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,200
Can still afford groceries. I got a job.

587
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,400
Yay. Well, that's one of the things that

588
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,159
makes you so special. Thank you. Thank

589
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
you. The fall, besides having to go back

590
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,120
and make the show, which is I know is a

591
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,080
joy for all of us. Fall is my favorite

592
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,200
season. Um, and soups are probably my

593
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,520
favorite type of of food. They they

594
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
really are very nourishing in in so many

595
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,799
ways, like for your soul, not just your

596
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,480
body, but And they're great cuz they can

597
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,080
take whatever you got in the summer.

598
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
That's right. And and you make it

599
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,679
because fall creeps up on you and

600
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,440
repurpose it. Yeah. late late summer,

601
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,600
early fall, I I do tons and tons of make

602
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,320
ahead meals, and they're all soups and

603
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,640
stews and sauces, translating the

604
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,159
vegetables into a freezer. This Yes.

605
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,760
This is what Rachel is really good at.

606
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,280
Now, this is this is really

607
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,320
smart. When you make your soups and

608
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,240
stews for the fall, don't put them into

609
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,480
those plastic storage containers. They

610
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,720
take up too much room. cool them down to

611
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,679
room temperature and put them in these

612
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,080
flat freezer bags and you can stack up

613
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,000
dozens of them in the freezer. And it's

614
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,159
a great way when broccoli's on sale,

615
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
make some broccoli soup. The last corn

616
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,919
of the season, make some corn soup or

617
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,080
corn chowder or corn and seafood soup.

618
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,360
It's as easy as a box of stock. If you

619
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,320
don't have time to make stock from

620
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,200
scratch and any vegetable combination,

621
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,520
throw it in the freezer, make your own

622
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,360
uh takeout food and frozen foods and

623
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,960
canned foods. It's so much cheaper and

624
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,559
better for you. Let's talk about soup in

625
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,760
general. I I've heard you say that if

626
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,000
you really want to make Italian food

627
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,799
healthy, Yes. make it into a soup. You

628
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,799
know, Italian food, uh, if you're not of

629
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,880
Italian descent, if your family isn't

630
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,520
Italian, some people think of Italian

631
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,520
American food that's very delicious but

632
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,760
super high in calories, like chicken

633
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,960
parm, you know, fried chicken with

634
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,919
cheese and lots of uh giant sides of

635
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,159
pasta with with tons and tons of cheese.

636
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,400
But if you're trying to trim down,

637
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,799
Italian food and soups are actually a

638
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
great way to do it. Lots of vegetable

639
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,200
laden soups are very filling and full of

640
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,679
great nutrition and you can have a

641
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,360
little bit of pasta in it or beans, but

642
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,039
you're not eating a ton of calories.

643
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,440
You're just getting a a ton of great

644
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,720
nutrition. So, you three examples of how

645
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,200
we take these healthy ingredients. Three

646
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,120
of my favorites. Two of my favorites.

647
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,720
And you're bringing him to life for us.

648
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,240
Everybody loves tomato soup, right?

649
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,960
Yes,

650
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,200
a lot of people enjoy a creamy tomato

651
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,840
soup. So, finishing with heavy cream.

652
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,960
This is an Italian traditional method of

653
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,720
making tomato soup. You take your root

654
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,799
vegetables. I like fennel, carrot,

655
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,000
celery, onion or your usual suspects. I

656
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:20,960
put garlic in everything. You add stock,

657
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,200
uh, San Marzano, canned tomatoes. And

658
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,679
you thicken the soup in a very clever

659
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,919
way. Not with heavy cream, but with a

660
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,480
little palenta, a little corn, a little

661
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,039
cornmeal in it. It makes it sweeter and

662
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,679
more delicious. And then I love these

663
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,159
little immersion blenders. It's so much

664
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,400
easier than taking the soup and trying

665
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,520
to throw it into a blender. Screaming

666
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,720
hot boiling soup. Don't do that. When do

667
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,039
you add the tomatoes? You can add them

668
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,159
here. It doesn't matter. You soften the

669
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,919
veggies just so they're going to go

670
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,080
through the blender a little easier. And

671
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,720
then you just break this down and let

672
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,159
the tomatoes cook out and you thicken it

673
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,760
with a little bit of palenta. Those are

674
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,520
done. If you want to try a little bit.

675
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh, you made it already. Oh, she's so

676
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,039
prepared. Those are some dundons.

677
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,679
It's truly delicious. It's slightly

678
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:11,440
sweet, but it's savory. Isn't that It's

679
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,840
full, isn't it? And this is such great

680
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,840
nutrition. And it's And what else is

681
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,000
great about soup is it stretches a

682
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,919
dollar. You know, it's the way you

683
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,520
stretch a book. Why do more people not

684
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,600
use palenta as a thickening age? Is it

685
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,960
brilliant? It's just it's an it's an

686
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,799
Italian thing. It's a cultural thing.

687
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,720
Like we just you know people in America

688
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,000
don't use cornmeal. If you come from the

689
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,919
south totally use cornmeal grits. Hello.

690
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,279
So there's probably a lot of great chefs

691
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,559
down south that would thicken up

692
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,960
anything with a little bit of cornmeal.

693
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,880
This is today's hero. Today's hero for

694
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,640
delicious and super sweet. It's our

695
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,240
hero. All right. Now this is a little

696
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,320
special. This is you know this is the

697
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,240
minestron with chicken riata meatball.

698
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,640
But can I say one thing? Yeah. People

699
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,440
don't eat escoral. This is esciral.

700
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,080
You'd say in Italian scroll. When you're

701
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,120
a kid, um the first meal you're

702
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,679
introduced to is a chini de pepe. Little

703
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,679
bits of pasta in broth with a bit of

704
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,240
greens. You know, most people know this

705
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,600
soup from like it's a derivative of

706
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,159
wedding soup. They call it little

707
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,840
meatball soup. But this one, I hope

708
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,440
everybody downloads this. It's so

709
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,039
delicious. If you want your kids to

710
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,600
embrace escodol or kale, put it in with

711
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,360
little baby meatballs and pasta and they

712
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,720
will love it. But I talk about kale all

713
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,279
the time and I've actually gotten a lot

714
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,880
of folks to eat it. But this isn't kale.

715
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,600
This is a green we never really talked

716
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,600
about. This is a great sturdy green that

717
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,880
you can cook with and it is a superfood

718
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,120
as they say. But scuttle or escarol is

719
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,279
milder once you cook it out. It's only

720
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,159
slightly bitter. You can eat it raw in

721
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,720
salads. This is again your usual

722
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,679
suspects. Carrot, celery, onion, garlic,

723
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,360
stock, vegetable or chicken. And you I

724
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,039
always drop in when I make soups. This

725
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,320
is a great tip. The rind of parmyo

726
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,080
reaniano. The whole soup tastes like

727
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,760
parm cheese. My wife does that. You get

728
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,679
so much flavor. It's it delicious. I

729
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,279
always buy a piece of cheese with the

730
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,000
rind on it and I keep them in my

731
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,000
freezer. It looks like um Remy the rat

732
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,919
tattooy rats in my house cuz I got so

733
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,080
many cheese rind in the freezer. little

734
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,000
fresh music, but it's so good in your

735
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,159
sauces, and your soups. Throw that

736
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,880
together. And you just wilt the greens

737
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,640
in here. And now this, you cook the

738
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,039
meatballs not in oil. So healthy. You

739
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,279
cook them like dumplings directly,

740
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,000
dropping the chicken and the ricotta

741
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,919
into the soup. So try it. Try it. This

742
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,679
is good. Okay. The beans you add when?

743
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,440
The bean. The beans and the pasta you

744
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,840
cook off at the same time as the baby

745
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,159
meatballs.

746
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,159
It's great nutrition and children love

747
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,159
these little meatballs. They're soft,

748
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,919
they're sweet, and it's just ground

749
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,039
white meat chicken and a little ricotta

750
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,559
cheese. And this all has the right

751
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,159
texture. It's got a nice and all the

752
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,960
bitterness is out of it. No, it's

753
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,240
delicious. Honestly, the kids will love

754
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,600
this. And you're giving them great

755
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,440
nutrition. And this is why people get

756
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,200
married to these soups. I think it's a

757
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,000
good reason for it. All right.

758
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,320
Delicious. Finally, roasted cauliflower

759
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,720
soup with a parsley salad bruschetta.

760
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,840
Both again, this is classy. classy way

761
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,840
of thinking something so good for us and

762
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,760
making it taste unbelievable. Everybody

763
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,480
loves cream soups, but again, cream

764
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,679
soups are not great for your figure,

765
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,200
right? Then they're not great for your

766
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,400
arteries. So, this one we just take

767
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,080
cauliflower and put a little bit of

768
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,080
olive oil spray on it or a little

769
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,279
drizzle and toss and then a little

770
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,520
nutmeg, salt and pepper or white pepper.

771
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:34,480
We roast up whole heads of garlic so

772
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,960
it's sweet and delicious and not sharp

773
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,279
and bitter at all. We roast this and

774
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,200
paste it. And then we take the roasted

775
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,279
cauliflower and you just puree it with

776
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,039
stock vegetable or chicken. I'm going to

777
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,400
serve up a here. I'm going to serve up a

778
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,480
warm one. This one's staying nice and

779
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,559
hot. And then I put a little bit of

780
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,159
extra roasted cauliflower on top. It

781
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,120
tastes creamy and delicious. And all

782
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,720
this is is eating a giant bowl of

783
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,679
cauliflower and stock and roasted

784
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,679
garlic. It's so good for

785
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,679
you and cruciferous vegetables, right?

786
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,039
They are so good for you nutritionally.

787
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,880
The best way to detox your liver. But

788
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,559
look at how you're doing it. I And you

789
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,120
can't mess it up. It's basically the

790
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,039
simple stuff. It's so like rich and

791
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,720
heavy and hearty and it's just

792
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,000
vegetables. I can taste the fresh herbs.

793
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,760
It's got this little brightness to it

794
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
from the lemon. Yeah. I always finish

795
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,000
soups with a little bit of acid. And

796
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,919
this all these soups you added a little

797
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,320
lemon or lime to. All of the soups have

798
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,000
a little bit of acidity. In Italian

799
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
cooking, it's very important to finish

800
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,279
with a little lemon juice or to add some

801
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,360
white wine. Acidity is the balance to

802
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,799
the salt and the the earthiness of our

803
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,000
dishes. The leftover white wine. What

804
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,440
you haven't what you haven't finished.

805
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,080
Yeah, there like there's ever leftover

806
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,919
wine in my house.

807
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,480
And then the first word was veno.

808
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,200
There's no leftover wine in my house. We

809
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,799
have bottles, not glasses. Sorry. So, on

810

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,520
We're back with Rachel Ray. Advice for

840
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,679
young women who want to be chefs, young

841
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,120
women who want to be like you. Well, you

842
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,279
know, I think uh my best advice for

843
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,039
anyone is to value work itself. You

844
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,640
know, my mom taught me from the time I

845
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,480
was very young that work is a privilege

846
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,720
and if you work very hard and you're

847
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,240
grateful for every job you have in life,

848
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,640
I really believe especially in this

849
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,720
country, you will go forward. So you be

850
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,919
successful at whatever you want to do. I

851
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,440
also believe

852
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:19,840
whether whether you want to be a chef or

853
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,279
not. I also believe very deeply that

854
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,279
when I was a kid and you went to public

855
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,840
school, everybody got home. Everybody

856
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,840
got shop class. You learned how to fix a

857
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,080
car, sew a button, make your own food.

858
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,159
Basic trades. Yeah. Everyone should

859
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,159
learn the basics of cooking good

860
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,080
nutritious food. It helps your

861
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,679
pocketbook. It certainly improves the

862
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,919
quality of your life and the length of

863
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,840
your life. It is an essential skill for

864
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,960
everyone, not just people that want to

865
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,640
cook for a living in in my opinion. I

866
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,279
the issue of the of the role of women in

867
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,320
this process is critical to you and I

868
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,600
think it's something I want to spend a

869
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,200
second on. Now the culinary world is

870
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,039
dominated by male chefs which is always

871
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,440
surprising to me. So what can women do

872
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,600
to become those chefs? I think that you

873
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,520
know as in any profession the person

874
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,679
best qualified for the job deserves that

875
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,600
job but there is a a big discrepancy in

876
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,600
the number of women. You know at our

877
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
magazine we try and celebrate women with

878
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,720
a cover that we do called like a boss

879
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,559
right so last year we did uh a big issue

880
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,799
about it and and I had all these great

881
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,760
female chefs on our show. This year we

882
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,480
wanted to go back and represent women of

883
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,559
color that are boss chefs. It's hard to

884
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,600
find. You know what I mean? That we have

885
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,520
to really nurture our young people and

886
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,000
if they're into it, give them the same

887
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,919
the same respect across the board for a

888
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,760
man and a woman in the kitchen or any

889
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,519
place else. But I really I really think

890
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,760
that that's changing and the tide is

891
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,600
turning and I think that just having the

892
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,679
conversation about it like at this

893
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,000
year's um food and wine festival here in

894
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,480
New York, we're doing a supper is served

895
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,679
event. It's all female mixologists and

896
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,480
chefs and Giata Darentes and Alex

897
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:00,480
Garnerelli. Um myself, everybody all

898
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,399
Martina McBride is performing. It's a

899
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,000
real celebration of what women are doing

900
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,440
and how innovative they are in the

901
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,159
kitchen. Let me high five you on that

902
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,559
because high 10. I talk to Daphne about

903
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,039
this all the time and I see as a young

904
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,600
woman who's trying to become like you,

905
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,760
right? It's it is challenging in ways I

906
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,279
never anticipated. And like you, I want

907
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,640
the best person to do the best job,

908
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,080
right? But but I want everyone to be

909
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,279
able to play on to have the same

910
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,799
advantage is is is all we're asking. Get

911
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,559
everyone on the field and then let the

912
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,159
best player win. Respect, right? And to

913
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,519
just get the same respect. I love

914
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,399
everything you stand for. Love you

915
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:37,600
person as well. It's our 13th. Lucky 13.

[Applause]

936
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,159
[Music]

937
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,760
We're celebrating our 10th season and

938
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,399
we're not turning back. We're looking

939
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,080
forward to our next 10 and yours. All

940
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,919
year long, we're challenging you to

941
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,640
discover your health and life goals for

942
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,080
your next 10. 10 days, 10 weeks, 10

943
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,399
years. Share your goals at #myx10 and

944
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,519
you can win prizes or even end up right

945
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,679
here on my show. It happens to all of

946
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,880
us. You walk through the door after a

947
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,519
tough day and it's chaos. Dinner isn't

948
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,159
cooked. Laundry isn't done. You kick off

949
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,320
your shoes and step on something. Ow.

950
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,960
And you're ready to blow a gasket.

951
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,600
Instead, pause for a moment and take

952
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,600
five deep

953
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
breaths.

954
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,919
[Music]

955
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:05,519
Ah, everyone do it together. So nice. No

956
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,600
matter where the stress in your life is

957
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,919
coming from, today I have the self-care

958
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,000
regimen to help you go from manic to

959
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,399
mindful in just minutes. And I've

960
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,919
enlisted the help of Dr. Taz Batia,

961
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,760
integrated physician and health and

962
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,679
wellness expert who's here on behalf of

963
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,200
our trusted sponsorship partner, Dr.

964
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,639
Teals. Thank you for being here very

965
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,000
much. As you all know, right,

966
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,760
mindfulness is what we all try to

967
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,040
achieve, but it's hard to do that

968
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,960
because the stress gets in the way

969
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,800
crazily. So, why is it so important to

970
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,720
helping us cope? You know, Dr. Oz,

971
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,359
mindfulness is a mental state that's

972
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,919
achieved when we focus our awareness on

973
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,879
the present moment, calmly acknowledging

974
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,800
our thoughts and our feelings. It is not

975
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,159
easy to be mindful today between

976
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,960
technology, being on 24/7, juggling kids

977
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,040
and work and family. It is so important

978
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,000
to slow down that frenetic pace and

979
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:56,000
really take a moment to relax, rest, and

980
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,320
kind of recharge the mind. We know that

981
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,800
that's so critical and nowadays

982
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,880
mindfulness is a necessity. It's not a

983
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,720
luxury because we have to be the most

984
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,200
productive versions of ourselves. And

985
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,280
what I see in practice is that all of

986
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,280
this really affects women the most

987
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,440
because they are juggling everything,

988
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,280
everyone else's needs and often

989
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,680
neglecting their own health. The whole

990
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,040
audience is going like this. But how to

991
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,440
do it? That's the challenge. You have a

992
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,800
hack for us. I do. So mindfulness,

993
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,400
remember, is achieved when we're in the

994
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,839
present moment. And there are so many

995
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,160
different ways to do this. You can do

996
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,920
yoga, you can meditate, getting

997
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,160
exercise, getting proper sleep. Those

998
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,240
are all ways to be mindful. But the key

999
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,560
is creating a space for mindfulness,

1000
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,119
creating that zen. I like to do it by

1001
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,160
finding a pre-sleep routine. And Dr.

1002
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,160
Teal's Epsom salts is an easy solution.

1003
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,920
Now, again, we can all run to yoga, try

1004
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,320
to find time to meditate, but what's

1005
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,079
easier than soaking in Dr. Teal's Epsom

1006
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,599
salts a couple times a week. For me,

1007
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,440
everybody, an Epsom salt bath really,

1008
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,800
it's like yoga for the brain. Yes. It

1009
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,920
just puts you in this place. First of

1010
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,079
all, you're not going to be doing

1011
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,119
technology. And I think this is a hack

1012
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,760
that works because your body unwinds and

1013
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,760
as it begins to let go, your mind can

1014
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,400
also. It's probably the single biggest

1015
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,400
adult tool that I use to get myself into

1016
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,680
the right frame of mind. So, first off,

1017
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,560
let's talk about Epsom salts. Most

1018
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,000
people don't know what they are. They've

1019
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,599
seen them on the Dr. Teal's bag, but

1020
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
what does that actually mean? Yeah. So,

1021
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,920
Epsom salts are a compound of magnesium

1022
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,359
sulfate. They are a great natural

1023
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,760
alternative to over-the-counter

1024
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,599
medications and prescription drugs. Most

1025
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,440
people maybe already know about Epsom

1026
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,200
salts because they relieve those achy

1027
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,440
muscles, that body soreness that you

1028
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,440
might feel from time to time, but at the

1029
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,800
same time, Epsom salts are delivering

1030
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,640
that same magnesium to the entire body.

1031
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,320
They also offer a triple threat,

1032
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,400
especially Dr. Teal's Epsom salts, they

1033
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,240
offer a triple threat of benefits when

1034
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,839
we're trying to achieve mindfulness

1035
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,400
because in addition, we have the benefit

1036
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,960
of the essential oils like lavender that

1037
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,480
promote sleep, promote rest, and what's

1038
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,240
more relaxing finally than taking a

1039
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,280
bath. So, show me how to make them.

1040
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,480
Here's the thing about the smell. You

1041
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,960
since you touched on it and the

1042
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,720
lavender, it bypasses your thinking. It

1043
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,480
goes right to the middle of your brain,

1044
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,880
the reptilian part of our brain. That's

1045
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,640
why smells affect us so much. And I

1046
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,000
think that's important tool we don't use

1047
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,200
enough to get ourselves in the right

1048
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
mental set. Okay. Show us how you make

1049
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,640
the So, the first rule of thumb when

1050
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,720
we're making this is to make sure the

1051
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,040
water is warm, not hot. So, we want warm

1052
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
water. We want two generous cups of the

1053
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,280
Dr. Teal's Epsom salt. We're going to

1054
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,359
pour that directly into the water. And

1055
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,960
then you want to soak maybe twice a week

1056
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,440
for about 20 minutes. And what's

1057
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,599
happening here is it takes about 5 to 10

1058
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,440
minutes for that relaxation response to

1059
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,520
really set in and for that stress to

1060
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,119
melt away. And use that time as an

1061
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,280
opportunity maybe use that time to

1062
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,440
breathe and really try to visualize the

1063
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,280
person that you want to be. And also a

1064
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,640
lot of folks get so darn busy, right?

1065
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,000
They don't have time to do this. So we

1066
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,640
made it easy. We sent a bunch of our

1067
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,480
viewers home with Dr. Teal's Epsom salt

1068
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,240
and we asked them to take a bath with it

1069
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,400
at least twice a week. So come on over

1070
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,760
here. We've got the five folks who

1071
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,880
volunteered to come in the studio and

1072
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,560
talk about this with us. Thank you for

1073
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,320
being here. Right now, wellness for

1074
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,040
everybody at home. Wellness may start in

1075
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,720
your head, but I think I'm going to

1076
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,480
applaud you for taking a little load off

1077
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,839
your feet and enjoying because this is

1078
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,960
not a bad way of getting there either.

1079
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,079
Just getting your feet to relax. So,

1080
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,920
Dip, we're going to start with you.

1081
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,920
Before we started this program with you,

1082
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,440
how are you dealing with stress? Well,

1083
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,520
you know, I have three kids. One of

1084
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,480
them's very young. By the end of the

1085
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,240
day, I I'm on sensory overload. I've got

1086
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,800
diaper sense. I've got people who've

1087
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,040
been hanging all over my ever since. I

1088
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,440
love this. That's right. And you know,

1089
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,880
just I've just had I've had enough. I

1090
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,160
don't want anyone touching me. My poor

1091
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,839
husband comes home at the end of the day

1092
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,560
and wants a hug. And I'm just like, "No,

1093
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,400
just nobody touch me anymore. I'm done.

1094
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,280
I need these kids in bed and I just want

1095
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,280
my body back to myself." So, how's Dr.

1096
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,359
Teal's Epsom salt baths helped you?

1097
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,040
How's it helped you cope? So, when I

1098
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,200
finally got them to leave me alone for

1099
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,680
the 20 minutes so I could soak in the

1100
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,320
bath, um, you know, I I really I felt

1101
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,560
like I I felt that sensory overload

1102
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,560
really just kind of leaving me into the

1103
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,320
water and just having that alone time to

1104
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,839
breathe in the scent. It's worth the

1105
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,119
invest. Congrats on the kids. Thank you,

1106
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,200
Caroline. How has it changed your life

1107
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,800
to be epaltting batting your way through

1108
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,720
life? Yeah, I think it just kind of

1109
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,160
helped with being more mindful like you

1110
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,920
said. You know, I was sitting there. I

1111
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,400
had nothing to do. I chose not to listen

1112
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,240
to music. I chose not to read. I have a

1113
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,200
really nice bathroom. So, I just sat in

1114
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,000
it and just soaked. And then I felt

1115
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:22,000
actually I was quite tired afterwards,

1116
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,280
funny enough, and I just fell asleep.

1117
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,119
Probably got a good night's sleep. I

1118
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,440
did. Yes. And to me, what would you say

1119
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,119
to folks who are struggling to find time

1120
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,040
just to get into an Epsom salt bath and

1121
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,359
let this happen? I would tell them is

1122
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,440
definitely worth the time. Take the 20

1123
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,119
minutes because it's worth it. the days

1124
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,720
that I didn't use it, I said, "Man, I

1125
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,400
wish if I would have just taken that 20

1126
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,960
minutes, the rest of my day would have

1127
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,560
been better." So, I don't think if I'm

1128
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,240
taking I don't have enough time. I'm

1129
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,920
thinking this will give me more time

1130
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,760
because I'll be more relaxed. I'll be

1131
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,520
able to get through my day. So, it's

1132
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,800
definitely worth it making that time.

1133
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,320
So, you think everyone here ought to be

1134
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,320
spending a little more time sitting

1135
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,680
sitting in a Dr. Teal's Epsom salt bath?

1136
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Yes, absolutely. Are you guys interested

1137
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,880
in this at all? Yes. Well, I'm glad you

1138
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,359
are cuz guess what? This fantastic news

1139
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,040
is Dr. Teal's lavender pure Epsom salt

1140
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,000
soak is going to be yours. That's thanks

1141
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,880
to the company that's sending you home

1142
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,560
with a bag of it. So enjoy

1143
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,640
yourselves and thanks to Dr. Taz Bati

1144
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,860
and our trusted sponsor Dr. Kes for all

1145
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,839
that. We'll be right back.

1146
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,320
[Applause]

1147
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,079
He was very creepy. He asked me to

1148
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,040
undress and he watched me while I did

1149
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,599
so. The university gynecologist accused

1150
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,160
by over 300 women of the most

1151
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,839
unspeakable crimes. These young women

1152
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,470
were violated. All new

1153
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:41,860
Oz. That's coming up

1154
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,860
[Music]

1155
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,560
tomorrow. What if I told you that you

1156
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,920
could have your cake and eat it too?

1157
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,640
That you can make a delicious chocolate

1158
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,520
cake without butter or oil? Believe me?

1159
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,640
Yeah. What? Instead, you can use this

1160
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,760
eggplant. Yes. You're thinking eggplant.

1161
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,599
not bubb. When my team saw that eggplant

1162
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,280
chocolate cake recipes were taking over

1163
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,359
the internet, I needed to know if they

1164
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,720
would work. So, I listed two of my go-to

1165
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,560
testers, Bianca and Nephe, and they

1166
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,200
agreed very

1167
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,480
bravely try it out. So, one of you made

1168
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,079
a regular cake and one of you made the

1169
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,440
cake with the eggplant where you swap

1170
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,960
out the butter and the oil. Is that

1171
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,480
correct? Yes. All right. So, I'm not

1172
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,440
supposed to know which one is which. I'm

1173
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,040
just going to put them right here so the

1174
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,960
audience can look at this with me. So,

1175
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,880
as I look at these, this is a little

1176
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,240
drier looking. So, normally you think

1177
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,680
that might not have all the butter and

1178
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,359
the oil that you want, but I don't know.

1179
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,040
But Bianca, you go first. You know, let

1180
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,440
me just taste it first. You're messing

1181
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,160
me

1182
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,760
up. That's so

1183
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,920
thick. Good mouth feel. Fills everything

1184
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,160
up.

1185
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,160
Clearly a worthy thing to eat. And this

1186
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,599
is also good. I'll tell you, this is a

1187
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,680
little better from my perspective, but I

1188
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,760
could see why you love them both. So,

1189
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,079
come clean now. Who made the eggplant? I

1190
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,280
did. This is the eggplant one. Yes. Can

1191
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,640
you believe it? It's actually better

1192
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,800
than the regular cake. That's what I

1193
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,680
think, too. Bianca, taste that. See what

1194
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,560
you think about. I want an honest

1195
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,640
opinion. Would you do it again? Would

1196
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,319
you? I would. Why not? I'm a foodie and

1197
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,040
it's a healthy version of something I

1198
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,440
love. Why not? All right. So, Nephi's

1199
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,000
eggplant version has onethird of the

1200
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,440
calories less. That's worth the

1201
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,960
investment. Eggplants, great way to add

1202
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,440
more fiber to your diet as well. We're

1203
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,160
going to have Nephy's eggplant recipe as

1204
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,680
eggplant chocolate cake recipe on

1205
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,440
dr.com. Your friends will be so jealous.

1206
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,720
They'll be like Bianca over here. Just

1207
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,560
won't want to admit it even though they

1208
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,839
they like it. Exactly. Together, change

1209
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,920
is happening, everybody. And our journey

1210
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:47,079
is just beginning. See you next time.

1211
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,079
Thanks. Thank you.
