1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Pre-marinated meat is quick and full of

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,080
flavor, which makes putting dinner on

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,559
the table that much easier. But is it

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,719
safe to eat, or will you be sorry you

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,240
took the shortcut? We're kind of paying

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,920
for a lot of stuff that really we're not

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,839
going to be able to eat. Plus, a food

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
investigation. How does it spread? How

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,080
do they melt? How do they taste? Is

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,920
there a better butter? Buttery spreads

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,279
and spreadable butter, they couldn't be

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,279
more different. There's a difference.

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,279
There's a huge difference. Coming up

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,279
next.

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,520
Y'all ready for season 10? Yeah.

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,320
[Music]

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,460
I love you back.

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,460
[Music]

19
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:54,160
[Applause]

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,480
When it comes to supermarket stuff,

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,039
convenience is king. That's why I know

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,800
so many of you love to buy pre-marinated

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
meats. Now, besides the cooking, right,

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,400
all the prep work is done for you, which

25
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,479
makes putting dinner on the table that

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,360
much easier. But our grocery store

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,040
pre-marinated meats safe to eat or you

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,799
end up being sorry you took the

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
shortcut. I've asked several audience

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,000
member to participate in this. Tamara

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,920
and her husband Mike are here. They are

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,640
at odds over pre-marinated meats.

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,080
And it's the only meat that Mike will

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,360
buy. But Tamara, you've got some

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,360
concerns. So, why do you love it so

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,200
much? I like pre- marinated meat

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,040
basically cuz uh I can come home, I can

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
pop it in the oven, I can put it on the

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,000
grill. I can I mean, it's already done

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,720
for me. It tastes even a guy could do

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,720
it. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Tammy, you're

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,159
unsure about these. What's What gives? I

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,040
kind of feel like it's not going to be

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,280
as healthy as just regular meat. I know

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
exactly what's going in it if I'm

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,720
putting my own seasonings on it. Lot of

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,560
wisdom to what women say. You probably

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,000
learned that. Absolutely. Yeah. You'll

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,439
get the lesson if you haven't yet. All

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,880
right. Here's why. I got some experts

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,479
here. We'll help figure this out. This

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,920
is something I've been looking at a lot.

53
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,479
I think we can actually open it up a

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,399
little bit. So, to bottom to to a bigger

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,680
light, award-winning chef Sheamus Mullen

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,920
is here, and Sheamus has built his

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,160
career around sourcing the very best and

58
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,119
sustainable meats. So, break it down for

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,319
us. Welcome to the show. Good to see

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,680
you. Good to see you. So, you saw Tar

61
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,760
Mike there struggling. When it says

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,360
pre-marinated like this does, what does

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,720
it mean? And what does it mean if you

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
get it from the butcher that way? So,

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,720
they're basically when we're talking

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
about marinades, we're talking about two

67
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,120
different things. Either you go to the

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
supermarket and you get something from

69
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,080
the butcher that they've made and

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,599
prepared for you or you get something

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,280
that's pre-marinated that's packaged

72
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
from the manufacturer. The difference

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,319
mainly is that you kind of have a better

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,760
sense of what's going into this. There's

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,920
nutrition facts on the back of this, you

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
know, tell you exactly what's in there.

77
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,239
So, those are the two kinds of marinade

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,519
meats we're talking about. See, I

79
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,959
thought the butcher in the store made

80
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,920
this. This is from a a company. This is

81
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,840
going to come directly from the

82
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,360
manufacturer. Okay. So, break down

83
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
marination for us. What does it all mean

84
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,080
to you? So, when we're marinating,

85
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,200
there's basically two things that we're

86
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,879
talking about. We're talking about uh

87
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
enhancing the flavor. So that'll come

88
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,920
from different flavoring agents and then

89
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
tenderizing the meat. Those are the two

90
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
elements that we're talking about.

91
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,239
Flavorizing and tenderizing. All right.

92
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,519
So we asked all of you at home what

93
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,680
kinds of concerns you had about

94
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,319
pre-marinated meat. Maria on Facebook

95
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,519
asks, "My supermarket charges more per

96
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,840
marinated meat per pound. Is this extra

97
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,959
charge worth it?" It's a good question.

98
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,080
Very good question. There is some liquid

99
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,360
in this thing. Oh yeah, there's quite a

100
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,720
bit of liquid. So when we're talking

101
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,159
about meat, we're actually talking about

102
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,000
a significant amount of liquid in the

103
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,200
meat already. But now here we have a

104
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
piece of chicken breast. If you look at

105
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,000
it, weighs about what do we have there?

106
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,599
Uh 6 oz. almost 7 oz. Yeah. So, we've

107
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,879
got that and then we've got the same

108
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,000
breast which weighed the same amount.

109
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,000
Now, it's in a marinade. We're going to

110
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,280
put it on and you're going to see this

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,560
is good. 9 oz. So, 3 o 10 o. Yeah. So,

112
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,480
we're almost at 10 ounces. So, about 4

113
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,760
ounces more. And that's all water

114
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
essentially. So, we're kind of paying

115
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400
for a lot of stuff that really we're not

116
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
going to be able to eat and get much out

117
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,159
of. Mike, did you hear that?

118
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,360
Paying a lot of money. Wasted money. All

119
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,760
right. All right, so Linda asked via

120
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,760
Twitter, "Did I heard two of Marcus

121
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,159
marinate old meat they can't sell to

122
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,440
mask the smell? Is that true?" I decided

123
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,200
to go straight to the source to figure

124
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,360
this one out. Not just a butcher, but

125
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,360
someone I consider the butcher. James

126
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,360
Perk

127
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,400
is the co-founder of Porter Road, a

128
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
butcher shop that makes some of the

129
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
country's highest quality meats

130
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
available to people nationwide. So is

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
it, you know, it concerns the doctor

132
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,640
that you might get sick for meat? That

133
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,159
question comes up a lot. Could that

134
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
really happen?

135
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,040
You can always get sick from things you

136
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,000
are eating. That is true. Um, and the

137
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,800
myth of are we masking something with

138
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,560
the marinade? Yes, that is true. But

139
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,479
nobody's going to sell you rotten meat

140
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,919
knowingly. It's bad for business. It's

141
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,320
not going to work out very well in the

142
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,680
long run. Um, but what they are masking

143
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,440
is oxidation, a little bit of

144
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,840
colorization. Nothing that's going to

145
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,360
harm the flavor or you as a consumer.

146
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,440
So, you would feed it to your family, I

147
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,440
gather. Absolutely. Absolutely. And a

148
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,880
lot of the times marination, uh, what

149
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,720
they're trying to do, like I said, is

150
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,280
just color cover up a little bit of

151
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,720
oxidation because like I said before, if

152
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,160
your consumer gets sick, they're not

153
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,000
coming back to you. Tam, you hear that?

154
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,680
You're worried about nothing. Listen to

155
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the man. All right. Thank you, James.

156
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,040
You're wrecked via Facebook, are

157
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,160
pre-marinated meats basically a sodium

158
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,520
bath? How unhealthy are they? So, what

159
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
is the deal with the amount of sodium in

160
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,479
these marinades? This is a really,

161
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,840
really great question. And in fact, uh,

162
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,360
Cooking Light did an experiment where

163
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,160
they took a turkey, they took three

164
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,080
turkeys, and they, um, they they brine

165
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,080
them for 12 hours, for 18 hours, and for

166
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,680
24 hours with a half a cup of kosher

167
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,800
salt, which is a lot of sodium. You

168
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
know, that's a significant amount of

169
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
sodium. But what they found was that

170
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,039
after 12 hours, the sodium content

171
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,120
actually only gone up by 1%. And then

172
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,560
after that, it didn't go up anymore. So,

173
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,320
what ended up happening in the the

174
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,039
subsequent hours, in the 18 and then in

175
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,280
the 24 hours, is you got a more tender

176
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,120
turkey, but no more sodium. So, it's not

177
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,360
actually as bad as you might think. I'm

178
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,479
surprised it's only 1%. Only one%. I

179
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
looked at the salt content. I'll tell

180
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,000
you the bigger issue when when I know

181
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,759
this is to make sure you're looking for

182
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,360
sugar in the marin. Exactly. That's

183
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,800
especially if you're doing keto, it can

184
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
sabotage everything. It would actually

185
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,840
come along with the sugar this time.

186
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,000
Absolutely. All right. Next thing we

187
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,000
want to know about curious about is how

188
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,440
much does marinating change the flavor

189
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,680
and how long do you really have to

190
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,360
marinade in order to get the effects? To

191
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,039
put this to the test, we're going to do

192
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
a little marinating science here. I

193
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,720
brought in someone who really tastes the

194
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
nuances of flavor. A professional taste

195
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,680
tester. That's what she does for a

196
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,639
living. Professional taste testing. Ivy

197
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,759
Kolicker from Century Spectrum. Before

198
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,199
we get to all this. Yes. I mean, do you

199
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,880
study to become a taste tester? How how

200
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,520
does that work? Are you gifted with

201
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,280
incredible taste buds? Sure. So, I have

202
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,960
a background in food science and we go

203
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,560
through a lot of training and have a lot

204
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,080
of education, practice, and experience

205
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,759
to be able to describe the

206
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,520
characteristics of food. So, it's not

207
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,880
that I can taste better than you can.

208
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,560
It's that I have more words to describe

209
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,479
the flavor and the texture. So, we could

210
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,520
taste what you taste. Yes, absolutely.

211
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
Give me some words I should be using

212
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,880
next time I go to a meal to impress my

213
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
wife. Sure. So, if you want to talk

214
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,680
about the texture, which a lot of people

215
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,520
have trouble talking about, you can

216
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
start thinking about how the food is

217
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,199
kind of chewing down in your mouth. Is

218
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,600
it soft? Is it tough? Is it fibrous? Is

219
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,280
it mealy? Is it very moist and juicy? Or

220
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,720
is it very dry? Hopefully not dry. If

221
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,360
you're eating something moist and juicy

222
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
is good. And the full compression fiber

223
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,400
length that comes up sometimes.

224
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
Absolutely. Absolutely. And we'll see

225
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
that here with the chicken. I'm going to

226
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,960
seem so smart next time I go out. We set

227
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,080
up a taste experiment and one that's

228
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,080
very practical for all of us to know

229
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,680
about. We marinated chicken, right, for

230
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,160
three different time intervals. There's

231
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,840
30 minutes, there's 2 hours, and then

232
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,400
there's the overnight, you know, if

233
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,080
you're really prepared in life. So, how

234
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,160
much did the time it was marinated

235
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,199
actually change the flavor? I I'm going

236
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
leave it to you as the expert. Give us

237
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,759
your professional assessment. You have

238
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,440
tasted them all. So, you were talking

239
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,520
about flavor and texture changes from

240
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,919
the marinade. So, in my tasting, what I

241
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,360
saw is the 30inut meat had the most

242
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,120
chicken flavor and the least amount of

243
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
marinade flavor and also had a tougher

244
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,680
and more fibrous texture. So, some of

245
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,919
those longer, more stringy fibers um and

246
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
took more chews to kind of break down in

247
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,759
the mouth before you wanted to swallow

248
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,440
it. At 2 hours, I didn't see a huge

249
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,120
change in texture, but I did see an

250
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
increase in the marinade flavor and a

251
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,560
decrease in the chicken flavor coming

252
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,240
through. So, if you still like some of

253
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
that kind of more meaty texture and you

254
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
want a little more flavor, I would

255
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,840
recommend the 2hour. Um, at the

256
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,240
overnight, I definitely saw a big change

257
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,000
in the texture. It's much softer, much

258
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
easier to bite through. The muscle

259
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,360
fibers break down into kind of shorter

260
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,120
pieces, so it's a little bit easier to

261
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,039
chew. You can chew it up more quickly,

262
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,120
and it by far had the most flavor of the

263
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,160
three. So, it really is customized to

264
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
what you want. They're all fine.

265
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,960
Absolutely. But I can offer one thought

266
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,039
as a physician on this. I do think

267
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,560
marinating makes sense because it

268
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,479
reduces some of these cancer-causing

269
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,120
compounds that you make when you heat up

270
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,479
meat. So marinated to keep the outside a

271
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,080
little cooler to avoid some of those

272
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,919
products. Okay, great. Right. We all

273
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,919
benefit from this. Thank you. Cheers,

274
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,399
come over here. She says that

275
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,880
pre-marinated typically means over

276
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,560
marinated. So how do you over marinate

277
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,240
meat? So first let's talk about flavor.

278
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,680
First of all, you're going to the

279
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,120
molecules of a lot of the flavoring

280
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,240
agents are too big to actually go into

281
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,000
the meat. they're going to bounce off

282
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,839
the meat after a long period of time.

283
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,519
But when it comes to the salt and acid,

284
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,040
once they get in there, they can change

285
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,800
the texture. The salt will toughen it

286
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,000
up, give it sort of like a ham texture,

287
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,440
and the acid will start to break down

288
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,880
the fibers and make it mushy. So, if

289
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,160
you're letting it go for too long,

290
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,839
you're not getting any more flavor

291
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,519
benefits, and you're changing uh the

292
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,200
texture to a negative texture. So, how

293
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,120
much is too long in your opinion? In my

294
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,640
opinion, if you go over 24 hours, it's

295
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,080
too long, right? So, you all got your

296
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,440
rules of thumb now. Keeping keeping them

297
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,399
in mind from an expert. When you come

298
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,839
back, we're going to break down the

299
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,519
science behind the best marriage that

300
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,880
you can do at home. It has only four

301
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,020
ingredients and it takes less than an

302
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,160
hour. Stay with us.

303
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,160
[Applause]

304
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,600
A trail of unsolved murders in

305
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,640
California. Now 50 years later, can DNA

306
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,560
evidence track down the Zodiac Killer?

307
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,480
We can take these crime cases that have

308
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,120
haunted us for decades and actually

309
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,120
solve them. Plus, a medical error ended

310
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,320
this innocent 2-year-old's life. What

311
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,560
you're supposed to get, what was

312
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,720
actually given, it was tragic. Now the

313
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,200
family comes face to face with the man

314
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
that made this deadly mistake. All new

315
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,680
Oz.

316
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,680
That's coming up tomorrow.

317
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,480
[Music]

318
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,560
If you want the most tender, succulent,

319
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,160
juicy marinated meat without putting in

320
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,240
the time listen up because we're going

321
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,000
to reveal the science behind what makes

322
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,839
the very best marinade that can be done

323
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
in under an hour. Meat expert and

324
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,000
renowned chef Sheamus Mullen is back

325
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
with us. So, what what cuts of meat

326
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,720
benefit the most from marination? So,

327
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,240
here's the deal. Meat is mostly water.

328
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,920
So, if you think of meat like a sponge,

329
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
we've got a sponge here. If it's soaked

330
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,440
with water, you can't really absorb more

331
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,839
water. You can't clean up a mess. We

332
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,600
want to look for small, thin, thin

333
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,959
strips of meat. Those will it's more

334
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
like a surface treatment. So, just

335
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,399
include. So, this is this is what a big

336
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,600
big piece of meat. Exactly. It's not

337
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,760
going to absorb much more of the

338
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,600
marinade, but a thin piece like, you

339
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,360
know, a thin piece of meat is a is going

340
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,440
to give a nice uh surface treatment. So,

341
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,640
what we did to show this, it's pretty

342
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,399
interesting. We took a nice, really

343
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,160
plump piece of chicken, and we've

344
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,959
marinated overnight in a marinade that's

345
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,600
got some blue uh food dye in it, so we

346
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,720
can see just how far it penetrates into.

347
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,160
Talk about a world class chef. Doesn't

348
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,200
this look tasty? It looks amazing,

349
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,959
right, guys? Smurf food. Smurf food. So,

350
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
you left it overnight. The best that our

351
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,519
marinade would do normally. Exactly. So,

352
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,160
this is a 24-hour marinade. And what

353
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,279
we're going to see here is that

354
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,000
it really did not penetrate at all. It's

355
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,200
just on the surface of the meat. Yeah.

356
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
Pretty amazing. See that? That's

357
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
surprising. Actually, I thought a little

358
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,279
bit would get into the inside. Yeah, it

359
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,040
really is just on the outside. And if

360
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,560
you think of it, because there is so

361
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,320
much liquid inside, you just can't put

362
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,680
more liquid into it. All right. So, you

363
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,959
say you've got a little hack for us. One

364
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,560
that may actually allow us to penetrate

365
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,560
the meat a little better. Only four

366
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,640
ingredients. And if we are late like I

367
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,920
usually am in 1 hour, a guy could

368
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,760
actually help out at home and make this

369
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,760
happen. super easy. And as you know, Dr.

370
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,880
Oz, I'm a big fan of healthy food. This

371
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,560
is all stuff that's naturally

372
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,160
anti-inflammatory and it's very good for

373
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,240
gut health. So, what I've done is I've

374
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,399
got some papaya juice. Now, papaya is a

375
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,320
pre-colian fruit that has been used for

376
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,760
thousands of years to tenderize meats.

377
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
There's enzymes in papaya that help

378
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,200
break down the proteins. It's also

379
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,480
really, really good for uh digestive

380
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,399
enzymes for helping you break down your

381
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,560
food. Has anyone ever used papaya in a

382
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,560
marinade here?

383
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,880
Oh, we've got some papaya over there. In

384
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,519
Mexico. In Mexico. Exactly. Mexico. And

385
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,000
there's no spattering over here.

386
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,800
But that's I that's one handful out of

387
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,079
200 people here. I I this is I'd never

388
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,440
thought of it even, but it makes so much

389
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,480
sense because it gets into the meat. It

390
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,920
gets right into the meat. And if you

391
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,920
want to be really fancy, you can take

392
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
the seeds, dry them, and grind them up

393
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,720
and they get like a peppery spice them,

394
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,240
which is better. Show off your chef. I

395
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,839
know, but I love show off. So, what

396
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,320
we've got, we've got the papaya juice,

397
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,680
we've got some ground coriander seed, a

398
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,120
little bit of cayenne pepper for heat,

399
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,959
and then ginger, which is a natural

400
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,399
anti-inflammatory, and it's great for

401
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,160
gut health. So, we've got all that stuff

402
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,880
together. We'll just literally I put all

403
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,160
the dry ingredients here like that very

404
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,279
simply. And you can get to work on

405
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,839
mixing those in. I'm going to add in the

406
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,360
papaya juice. You can even just crush up

407
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,560
some fresh papaya, too. And then if you

408
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,399
want to make a sauce to go along with

409
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,600
it, some fresh papaya salsa is great.

410
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,360
And that's all it takes. We're going to

411
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,360
add that in. And then add your chicken

412
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,959
directly into that. So, grab that

413
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,320
chicken. That'll go in. And then this

414
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,680
can literally just go into the

415
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,600
refrigerator for half an hour before you

416
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,079
cook it. Because what happens is the

417
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,839
enzymes in the papaya, in all of the uh

418
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,440
the ingredients we've put in here, they

419
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,320
don't become activated until you heat

420
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,760
the chicken up. So between 140 and 175°

421
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,720
is when the enzymes are going to

422
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,320
actually start to break down the

423
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
chicken. So why bother marinating it for

424
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,360
even half an hour? That's not you're

425
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,399
going to some of the flavor is going to

426
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,839
impregnate. You're some of the flavor

427
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,160
from all these great ingredients. So you

428
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,920
will get a little bit of flavor from it.

429
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,519
I mean, significant amount of flavor.

430
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,639
Before I say anything, Tamar and Mike

431
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
are here. They have the finished

432
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,519
product. They've been bickering all show

433
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,200
long. How about this darn pre-marinade

434
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,760
stuff?

435
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,040
So Tamara, you've effectively won the

436
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,800
argument. Did you feel good about that?

437
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,279
I do. I feel great about that. It's a

438
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,360
nice feeling in it. I'm used to it. Used

439
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,920
to it, right? Absolutely. So what do you

440
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,079
think about this? Mine was very good.

441
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,639
It's a light flavor. It's not It's not

442
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,720
overpowering, but it's easy. It's easy

443
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
on the palette. So here's the deal. In

444
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,200
all seriousness, you listen to the show.

445
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,720
There's nothing wrong with buying

446
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,399
premarinated meat. You can do that. But

447
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,600
it seems to me that we've given some

448
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,200
pretty good reasons why you just make it

449
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,720
yourself. And if it tastes like this,

450
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,760
you've tasted it. Would you be willing

451
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,920
to do this instead of buying the

452
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,160
pre-marinated? I would because I love

453
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,600
chicken and I love to eat. You know, you

454
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,040
definitely can taste the flavors. It was

455
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,959
good. I would eat it again. Thanks all

456
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,639
for being here. Sheamus latest book is

457
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,000
called Real Food Heels. Look at him

458
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,700
walking around looking so healthy. We'll

459
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
be right back.

460
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,839
[Applause]

461
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,199
Up next, an investigation into the new

462
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,959
butters on the supermarket shelves

463
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,880
today, including the ones with healthier

464
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,680
oils added to make them more spreadable.

465
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,310
Are they really better? Find out when we

466
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,519
come back.

467
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:34,160
[Music]

468
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,160
Butter. We all love the way it spreads

469
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,839
on a warm piece of bread or how it melts

470
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,240
on an English muffin. You can just see

471
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,959
it right there. Right. Most of all, we

472
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,839
love how it tastes. That creamy, fatty

473
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,600
mouth feel is it's unmatched. But there

474
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,680
are so many butter alternatives in the

475
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
market today, including new ones with

476
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,519
healthier oils added to make them more

477
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,399
spreadable. Today, we're investigating.

478
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,120
Is there a better butter?

479
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,360
Once considered public enemy number one,

480
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,680
super delicious butter is working its

481
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,000
way back into the American household.

482
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,560
From traditional uses like on your toast

483
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,639
and in your cakes to more modern uses

484
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,000
like in your coffee and on top of your

485
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,800
oatmeal, Americans now eat almost 23

486
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,279
sticks a year. But the new market for

487
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,160
healthier butter alternatives is just as

488
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,720
rich with buttery spreads, spreadable

489
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,360
butters, and even avocado butter gaining

490
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,680
in popularity. Are they butters better

491
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,920
half? An important question when there's

492
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,839
no margarine for error.

493
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,680
James Beard, award-winning chef and

494
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,519
restaurant tour Michael Schlow, who has

495
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,199
shared his expertise on the Tonight's

496
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,880
Show, is here with a brand new food

497
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,160
investigation to help cut through the

498
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,320
clutter like a hot knife through through

499
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,079
butter.

500
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,839
Butter is back, everybody. It's big and

501
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,360
everyone loves it. And as a chef, Chef

502
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,720
Michael loves it. Where do you stand, by

503
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,920
the way, this butter renaissance? And

504
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,000
and what about these butter

505
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,279
alternatives? Well, butter being back, I

506
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
mean, as a chef, I never thought it went

507
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,600
away, to be honest with you. I always

508
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,759
thought it was around and I always loved

509
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,639
it. But, you know, as a as a dad, as a

510
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,160
husband, we're always thinking about

511
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,759
butter alternatives, like how can we eat

512
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,600
a little bit healthier. So, this was

513
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,959
exciting. I got to really experiment and

514
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,199
buy a bunch of different kinds and

515
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,959
explore and uh I've got a lot of

516
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,560
different results for you. So, these

517
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,759
better butters, what are they up

518
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,920
against? What are the qualities they've

519
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,680
got to mimic in order to win over a

520
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,720
butter lover like you? And me, too, by

521
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,639
the way. Well, I think you said it

522
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,680
earlier, you know, how does it spread?

523
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,040
You know, so that's the first thing. Is

524
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,240
it going to rip the bread? Cold butter

525
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,680
rips the bread.

526
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,519
These spreadables, are they are they

527
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,440
nice and smooth and creamy? You know,

528
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,880
how do they melt? Uh, I think that's

529
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,160
important also. But most important of

530
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,279
all is how do they taste? If they don't

531
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,360
taste good, we're not going to buy them.

532
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,440
All right. So, we assembled a group of

533
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,920
really purists. These are butter purists

534
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,360
who are looking to be buttered up by us.

535
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,199
Butter purists. I I like I like the

536
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,639
term. That was my uh my band in culinary

537
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,920
school. We were called the butter. Yeah,

538
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,279
that's what we called ourselves. These

539
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,399
are they're looking at better butters

540
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,920
here. They're going to be putting each

541
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
of the butters through a three-part

542
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,360
test. Adriana, your job is to check on

543
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
the spreadability. Yes. Does it rip the

544
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,519
bread or not? Ashley is manning the

545
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,959
melting torch. Let's see the torch. Oh,

546
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,679
look at that. Look at that. Look at her

547
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,520
go. She's She's hot. And Maggie is

548
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,520
cleansing her palette as we speak. She's

549
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,120
ready to taste. Little water, but not

550
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,480
for too long. Okay, we're going to check

551
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,360
in with you in a bit. Let's go over the

552
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,120
first group we're going to be looking

553
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,640
about are these spreadable butters,

554
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,319
right? And the spreadable butters are

555
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
made with vegetable oil, right? They

556
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,600
offer about half the saturated fat,

557
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,760
correct, of butter. So, there's real

558
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,760
butter in spreadable butter. Yes. And so

559
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,520
they do add some oil and there's some,

560
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,200
you know, aside from the saturated fats,

561
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,799
I mean, one of the the benefits, I

562
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,760
guess, is that it does spread easy right

563
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,880
out of the refrigerator. You don't have

564
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,200
to take it out and leave it on your

565
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,720
counter to spread easily. That's to me

566
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,720
one of the biggest um, you know,

567
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,679
advantages in using something like this.

568
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,559
Okay. Next, buttery spreads. These are a

569
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,280
little different. These are also made

570
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,799
with vegetable oil. So, I'm sorry. Well,

571
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,200
these are different for sure. Buttery

572
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,320
spreads and spreadable butter. I I you

573
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,280
know, when I started out on this

574
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
adventure, I didn't know what the

575
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,919
difference would be, and they couldn't

576
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,760
be more different. There's a difference.

577
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,760
There's a huge difference. Um, and we're

578
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,679
going to find out. And so, uh, the

579
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,120
buttery spreads don't have any butter at

580
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,880
all in them. They're all made from oil,

581
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,240
which is, you know, fine. Uh, some of

582
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,679
them even had yogurt, some of the ones

583
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
that I found, but I could tell you that

584
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,720
there's definitely no butter in the

585
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,000
buttery spreads. All right. Besides the

586
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,440
oils, which obviously have to make up

587
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,880
the difference. What else did you find?

588
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,320
Well, I found that, you know, butter

589
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
obviously has two ingredients. Has cream

590
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,720
and it has salt. and buttery spreads

591
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,720
have just a couple extra ingredients

592
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,880
added to them as well to give you that

593
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,320
mouth feel. And uh the science is lost

594
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,919
on me a little bit here, but there's a

595
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,600
lot going into this stuff. And how many

596
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,120
of you knew that a spreadable butter and

597
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,760
and buttery spread were different?

598
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,720
No one, right? Like one person up there.

599
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,200
Literally one person, the entire

600
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,400
audience, 200 people. Yeah. So if if if

601
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
these aren't butter, how are they

602
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,000
different? I mean, they sound like

603
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,080
they're margarine then. Well, similar.

604
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,320
But here's the deal is that butter and

605
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,799
margarine both have a regulation by the

606
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,200
USDA and they have to have 80% fat, but

607
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,880
with a buttery spread, there is no uh

608
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,559
there's no regulation on it at all. So,

609
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,679
it doesn't have to have 80%. Is less fat

610
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,440
a good thing? Well, it can be certainly.

611
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,799
I mean, it depends on diets and things

612
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,039
like that, but for flavor, I mean,

613
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,640
butter certainly has the highest fat and

614
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,280
it has the strongest flavor. I made

615
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
cookies uh with three different uh fats

616
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,080
to see the difference and see how they

617
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,400
would react differently. And definitely

618
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,840
the buttery spread had the a stranger

619
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,120
reaction is the way I could put it

620
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,640
compared to the butter cookie that I

621
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,000
knew. I made chocolate chip cookies and

622
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
I just thought, well, let's see it. Same

623
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,440
oven, same recipe, same quantities. So

624
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,000
one more time. So this you this is a

625
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,240
buttery spread, correct? Right. And that

626
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,360
had it was half and half and cookies

627
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,880
there. We're going to compare that. You

628
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,520
have margarine and margarine didn't have

629
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,039
a big change to the cookie. way. Uh this

630
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,240
one and you could see the color

631
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,400
difference even in just even the way

632
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,400
that spreads out um when you and these

633
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
were baked in the same oven, same time,

634
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,280
same exact recipe. And you made one with

635
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
butter. Yeah. And I think those look

636
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,919
kind of similar. The butter and the

637
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,120
margarine one. They look the same to you

638
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,880
guys. They look same to me. I'm going to

639
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,840
taste them right now. I'm going to taste

640
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
one of these babies. I'm going to

641
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,240
compare it to one of these buttery

642
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,919
spreads. But these are actually look

643
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,280
very different looking. They do. And and

644
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,640
the same amount of scoop. Like when I

645
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,160
when I was trying to measure them out,

646
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,440
it was the same scoop, same everything.

647
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,720
But they definitely bake differently. So

648
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm going to taste this in a second. But

649
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,799
margarine has the same ratio of fat to

650
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,080
water as butter. Right. Correct. But

651
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,919
anyone ever wonder what happened to

652
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,500
margarine? We don't talk about it much

653
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,360
anymore. Take a look.

654
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,520
[Music]

655
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,360
Margarine received bad press for being

656
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,000
made with artificial ingredients and

657
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,679
artery clogging trans fats. But it has

658
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,400
been trying to make a comeback in the

659
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,200
last 10 years.

660
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,000
In fact, last June, the FDA made it

661
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,840
illegal to add trans fats to products,

662
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,640
and they are allowing companies until

663
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,840
January 2020 to completely eliminate

664
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,280
them from their labels. In the meantime,

665
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,760
here's how you can tell if your

666
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,760
margarine or butter alternative is trans

667
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,080
fat-free.

668
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,400
Check the label. Even if it says zero

669
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,760
trans fats, it can legally still contain

670
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,760
up to.5 g of trans fats.

671
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,960
So look for the words partially

672
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,200
hydrogenated on the ingredient list.

673
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,600
Also know that palm, soybean, and

674
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,880
vegetable oil all mean that there may be

675
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,760
trans fats in the product.

676
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,600
So I got I tasted these the the butter

677
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,600
and the margarine, right? And you know

678
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,520
they the spreadable butter. I think this

679
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
is crispy, crunchy. It's got better

680
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,200
mouth feel than the other one. Personal

681
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,799
belief. I I agree with you. It got a

682
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,000
little cakey almost is the word and a

683
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,280
little drier. But when it comes to

684
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,960
baking, definitely I think butter is

685
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,640
going to be better. From a James Beard

686
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,000
chef, we take his advice. Okay. Finally,

687
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,679
the newest kids in the block. Trendy

688
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,520
butters made with Are you ready? Boom.

689
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,840
Avocados

690
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,520
and coconuts.

691
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,120
These are blended with other oils. Often

692
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,799
times they may just have a little bit of

693
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,159
this in there, right? And they

694
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,760
definitely had when I tasted these,

695
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,360
there was some flavor that you could

696
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,799
were distinct, especially the coconut

697
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,200
one. All right, time for our test.

698
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,360
Butter lovers, did you find a better

699
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,200
butter? our butter lovers. I have a

700
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,559
favorite, but you're only looking for

701
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,480
spreadability and you compared

702
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,799
spreadable butter, butter spread,

703
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,240
avocado, and the coconut. Yes. Okay,

704
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,240
take it away. The butter spread. Really?

705
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,360
A butterspread winner. So maybe it was

706
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,360
worth putting all those things in there.

707
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,280
Yeah, for sure. Because I I I'm

708
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,640
surprised cuz the spreadable butter, you

709
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,760
know, I I it seemed to go okay. But look

710
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,200
look, I got all of this. I got all of

711
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,520
the butter spread. Yeah, you colored in

712
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,440
your lines perfectly. Very nice.

713
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,440
Exactly. So, let me go to Ashley.

714
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,000
Melting. You compare all their

715
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,240
meltabilities and the winner is spread.

716
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,240
Oh my goodness. Butter spread again. I

717
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,880
never thought that was possible. I mean,

718
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,159
honestly, coconut oil spread it melted

719
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,919
better. But I like a little bit flavor

720
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,480
in it. Like I want it to be a thick. I

721
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,960
wanted to have still be buttery but melt

722
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,400
and go down easy, I guess. Oh my god. So

723
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,679
yeah, I like the butter spread better.

724
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,760
Did you like the blowtorrch part of the

725
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,720
experiment? That was the best part. And

726
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,039
finally, Maggie, I'm going to leave it

727
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,520
to you, Maggie. On taste, which is what

728
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,799
the chef cares about, who would win? I'm

729
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,640
going to go with the butter spread as

730
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,240
well. Oh my goodness. Science wins here.

731
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,679
Science wins. Oh my goodness. Science

732
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,720
won. You're right. I never would have

733
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,919
expected. I thought everyone would go

734
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,120
with the spreadable butter, but that's

735
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,679
what the win. That's what the data

736
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,000
shows. That's the new healthier butter

737
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,840
that some are saying is the Greek yogurt

738
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,760
of butters. Find out what it is when we

739
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,159
come back.

740
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,600
Greek yogurt.

741
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,840
Today we are having a butter

742
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,440
investigation and spreading the goods on

743
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,120
new trends that could change way you

744
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,330
think about your favorite dairy spread

745
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:28,619
forever. You will not want to miss this.

746
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,619
[Applause]

747
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,080
Welcome back to our butter

748
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,080
investigation. I'm here with Chef

749
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,320
Michael Schlow who's here to spread the

750
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,080
word about the new butter trend getting

751
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,320
all the attention in the dairy aisle

752
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,600
these days. Some even say it is the

753
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,840
Greek yogurt of butters. What is it? Put

754
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,240
the picture up there.

755
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,080
No, Scott. No, that's not the right

756
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,120
picture. That's the ban culture club.

757
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,880
I'm talking about cultured butter. It's

758
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,159
even better.

759
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,600
Many culture club. Chef Michael, there

760
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,440
are many butter roll terms on the market

761
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,280
today and a lot of us have tried them

762
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,720
all, but this has taken over everything.

763
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,720
What makes cultured butter so special?

764
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,720
So, cultured butter is so interesting.

765
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,320
Um, it's like regular butter except for

766
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,000
they've added a little secret

767
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,000
ingredient. There's some some active

768
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,080
bacteria here and it just develops a

769
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,679
whole another flavor. So you can use

770
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,679
live bacteria. Live bacteria goes into

771
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,120
this. Uh it is like Greek yogurt. It is.

772
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,520
Yeah. So I mean whether it's, you know,

773
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,799
using kef kefir or something like uh you

774
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,720
can introduce uh sour cream or

775
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,159
buttermilk. I I made some with uh

776
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,080
yogurt, you know. I mean you can do lots

777
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
of different things, but time is the key

778
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,559
here. So it's uh it's like making wine a

779
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,600
little bit. So the big difference

780
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,440
between regular butter and cultured

781
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,720
butter is bacteria and a little thyme.

782
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,400
And also that flavor. You got that

783
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,919
tanginess, that slightly nuttiness to

784
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
it. I think it's uh it's it's more

785
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,760
interesting quite frankly. Come over

786
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,679
here. I know you brought me a little

787
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,840
present here. Sure, I did. So, I want to

788
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,960
know more about the difference here. So,

789
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,440
you brought me actually you actually

790
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,760
made this yourself. I did. Yes. So, um

791
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,440
heavy cream. You introduce some sort of

792
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,200
bacteria. This is kefir, but you could

793
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,200
do as I said, you know, sour cream or

794
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,400
something else. And after 2 days, this

795
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,679
is what it looked like. You leave it

796
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,640
out, by the way. This guy, you leave it

797
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,240
out. You leave it out. You don't put it

798
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,919
in the refrigerator. It needs to be out

799
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,919
at room temperature or in a warm place

800
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,279
in your kitchen. You got to be kidding.

801
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,600
I'm not kidding. And violates every

802
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,679
premise. I know, right? But this is how

803
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,200
it works. And it really uh it gets a

804
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,480
little bit of that tanginess. And then

805
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,919
what you do is you put it into a

806
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,440
blender. Actually tastes good. It should

807
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,279
taste bad. Just like that would be fine,

808
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,799
right? So you put it into a blender. I

809
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,080
mean, or a food processor like this. And

810
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,600
you just want to you want to cover this

811
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,279
so that you know, nobody gets uh I'll

812
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,360
stand behind you. There we are. Go

813
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,640
ahead, chef. We're good to go here. And

814
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,960
after just about 2 or 3 minutes, it will

815
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,400
break. It will literally break. What do

816
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,120
you mean break? You separate. separates.

817
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,480
Yeah. So, it's getting close. That's

818
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,520
when you get it all over the place. Let

819
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,279
me just see this. I want to see what's

820
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
going on in there. So, we turn it off

821
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,919
and you can see it's starting to

822
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,840
separate. You see that it's starting to

823
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,360
get a little bit of water. Making a mess

824
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,039
is half the fun of the show. Exactly.

825
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,880
Right. So, what ends up happening is you

826
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,200
have buttermilk and then the the culture

827
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,200
butter separates itself and you have to

828
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,120
basically bring it down with a little

829
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,640
bit of cheesecloth and then you end up

830
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,159
uh with something beautiful like this.

831
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,919
It ends up being beautiful, gorgeous

832
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,679
butter. So, why is this a hero for chefs

833
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,200
these days? So, that's an interesting

834
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,559
question. This has a lot of different

835
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,919
properties to it and a lot of different

836
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,200
applications. One of the my favorite

837
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,799
ones to do if you want to look like a

838
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,360
pro at home, use a little bit of

839
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,120
cultured butter to say sear a steak, get

840
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,480
that crispy, crunchy, gorgeous, you

841
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,880
know, brown sear like you see in

842
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,240
restaurants or a piece of fish and a

843
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,120
little goes a long way. You based with

844
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,320
it, you're going to you're going to

845
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,600
impart new flavor to it and you're going

846
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,120
to look like a pro. You're making me

847
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,559
hungry. So, we we know the bacteria is

848
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,919
good for the gut. I want to know if it's

849
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,200
even enough per serving to make a

850
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,880
difference of this bacteria because it

851
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,039
is sort of cool that you're adding it.

852
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,039
So listen, here's the deal. I don't want

853
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,320
you trading your morning yogurt. The

854
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,600
Greek yogurt, especially for buttered

855
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,760
sandwich, it's not quite the same. The

856
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,760
amount of bacteria in this cultured

857
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,360
butter is just not enough to make up for

858
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,640
that. This is for flavor, right? Yeah.

859
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,559
But if you want flavor, you want to make

860
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,240
that meat the way you desired, the fish,

861
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,559
etc. I think it's a brilliant idea and I

862
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,159
love that you celebrate food. Now that

863
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,520
stated, I got one more challenge. We got

864
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,679
two audience members who have been

865
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,600
trying popular hacks, butter hacks from

866
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,120
the internet. So, chef, I want you to

867
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,360
judge whether these are better butter

868
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,640
hacks or are they just bogus butter

869
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,720
hacks. Sounds good. Right. The first

870
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
butter hack is to heat it under a glass.

871
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Mariana, show us how it's done. All

872
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,360
right. You just pour some hot water into

873
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,600
a glass. It's hot. Oh, yeah. It's really

874
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,760
hot. And this this is theoretically

875
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,400
frozen butter. So, it's cold and it's

876
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,120
going to destroy like all sorts of baked

877
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,520
goods you worked all day on.

878
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,600
So, you don't want that. And then you

879
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,520
just keep it under there and kind of And

880
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,360
then just the warmth of the glass is

881
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,360
we'll steam it and soften it. How long

882
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,960
do you have to keep it for? Um about 30

883
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,559
seconds is all you need really. You did

884
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,080
it here, right? Yep. Let's cut the

885
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,320
middle and see if it got into the middle

886
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,000
of it or not. Look at that. That looks

887
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,679
pretty good. That's Oh my goodness, that

888
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,919
actually worked. Is that better? Yeah,

889
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,520
it looks All right. Next butter hack is

890
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,880
to roll it out on plastic wrap. This

891
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,720
again, if it's frozen, you're in a

892
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,720
hurry. You got to get it out. Princess,

893
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,799
show us how it's done. Well, I put the

894
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,520
butter in between the two plastics and I

895
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,880
got to roll in real hard. You saw this

896
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,799
on the internet. I could use a little

897
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,760
bit help. I would do this. This is how I

898
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,799
would do it. This is how I start on the

899
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,559
internet. Like this. I saw this.

900
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,480
What do you think of that idea? I'm

901
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,520
going to go with this is pretty bogus.

902
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,399
Why don't you just leave it out in the

903
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,200
morning? You know, if you know you're

904
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,080
going to bake, why don't you just take

905
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,120
it out of the refrigerator the night

906
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,039
before? Thanks for playing with us,

907
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,399
Princess. Nicely done, Mariana. Chef,

908
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,120
it's been a real pleasure. My pleasure.

909
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,120
Thank you. We'll be right back.

910
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,320
Damon John is revealing why he had to

911
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,159
have unexpected emergency surgery. It's

912
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,640
actually a procedure that one million of

913
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,640
you will be told by a doctor you also

914
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,980
need this year. Stick around to hear the

915
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,600
story.

916
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:39,440
[Applause]

917
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,039
About two months ago, I received an

918
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,880
urgent call from one of my producers

919
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,039
telling me that my friend and Shark Tank

920
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,960
star Damon John had to cancel his

921
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,480
appearance on this show because of a

922
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,399
medical emergency. Now, he was supposed

923
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,360
to be on with Barbara Corkran for a

924
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,200
segment that was going to be pretty

925
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,320
cool, but he was rushed into surgery

926
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,360
just hours beforehand. And then I

927
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,000
received this video message from Damon.

928
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,399
Hey Doc, sorry I can't make the segment

929
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,760
tomorrow. Um, something came up.

930
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,480
But you got Barbara. I know she's not

931
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,480
that bright. Um,

932
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,520
thank you for understanding. See you in

933
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,279
a minute. All right. It's been a little

934
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,039
more than a minute, but Damon is ready

935
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,640
to share with you the shocking health

936
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,640
scare that caused him to have emergency

937
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,559
surgery, a procedure that a million of

938
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,450
you will also need this year. Come on

939
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,650
out, Damon. John.

940
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,130
[Applause]

941
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,420
[Music]

942
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,650
[Applause]

943
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,650
[Music]

944
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,720
Oh yeah.

945
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,440
Oh my goodness. That was funny. Come on

946
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
over here. That was I laughed and

947
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,960
laughed when I got that. I didn't know

948
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,640
you were going to show that video. So we

949
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,480
have they already medicated you when you

950
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,840
recorded that? I'm just curious. Yeah, I

951
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,279
was already juiced up. So

952
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,080
So I haven't showed it to Barbara yet.

953
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,399
Should I? Sure. Absolutely. She'll

954
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,399
agree. She'll agree. How you feeling

955
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,679
now? I am feeling great. I really am.

956
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,600
Yeah. I was very happy for you. I was

957
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,200
very nervous because emergency hernia

958
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,440
operations sometimes happen because you

959
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,880
got having complications. But I love if

960
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,559
you could take us back to that day. What

961
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,240
happened? What went down? When did you

962
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,320
know something was wrong? So it was

963
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,000
Sunday night. I was getting a tattoo cuz

964
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,360
I'm going through that midlife crisis. I

965
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,200
just turned 50. So is it Oz Oz full

966
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,640
name? My full the tattoo. Is it my full

967
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,159
name or just part of it? Oh, it's it's

968
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,679
it's Oz Daddy. Uh so um

969
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,080
so I was getting it and you know the

970
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,679
tattoo was about 6 hours and I was

971
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,000
clenching you know because of the pain

972
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,919
of the tattoo almost like planking for

973
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,480
that period of time. The next morning I

974
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,080
go uh to Miami to to film something for

975
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,799
Shark Tank and all of a sudden I feel a

976
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,039
pop like a little literally a pop two

977
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,840
inches over my belly button and I feel

978
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,320
and I could push it in and out. Ooh. And

979
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,399
I'm like, "Oh, I don't know." You know,

980
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,000
the next day I go home and I tell my

981
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,480
wife, I said, "You know, I have a little

982
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
pop here." She says, "Go to the doctor

983
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,520
right away." I said, "Nah, what are you

984
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,440
kidding me? I'm a man. I'm a big boy.

985
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,039
I'm not going to the doctor." Then she

986
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,960
says, "You better go to the doctor." So,

987
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,399
I go to the doctor. He says, I should

988
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,440
point out, by the way, nagging saves

989
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,640
lives. In point, it does. It does. In

990
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,640
point, it really does. Um, I go to my

991
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,559
doctor. He sends me over to NYU. He, you

992
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,640
know, you know, I' I've had him for 20

993
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,960
years and and I go in and uh a very um

994
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,120
very experienced uh doctor comes in,

995
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,279
looks at it, touches it for a second.

996
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,960
You need to go to surgery right now. He

997
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,120
says, "Have you had any problems

998
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,279
eating?" I said, "No, not at all." He

999
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,720
says, "Okay, well, that's a good thing."

1000
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,440
He said, "Did you take any aspirin

1001
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,279
lately or any blood thinners?" I said,

1002
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,200
"No." He said, "That's a good thing. We

1003
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,360
need to get you into surgery." Oh my

1004
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,799
goodness. So, you know, at that point,

1005
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,960
I'm like, "Why am I going to surgery?"

1006
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,159
He said, "Well, you know what we're

1007
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,279
looking at is probably a hernia and this

1008
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,519
little hole probably the the what you

1009
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,000
feel is like probably fat that came

1010
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,080
through and sooner or later your

1011
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,720
intestines are going to come through and

1012
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,640
we may have to cut your intestines." Oo.

1013
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,000
I called Robert. I said, "Robert, you

1014
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,440
know, fat came through." He was like,

1015
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,880
"And and my intestines didn't come

1016
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,120
through." And he said, "Robert from

1017
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,399
Shark Tank." He goes, "That's the reason

1018
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,799
for all your fat." I said, "Yeah, how

1019
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,080
compassionate. How compassion." Um, why

1020
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,000
would you call Robert of all people to

1021
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,519
get his advice? I don't know. Because

1022
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,559
he's just the happiest person on the

1023
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,799
planet. He is happy. And listen, then I

1024
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,640
go I'm in surgery about 4 hours later.

1025
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,080
Oh my goodness. Yeah. Can I show

1026
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,080
everybody what was going down? I I made

1027
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,440
a little animation. Come on up here. You

1028
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,880
You might enjoy this cuz you can help me

1029
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,720
narrate it. Come over this side. All

1030
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,760
right. So, let's pretend that this is

1031
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,000
you stand there. I'm going to

1032
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,760
demonstrate the why the abdominal wall

1033
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,440
gets weak and why when it gets weak it

1034
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,960
can pop through. Okay. So, let's lie on

1035
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,480
your back. Play the animation. Right.

1036
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,600
And when you lie on your back, right?

1037
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,240
Right. There's the belly button. Let's

1038
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,600
say just above it, you have areas of of

1039
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,039
the muscle that are pretty strong. And

1040
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,480
when you have a little hole there, a

1041
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,720
little bit of you from the inside can

1042
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,080
pop on the outside. Now, you can see in

1043
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
this person, there's got some intestines

1044
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,120
that are popping out. But this is

1045
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,640
freezes for a second. And with you, that

1046
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,480
bump was probably a little bit of fat.

1047
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,440
Even though Robert was joking, the first

1048
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,840
thing that comes out is a little bit of

1049
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,360
fat. That's the beginning of the hernia.

1050
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,039
As the hernia gets larger and larger,

1051
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,159
you get loops of bowel that'll come

1052
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,880
through. And here's the thing. If left

1053
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,000
untreated, yeah, you'll have, you know,

1054
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,360
green stuff going through there,

1055
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,600
intestines, but then eventually it'll

1056
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,000
turn black because it's being suffocated

1057
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,240
because this hernia is strangling the

1058
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,080
intestines down below. And when that

1059
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,080
tissue is strangled, if it were to fall

1060
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,320
back in on its own, it would release all

1061
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,159
that toxic stuff called major problem.

1062
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,039
Sepsis, even death happens. I mean, I've

1063
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,399
taken care of a lot of people with

1064
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,760
hernas. Yeah. Because before you become

1065
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,440
a heart surgeon, you got to do hernia

1066
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,600
surgery. I've seen people really get

1067
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,320
sick from these things. So, I am proud

1068
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,000
of you for intervening on yourself and

1069
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,799
listening to your wife nag you. Thank

1070
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,080
you. Absolutely. Yeah. Because at first

1071
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,600
you feel like, you know what, it'll go

1072
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,919
away. It's a little bump. You know, you

1073
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,279
get you get things around you, but then

1074
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,200
you know obviously the way they rolled

1075
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,200
me right in, they they obviously felt it

1076
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,720
was something serious. So, do you think

1077
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,240
that you're more sensitive to taking

1078
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,320
care of yourself because of your thyroid

1079
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,879
scare? Absolutely. because all I talk

1080
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,119
about now is early detection because uh

1081
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,720
you know I would have just been buying

1082
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,879
time and after this it would have been

1083
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,560
much much worse. You know it's it's only

1084
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,480
now been about 5 weeks since um I'm I'm

1085
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,320
better than ever now. I feel like I can

1086
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,159
go out and do everything. But you know I

1087
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,359
would have normally ignored that 5 years

1088
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,879
ago I would have said nah I'll wait till

1089
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,399
uh you know I'm I I'm curled over and I

1090
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,159
got to go to the doctor. Barely holding

1091
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,919
on. Absolutely. All right. When we come

1092
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,760
back, we got the three warning signs

1093
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,280
that you need to know to catch a hernia

1094
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,800
early, just like Damon did. Got to get

1095
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,280
it before it gets out of hand. Stay with

1096
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:49,200
us.

1097
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:51,919
[Applause]

1098
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,839
We are a nation riddled with allergies,

1099
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,440
but what if you outgrew them and didn't

1100
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,440
know it? People are walking around

1101
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,280
thinking they have this allergy and they

1102
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,359
no longer have it. We're doing a big

1103
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,839
allergy experiment

1104
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,000
that's coming up on Wednesday.

1105
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,119
I got a call from my man who was like,

1106
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,119
"Hey yo, son, let me find out somebody

1107
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,640
sold you a deadly bagel. Give me the

1108
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,320
number to the dude who sold you the

1109
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,760
deadly bagel." You know what I'm saying?

1110
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,520
I was like, "No, nobody sold me a deadly

1111
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,119
bagel." "Oh, now you want to protect

1112
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,560
your man who's selling you deadly

1113
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,359
bagels." "Well, check this out. I'mma

1114
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,640
find your man regardless. Regardless.

1115
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,440
Love you, bro. Later." Click. I was

1116
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,920
like, "Uh,

1117
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,480
love you, too. Bye."

1118
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,640
Look at you. Yeah, John got that call

1119
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,920
from a very confused friend who who saw

1120
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,640
that he was rushed to the hospital right

1121
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,000
after he posted a picture of a bagel. I

1122
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,200
was saying, you know, life is funny. One

1123
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,560
minute you're eating a bagel, the next

1124
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,440
minute you're in the hospital. My friend

1125
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,040
thought somebody sold me a deadly bagel.

1126
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,880
You know, that's how social media is.

1127
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,480
You got to love social media here. All

1128
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,320
right, so here's the deal. It wasn't a

1129
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,079
deadly bagel that caused David's hernia,

1130
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,680
but there are warning signs to look for

1131
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,800
so you can catch a hernia. Remember, a

1132
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,400
million of you going to have a procedure

1133
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,800
for this this year. It's common. Number

1134
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,240
one, there could be a bulge that looks

1135
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,280
like this. Look at look at the picture

1136
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,440
carefully. See, it looks pretty

1137
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,280
innocuous. Smooth bulge. If you catch it

1138
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,520
at this stage, you can get it before it

1139
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,640
gets out of hand like Damon did. Look

1140
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,040
familiar. Much bigger, but yes, that

1141
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,160
that that's it. Yeah. So, it's it's

1142
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,079
different. It's not what you normally

1143
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,040
look like. And it's not symmetrical.

1144
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,800
It's not like you put a little weight

1145
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,800
on, right? Number two, you could have

1146
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,280
severe digestion issues like

1147
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,480
constipation, nausea, or vomiting. Did

1148
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,920
you I didn't have any of that. None of

1149
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,359
that. Yeah. Remember I showed that

1150
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,680
intestine getting pulled through. Yeah.

1151
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,440
So if that gets strangulated, suffocated

1152
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,640
that gets squeezed at the base, then you

1153
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,839
don't have all those symptoms at once

1154
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,960
because your body's travel through.

1155
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,880
Yeah. Food can't go through there. And

1156
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,720
your body's immediate response is stop

1157
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,560
eating and get out whatever's in there

1158
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,680
cuz we're in a panic mode, right? So So

1159
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,440
you didn't have any of that. That's a

1160
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,440
good sign. Thank God. And number three,

1161
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,680
a sudden onset pain like the world's

1162
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,079
worst gas pain that makes you clutch

1163
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,200
your belly like this. I had a little bit

1164
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,599
of that. Yeah. How would you describe

1165
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,040
the pain specifically? A pinch. And it's

1166
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,200
it was a a pin like right here. Just a a

1167
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,960
strong pinch and I kept going, "What is

1168
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,800
that? What is that?" All cuz of that

1169
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,280
darn tattoo. Yeah, that's right. Did you

1170
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,839
finish the tattoo yet? No, it's not. I'm

1171
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,880
going I'm going to leave it undone.

1172
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,440
I don't know if I want to get any more

1173
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,960
tattoos. Let's do that. All right. So,

1174
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,720
here's the deal. Because their hernia

1175
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,560
can poke through when someone's

1176
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,000
abdominal wall is weakened, we want

1177
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,359
everyone who's worried about hernas to

1178
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,640
strengthen their abdominal wall. So,

1179
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,320
come on over here. We're gonna do a

1180
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,839
little game here. Kate CVY is here from

1181
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,640
Symphony Yoga. She's agreed to come and

1182
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,240
show everyone watching some yoga moves.

1183
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,839
So, okay, go ahead. If you don't mind,

1184
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,359
show us two simple yoga moves that

1185
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,119
everyone can do now to strengthen their

1186
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,640
belly, their core. Okay. It's good to

1187
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,480
prevent hernas, but it's also good to

1188
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,160
keep strong. All right. And then after

1189
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,400
we're done, Darren, we're going to

1190
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,839
exchange your health advice for some

1191
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,359
business advice from the pro here. We're

1192
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,440
going to shark tank it. That sounds

1193
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,440
great. Big fan of the show. Thank you.

1194
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,160
I'm ready. All right. Great. So, some

1195
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,800
simple leg raises that you can do is lie

1196
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,280
on your back all the way down and then

1197
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,440
you're going to inhale as you raise your

1198
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,040
left leg to start. You keep your belly

1199
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,680
firm the whole time. Yep. And you engage

1200
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,160
the core so you feel it engage and then

1201
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,640
keep going slowly up. You got a 12-pack

1202
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,280
in there, by the way. Very impressed. I

1203
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,040
wish. That'd be great. And then and then

1204
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,480
you start on the right leg. So, you do

1205
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,160
alternating. So, do this while you're

1206
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,200
watching commercials, what whatever you

1207
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,960
want to do, but it's not long. You can

1208
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,800
do about about 10 on each side. Exactly.

1209
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,000
As long as you don't feel pain. So don't

1210
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,280
like raise your leg too much so you

1211
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,640
don't feel like So simple leg raise. The

1212
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,560
next thing is a shoulder stand, but this

1213
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,079
is a half shoulder stand. Exactly. So

1214
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,320
you just bring your legs all the way up

1215
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,760
and you use your hands to support your

1216
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,640
low back and then you if it's too much

1217
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,520
on your leg to support you just bring

1218
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,359
your legs lower down slowly. That makes

1219
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
it easier or harder? Makes it easier.

1220
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,200
All right. But the the hard version is

1221
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,560
way up and that's the abdomen. Yeah.

1222
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,839
Right. But you got to hold your legs up

1223
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,359
because your legs they they would be

1224
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,599
tense before. Right. Exactly. All right.

1225
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,920
Now, hop up now. Now, you beautifully

1226
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,760
taught D a few things. So, business

1227
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,240
advice. What's the pitch? You just

1228
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,280
opened a a spot in Jersey called Yoga

1229
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,560
Symphony, right? Exactly. Exactly. Build

1230
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,800
your audience. So, take it away. Yes.

1231
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,400
So, my my question would be, how do I

1232
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,839
gain more corporate clients because

1233
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,480
there's so many companies out there that

1234
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,680
are attracting corporations for yoga?

1235
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,280
So, I just wanted to see how I could

1236
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,960
direct differentiate myself. Well, if

1237
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,720
you have people locally, how how are you

1238
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,640
giving it a giving them an offer they

1239
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,800
can't refuse? Meaning, you know, giving

1240
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,560
free classes for x amount of time. If

1241
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,320
they like it, they'll convert, right?

1242
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,680
And then no matter what brand or product

1243
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,359
you have, social media is the easiest

1244
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,560
and the cheapest. But you got to look at

1245
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,400
social media as a half an hour

1246
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,160
television show. If your favorite half

1247
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,200
an hour television show, 28 minutes is

1248
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,720
commercials, then you're going to switch

1249
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,160
your channel. So, what you need to do is

1250
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,240
give them as much information you can

1251
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,000
for the 28 minutes on your social media.

1252
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,000
So, the two minutes that you're offering

1253
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,680
something for them to buy, then you do.

1254
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,720
So too many people on social media just

1255
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,480
go sell sell buy help me out instead

1256
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,400
just give them information so this the

1257
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,520
smartest person the water cooler on

1258
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,040
Monday morning and then when they're

1259
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,880
ready to buy they come to you. So those

1260
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,480
are those

1261
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,760
advice and more importantly I love you

1262
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,119
and I'm glad you're doing well. Thank

1263
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,760
you Doug. Thank you. God bless you my

1264
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,160
friend. All right last on Shark Tank.

1265
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,160
We'll be right back.

1266
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,079
A trail of unsolved murders in

1267
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,960
California taunting police with letters.

1268
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,200
Now 50 years later, can DNA evidence

1269
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,079
track down the Zodiac Killer? People

1270
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,040
think this is the guy. All new Oz.

1271
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,040
That's coming up tomorrow.

1272
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,560
For years, I've been telling you that it

1273
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,720
is natural and that everyone does it.

1274
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,960
And sometimes it's by action, sometimes

1275
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,079
it's on purpose. You got loud ones and

1276
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,720
silent ones, smelly or not. Talking

1277
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,599
about flatulence, of course. And one man

1278
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,200
is saying he was fired for doing it at

1279
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,760
work.

1280
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,440
Get this. Paul Flart was working as a

1281
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,599
security guard when he decided to

1282
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,800
document all of his work farts on video

1283
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:59,599
and post them online. He said it was a

1284
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,079
breeze

1285
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,839
and he got away with it for six months

1286
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,800
until the bosses found out. So, take a

1287
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,800
look.

1288
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:12,380
[Music]

1289
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,560
Why are you recording? Because take it

1290
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,000
off. No, sir. Yes, sir. You're not going

1291
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,119
to record me wearing that uniform? I'm

1292
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,680
not recording you, sir. I'm recording

1293
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,960
me, sir. Okay, you turn it off. Okay.

1294
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,760
Well, sir, you're firing me anyway,

1295
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,960
right? Yes, I am. We are joined today by

1296
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,200
the man who goes by the name Paul Flart.

1297
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,960
What made you post videos of your

1298
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,440
workwind, if I can call it that, for six

1299
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,720
months? First off, how you guys doing?

1300
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,560
Thanks for having me here. I appreciate

1301
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,079
it so much. But, uh, you know, I just

1302
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,400
one day I farted in the lobby of the

1303
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,599
hospital and, uh, the acoustics were

1304
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,680
just so great that I had to share it

1305
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,359
with my friends. We brainstormed about

1306
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,800
it for a bit. They loved it. Felt like

1307
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,480
the world needed to see it. So, we came

1308
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,720
up with Paul Flart, made the Instagram

1309
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,200
account, and then the rest, as you know,

1310
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,200
is history. So, we saw that video of you

1311
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,880
getting fired. Uh, you're still out of

1312
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,560
work, right? That's what I believe.

1313
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,960
Yeah. And you're pursuing your dream of

1314
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,160
being an athome online gamer where I got

1315
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,160
to say you're going to get far fewer

1316
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,599
complaints there. So, it might be a good

1317
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,920
position. But, but we spoke to uh the

1318
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,000
online performers group. Uh one of the

1319
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,680
largest talent management firms for pro

1320
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
gamers and they actually want to do an

1321
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,400
interview with you to give you some as

1322
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,720
they said it career advice and even

1323
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,800
discuss possible representation. How's

1324
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,800
that sound? That sounds amazing.

1325
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Awesome.

1326
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,440
Yeah, I was not expecting that. Awesome.

1327
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,960
Well, I I hope you enjoy your time with

1328
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,960
them. Thank you for joining us, Paul.

1329
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,400
You're an everyday hero in a whole

1330
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,319
different way. Together, everybody,

1331
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,370
change is happening. Our journey is just

1332
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:49,480
beginning.

1333
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:49,480
