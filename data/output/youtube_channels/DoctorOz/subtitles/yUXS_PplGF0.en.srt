14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,320
Hey,

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,239
how are you? Oh my goodness, you look

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,600
well. Good to see you again. Good to see

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,280
you as well. Thank you for joining me

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,640
again. The last time you were

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,320
here, you weren't married, didn't have a

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,399
baby. I mean, life's changed for you.

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,239
Yes. It was so funny watching that clip,

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,640
I couldn't get those words out. I was so

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,640
excited but nervous because I was so

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
early on and I didn't want to say and it

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,800
was like I was put on the spot. I was

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,079
like, "Do I say? Do I say?" And it was I

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,359
had to put it out there. Are you

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,280
enjoying your new reality with a little

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,439
baby girl? Oh my god, I'm in heaven.

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,320
She's so precious. She's so precious and

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,920
has like this little angel face and

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,159
she's my whole world. You speak about

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,159
angels, but you came close to becoming

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,520
one. Uh, yes. So, let's talk a little

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,520
about that. So, your feet start getting

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,799
swollen. That's your image. Yes. Right.

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,640
You gained 17 pounds in one week. In one

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,159
week. And what was the diagnosis?

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,960
Preeacclampsia.

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,520
Have you all heard of that?

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,880
Preeacclampsia. Good. We We know the

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,400
name. We don't know the symptoms. That

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,040
rapid weight gain, uh, protein in urine.

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,119
Yep. And high blood pressure. Were you

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,520
scared? I was I was scared. It's a

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,840
leading cause probably of of moms dying

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,880
giving birth to babies. It is. And I

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,439
think that I was just not in my right

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,360
mind. And I just thought, you know, is

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,000
this really real? Do I really have this

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,479
condition? I don't understand what's

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,680
happening to me. Um I could could have

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,040
gone into seizures. Um so many things

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,159
can happen. Come on up. I want to show

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,759
everybody what actually happened. This

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,319
is why it's dangerous for mom and and

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,679
for the child. Sure. So this is a simple

58
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,959
way of looking at it. So for the mom,

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,360
the big issues are high blood pressure,

60
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,560
which you had stroke because of the high

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
blood pressure because you burst the

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,200
blood vessels in your brain. You can go

63
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,959
to kidney failure, which is what the

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,400
protein in the urine is all about. when

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
the kidneys can't hold on the protein,

66
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,120
they're failing. They're starting to pop

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,720
the little blood vessels in there and

68
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,840
leak out the protein and eventually

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,360
heart failure because your heart can't

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
keep up. Yeah. But the other part of the

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,000
equation is even if you can save mom for

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,400
babies, they're born prematurely often

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,840
times. Uh they can not grow normally

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,599
because they're were born early and they

75
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,200
may have been sick during the pregnancy.

76
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
And unfortunately, we lose a lot of

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,680
kids. And this is a big problem that I

78
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,959
want to touch on. It's one of the

79
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,680
reasons I'm so happy you came today.

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,920
Yeah. Because it's it's a reality of

81
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,440
moms in America. It's we're not where we

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,519
need to be. But let me finish your story

83
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,879
first. 12 hours after you're diagnosed

84
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,800
with preeacclampsia, 12 hours. Well,

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,239
yeah. They kept monitoring me and I

86
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,480
noticed, you know, I'm not a doctor, but

87
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,360
I noticed the numbers were going upward.

88
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,200
You know, it was 145 over 90. Then it

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,599
was 150 over 100, and it was and um my

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,920
doctor said, "Okay, get your bag. We're

91
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,200
going to deliver

92
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,120
today." And my husband wasn't in town. I

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,040
was home

94
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,560
alone. Uh, and I just started crying.

95
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,080
So, how'd you deal with that? I mean,

96
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,760
again, it's by yourself. Your life's at

97
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
risk. Your baby's life at risk. You

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,239
worked so hard to get here. I just

99
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
wanted her to be Well, at that point, I

100
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,799
didn't know it was if it was a boy or

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,040
girl, but I just wanted her to be

102
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:43,680
healthy and um I just wanted to deliver

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,239
a healthy baby. It was um Sorry. Sorry.

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,599
It was

105
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,480
just I didn't want to think about what

106
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,239
could have happened. I prayed and I

107
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,959
called my aunt and she came to get me

108
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,959
and we went to the hospital and he made

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,680
it in time and um then it was another

110
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,879
part of the drama in the hospital in the

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,159
delivery room. Um they gave me an

112
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,080
epidural. My husband was right by my

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,000
side. was holding my hand and you know

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,959
they put that sheet up where you can't

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,160
really see what's going on and I

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,759
remember the tugging the pulling I could

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,560
hear everything that was going on but at

118
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,960
some point I woke up

119
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,800
and I tried to talk to them but no one

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,800
could hear me no one was responding and

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,000
I was trying to force myself to yell

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,320
like hey can you hear me hello and no

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,040
one was responding and I thought you

124
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,600
know what I'm I died I didn't make it I

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,720
I felt like I was dead. Out of body

126
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,120
experience. It was because I knew I had

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,520
an epidural. In an epidural, you're

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,720
awake the entire time. So when I came to

129
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,720
eventually, I was able to speak and

130
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,440
people

131
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,240
responded and I was told that the

132
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,080
operation lasted for over three hours.

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,080
Oh my goodness. It was a 20 25 minute,

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,000
you know, operation, a C-section, a

135
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,120
cacaian, and they could not get the baby

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,440
out. They cut me. My doctor was cutting

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,840
through my uterus, and she said it was

138
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,680
so thick. She just kept cutting and

139
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,240
cutting and she could not reach the

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,320
baby. I had fibroids, which is why I'm

141
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,039
in this situation, you know, to begin

142
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,880
with. I had myomectomies and so I had

143
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,800
scar tissue. I still had fibroids and I

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,199
didn't want a blood transfusion and I

145
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,720
was bleeding out. So at some point um my

146
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:44,800
doctor Dr. um Melinda Millard Thrasher

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,720
decided that okay we're losing her too

148
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
much blood loss. We can't give her a

149
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,440
blood transfusion. We can't get to the

150
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,280
baby. So she not only cut me um

151
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,960
horizontally but then she had to cut me

152
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,919
vertically as well just to get the baby

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,560
up. And she said out of 20ome years of

154
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:04,639
her practicing, I was only the fifth

155
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,639
person that she ever had to cut twice.

156
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,080
It's a miracle you're alive. It's a

157
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,479
miracle I'm alive and my baby's

158
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,440
alive. Yeah. Oh, I have no idea. Yeah.

159
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,720
And my hemoglobins were so low and they

160
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,960
were so worried, but here I am. That's a

161
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,800
lot. It's a lot. A lot of risks all at

162
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,000
once. I know. All right. So you survive

163
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,000
something for all intents and purposes

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
you shouldn't have. Mhm. And if you're

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
going to be a miracle, you must be a

166
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,840
purpose to it. Yes. There are a lot of

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,039
women who are going to go through what

168
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,720
you went through. This country

169
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,800
unfortunately has a public health crisis

170
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
in preeacclampsia. Mhm. And despite

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
spending more money on healthcare than

172
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,440
any other country, our maternity care,

173
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,120
taking care of moms, is bad. It's worse

174
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,960
at preventing basic things, including

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,960
saving lives like yours were saved than

176
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,039
a lot of other developed nations. So I

177
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,960
can talk about this till the cows come

178
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,280
home. But when people like you tell

179
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,720
their personal story and folks at home

180
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,400
see themselves in you, that's what makes

181
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,840
a difference. Good. So God bless you for

182
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,160
sharing with us. I hope I can make a

183
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,400
difference. You are. Three weeks after

184
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,319
Kenya gave birth, she posted this photo.

185
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Believe it or not, this photo which uh I

186
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,400
mean it's fantastic image, but it

187
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,880
unleashed an uproar about her quick

188
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,479
recovery on the internet. And there a

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,000
lot of concerns about what the heck was

190
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,319
going on. Find the truth behind these

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,080
photos. When we come back, we're back

192
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,680
with our Aussie exclusive with former

193
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
Atlanta housewife Kenya Moore, who is

194
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,800
speaking out about her frightening

195
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,880
pregnancy scare. I mean, as a doctor, I

196
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
know the real risks you survived. You

197
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,240
probably because you were there

198
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,039
understand them now. But between

199
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
bleeding out, three-hour plus operation,

200
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,400
waking up, maybe having crossed over in

201
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
the middle of the surgery. Yes. All that

202
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,479
happens and finally they put this little

203
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,120
beautiful baby in your arms. What did

204
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,599
that feel like? Oh, when we saw her,

205
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,039
they lifted her up and they said it was

206
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:56,479
a girl and she started whailing. She was

207
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,360
crying so hard and they they handed her

208
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,639
to us and skin-to-skin contact and she

209
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,440
was so tiny. She was only 5 lbs. And how

210
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,360
premature was she? Uh 5 and 1/2 weeks.

211
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,240
Yeah. And we they put her on my chest

212
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,160
and I just I just started crying so

213
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,680
hard. I saw the big spread in People

214
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,319
magazine. How's Little Brooklyn doing

215
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,280
now? She is fantastic. She's lifting her

216
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,520
head. She makes all these

217
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,680
faces. Um I think she's a little

218
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,400
advanced. Like she's doing things that a

219
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,319
little a little baby that's only uh five

220
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,759
weeks shouldn't be doing. Good for her.

221
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,800
Yeah. She's probably just should coming

222
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,200
out just about now probably. Exactly. So

223
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
you posted this picture. Mhm. And a lot

224
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,320
of folks looked at that and said it's

225
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,479
impossible. It raised doubts about what

226
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
had really gone on. You can't tell from

227
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,320
this picture that you had almost died.

228
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah. Yeah. Did you had a huge belly,

229
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,240
swollen feet? How much weight did you

230
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,760
gain during the pregnancy? I gained 75

231
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,519
lbs.

232
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,720
Yeah. And you that that's just a few

233
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,040
weeks later as your feet that were

234
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,120
swollen. Yeah. You know, a lot of it to

235
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,320
be honest because of the preeacclimsia

236
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,200
was water weight gain. So, a week after

237
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,600
I had given birth, I lost like 40 lbs.

238
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,279
But I had a um a C-section. So, I

239
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
couldn't really stand up. I obviously

240
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,200
couldn't work out or do anything like

241
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:17,440
that. But I was a workout person before.

242
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,360
I took care of my body and um I what we

243
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,360
call it just snapped back after like 2

244
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,800
weeks. I thought, "Wow, my my tummy is

245
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,279
flat again, you know, well, nearly

246
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,320
flat." And I didn't think that would

247
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,240
happen. I'm 47 years old, so I was

248
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
worried, too. Like, okay, the young

249
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,399
girls get the snapback, but what about

250
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,680
me?

251
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,839
And um so you take care of your body,

252
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,480
you eat well. But what are you eating?

253
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,760
Um I eat a lot of fruit. I drink a lot

254
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,240
of water. A lot of water. Um vegetables.

255
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,519
I'm really a pescatarian, so I I eat a

256
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,880
lot of fish. Um sushi, things like that.

257
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,800
Well, the fruit plate you posted was

258
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,160
beautiful. Oh, thank you. So, I gota ask

259
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,120
one question for all the Housewife fans

260
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,720
out there, and there quite a few of

261
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,560
them. Yes. You know, so you're not on

262
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,760
this coming season of Real Housewives of

263
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,399
Atlanta. I don't know how I could have

264
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,200
done it with a baby. There's no way. So,

265
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,440
are you back next year? I say never say

266
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,880
never. Never say never. That sounds like

267
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,279
a It sounds like you might be pregnant

268
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,640
again. I think she's pregnant and she's

269
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,880
coming back. Oh, that would be a

270
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,000
blessing. I love having you on. I love

271
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,600
being here. And thanks for telling the

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,720
story. I know that it's emotional, but

273
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,560
you're going to help a lot of people. I

274
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
hope so. God bless you. All right. Thank
