00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,439
Dr. Austin Leaks, welcome to Miami and

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,560
welcome to Biohawk Kids.

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,000
>> Yeah, thanks for having me.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,279
>> I'm really excited to sit down with you

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,759
since we chatted in London.

6
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,280
>> Yep.

7
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,120
>> You brought up something when we had

8
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,719
dinner together about how people are

9
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,400
constantly chasing symptoms.

10
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,560
>> Well, yeah, it's easy to do when you

11
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,560
have a lot of symptoms going on and a

12
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,160
lot of unknown reasons as to why they're

13
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,880
happening. I think you can start chasing

14
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,160
your tail pretty quickly and uh it takes

15
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,600
a lot of work to figure out what's going

16
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,279
on. It's kind of like being an

17
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,199
investigative analyst like you have to

18
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,560
really dive deep and oftentimes we don't

19
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,880
have the time or the resources to do

20
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,880
that.

21
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,559
>> And when it means like in my opinion

22
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,160
sometimes people do you think they just

23
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,000
kind of come up with symptoms as well

24
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,440
because something else is going on

25
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,360
they're projecting other areas of their

26
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,559
life. Is it almost like avoiding things

27
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,000
that are unhealed?

28
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,719
>> Yeah, that's a really good question. I

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,039
think um you know much like when you get

30
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,200
sick I think you start having you know

31
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,520
you feel malaise you feel fatigued you

32
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,280
have runny nose like you just overall

33
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,039
don't feel very well and it's it starts

34
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,440
creating this dysfunction within your

35
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,039
system to where um it's easy to become

36
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,440
like a hypochondriact about what's going

37
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,199
on because when you're aware of what's

38
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,560
what your body is trying to tell you

39
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,240
start trying to figure it out on your

40
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,320
own and so every little thing becomes a

41
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,760
potential problem when the reality is

42
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,040
sometimes it's just part of living in

43
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
this world and other times there it

44
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
really is an actual issue.

45
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,479
>> For anybody listening, why do you think

46
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,680
conventional medicine fails so many

47
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,479
people every single year?

48
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,600
>> Well, it's kind of like what I was

49
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,880
saying before, like it takes a lot of

50
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,640
effort and time to figure these things

51
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,799
out. And also, we have a system that

52
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,880
profits off the sick. Um, whenever

53
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,479
you're rewarding people for not helping

54
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,200
people to get better to their full

55
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,320
capability, um, you're going to create a

56
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
system that is very toxic. And um I

57
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,520
think we're seeing the full effect of

58
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
that now with our you know the fact that

59
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
we spend the most amount of money in the

60
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,400
world on healthcare and we have one of

61
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,000
the sickest

62
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,360
>> developed nations in the world like

63
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
there's there's your evidence.

64
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,040
>> I you know I always look at other

65
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,560
countries that are you know kind of

66
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,920
spend on healthcare and stuff and I was

67
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,000
like why are they doing better than us?

68
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,000
Like is it do you think it's just down

69
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to the fact that pharmaceutical industry

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,799
is so intertwined in our government and

71
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,600
it's become so corrupt or do you think

72
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,759
it's across the board from agriculture

73
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,520
to how we're training people in medical

74
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,400
schools and turning out doctors these

75
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,959
days? Like where do you see the largest

76
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,599
piece of the problem? I think the

77
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,800
largest piece is going to stem from our

78
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,280
beliefs as a culture that we can put all

79
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,440
our trust or all our eggs in the basket

80
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,360
of conventional medicine thinking that

81
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,680
they can solve all our problems because

82
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,000
that's been the indoctrination since the

83
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,760
you know early 1900s is that you know

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,680
your doctor knows everything health

85
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,519
related and they don't. They're trained

86
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,040
in specific areas of health for sure and

87
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
are really good at it but they are not

88
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,920
the end- all beall when it comes to

89
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,080
health. And so our culture, especially

90
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,120
our grandparents and our parents, they

91
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
think there, you know, there's a pill

92
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,599
for every ill and that's all you really

93
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,599
have to do. You don't have to do any

94
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,519
actual work. But then that stems into,

95
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,280
yeah, agriculture stems into our

96
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,200
workforce. It stems into what happens in

97
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
the home and uh it creates a very

98
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,400
vicious cycle.

99
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,080
>> When we, you know, we were there for the

100
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,200
inauguration together and, you know, we

101
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,360
were so excited to bring in Bobby

102
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,080
Kennedy and I think they HHS has done

103
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,319
some amazing work. However, do you think

104
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,360
they're as far along currently to date

105
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,200
as we had maybe hoped or expected?

106
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120
>> I think probably not as far as we would

107
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
hoped. I I think it's realistically

108
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,159
though it's is probably as far as we

109
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,159
could have gotten to this point. There's

110
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,239
a lot of undoing that we have to to do

111
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,480
to kind of get at real progress. And

112
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,319
also understand that there's a lot of

113
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,680
there's a lot of temptations or active

114
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,280
threats going against uh Bobby Kennedy

115
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,840
and the whole organization because

116
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,760
there's a lot of money to be made. And I

117
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,599
think the advancements with technology

118
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,280
and AI is really uh something that we

119
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,519
probably don't fully understand the full

120
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
consequences of that yet. But it's

121
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,120
coming under the guise of like well this

122
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,799
is better for the health of the people

123
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,239
when the reality is it probably may lead

124
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
to more control.

125
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,000
>> I saw this little clip I think it was a

126
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,440
couple of weeks ago and it was President

127
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,239
Trump Bobby Kennedy who was obviously in

128
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,519
it Dr. draws and it was perhaps the CEO

129
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
of Fizer but definitely somebody from

130
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
from Fizer

131
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,959
>> and they were talking about like their

132
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,879
funding and what they're going to do

133
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,480
with it and I just stood back and I just

134
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,080
shook my head. I was like this is not

135
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,599
about giving you guys more funding. This

136
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,319
is about

137
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,400
>> looking deeper into what a lot of the

138
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,079
products that they have created. Not a

139
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
single product that has come out of

140
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
Fizer has led to a cure ever,

141
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,199
>> right?

142
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,560
>> And so for me that was that was a little

143
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,759
like disappointing almost because I was

144
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,120
like listen like we all know what's

145
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,280
going on here. But that's where I say

146
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,280
that the pharmaceutical companies have

147
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,720
such a power over our government because

148
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,759
of the amount of funding that they have

149
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
brought in that I don't think any

150
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,400
government these guys have definitely

151
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
done a much better job are completely

152
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
free of that. Well, again, I think if if

153
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,120
what they were doing was leading to

154
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
healthier nations and and populations,

155
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,800
then it's great, you know, but if it's

156
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,320
just about, hey, instead of uh getting

157
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,240
at the root cause of things, now we're

158
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,000
just going to create a new product with

159
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,400
a different angle that's going to help

160
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,520
you, you know, treat the symptom and not

161
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
actually fix a problem. It's like, well,

162
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,400
we're just like, it's a revolving door

163
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,040
of what we've already been exposed to.

164
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,960
So, I'm hoping that we actually have a

165
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,479
true desire to heal people. But when you

166
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,919
look at people like the World Economic

167
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,600
Forum where they have a stated

168
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,880
depopulation agenda, I don't believe

169
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,360
that that's really what we're trying to

170
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
do.

171
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,320
>> Yeah. When you if you were like actively

172
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,440
part of HHS and you could work on

173
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,080
certain policies and stuff, what are

174
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,320
>> Boy,

175
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,680
>> what are three policies or things that

176
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,280
you would like to get funding for? And

177
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,080
what policies would you have liked to

178
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,680
put into place? Yeah, it' be uh policies

179
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,680
for having like microagg,

180
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,600
you know, exposed to the the things that

181
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,520
it is and have to have the preservatives

182
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,520
and all that stuff in it. Um, the other

183
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,520
one would be supporting the nuclear

184
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280
family so that we can have women if they

185
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,039
want to work like that's fantastic, but

186
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,199
allowing for more flexibility so they

187
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,919
can be at home with their new babies or

188
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,759
supporting their families and having um

189
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,240
roles for husbands to take on that where

190
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,320
they can make more money to buy good

191
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,400
healthy food. Like these are all very

192
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,880
like, you know, maybe not so practical,

193
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,000
but they also all are very practical at

194
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,520
the same time. It's like we want to have

195
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,120
a nuclear family. We want to have good

196
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,720
healthy food and we don't want to treat

197
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,479
our our homes like hotels. I think if we

198
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,319
can avoid that, we would start seeing a

199
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
lot more health in our nation.

200
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,120
>> You know, it's funny you talk about how

201
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,759
women should have more choice. I think

202
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,600
feminism was terrible. The first wave of

203
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,520
feminism where we were able to vote and

204
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,479
have our own bank account. Amazing

205
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,000
obviously. Okay.

206
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,680
>> But the second wave of feminism that

207
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,160
came in I think is completely been toxic

208
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,720
to the family system because it has

209
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,720
taken away traditional gender roles

210
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,639
which made us women stay in our feminine

211
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,160
and men in their masculine. And when I

212
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,440
look at America, because I'm I'm

213
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,039
obviously Pakistani, I spend a lot of

214
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,800
time in the Middle East as well. When I

215
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,960
look at America and what's happened to

216
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,880
the men in this country when it comes to

217
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,039
being providers and protectors, which at

218
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,160
the end of the day is the two main

219
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,800
purposes of being a man,

220
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
>> right?

221
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
>> If you're not alignment over there, then

222
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
what are you doing,

223
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,280
>> right? But so many stories I hear them

224
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,759
all day that people man in this country

225
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,319
are so disconnected from understanding

226
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,560
that that is your role and function to

227
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,120
provide safety and security to your

228
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,759
partner and to provide financially to

229
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,840
your partner.

230
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,160
>> Right. Well, I think again culturally

231
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,000
speaking, we've we've created this fear

232
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,759
at least what I've experienced as a as a

233
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
white male. It's like I feel bad for

234
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,400
being a white male who wants to protect

235
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,160
my wife. Like

236
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,919
>> why? because that's what we've been told

237
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
for since I was a kid that like this is

238
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,120
a toxic masculinity thing. The reality

239
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,479
is uh and what I've realized now that I

240
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,639
have four kids and been married for 12

241
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:40,080
years um being a a male is is hard and

242
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,919
if anything it's uh it's a lot of

243
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,160
responsibility, right? It's it's it's

244
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,440
not that I get to abuse my leadership.

245
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
It's if anything, if I'm going to be a

246
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,199
good leader, it means that I have to die

247
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,120
to myself. I have to sacrifice. I have

248
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
to give up what I what I want to do for

249
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,919
my for the for the benefit of my kids

250
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,080
and my wife. And so I think um there's a

251
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,840
picture of like true masculinity from

252
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,680
like a biblical perspective that doesn't

253
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,599
align with what our culture says

254
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,000
masculinity is. So that's part of the

255
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,120
problem.

256
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
>> You know, I wouldn't even look at it

257
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,720
like that and I'll I'll pose this to you

258
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,800
and you tell me what you think. I think

259
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,479
it's not even giving up what we want,

260
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,960
but it's repositioning the narrative

261
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,280
because a woman also adds so much

262
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,879
structure and and and a woman's energy

263
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,840
is naturally a manifestation, right? So,

264
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,560
she creates that structure at home and

265
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,840
brings in that creativity for and tells

266
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,199
a man, I'm going to give you peace in

267
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,639
the house so that you can go out into

268
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,720
the world and create and you can go out

269
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,320
into the world and bring home abundance

270
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,159
for us because I'm providing you that

271
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
safety as well. It's almost like an

272
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,880
energetic exchange

273
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,560
>> in some ways and and women are I I think

274
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,519
choosing the right partner is very very

275
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,680
important.

276
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,200
>> Um but I think that again needs to be

277
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,240
shifted as a narrative is like instead

278
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,839
of making men feel like they're

279
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,760
sacrificing

280
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,279
it's that together planning so the man

281
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,120
still feels supported as well but

282
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,800
understands the woman's also taking on a

283
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,560
lot of responsibility especially in this

284
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,920
country where child care is next to

285
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,120
impossible for a lot of people. Right.

286
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,040
>> Very expensive. No, I think that's such

287
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,440
a like I think about my wife and I like

288
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,120
most of my business success is I mean

289
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,360
almost all of it has been because of her

290
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,200
like she is she like she stays home with

291
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,399
our kids by design like she wants to

292
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,640
like that was what we discussed before

293
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,080
we even had kids when she worked um at

294
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,279
different points when our early in our

295
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
marriage before we had kids and she

296
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,279
actually provided most of the financial

297
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,519
income when I was in school because she

298
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,839
had to and but when we were first

299
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,200
married um I told her I was like look we

300
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,480
want to have kids like you want to stay

301
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,399
at home even though you could go out and

302
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,320
do anything that you wanted to and So we

303
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,640
took a financial hit up front, you know,

304
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,959
to to for me to have one income.

305
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,320
>> But by us doing that, she pro yeah, she

306
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,640
provided that peace and stability within

307
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,399
our home to where we would have amazing

308
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,920
meals. Like we would have a peaceful

309
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,120
environment. Like our house would be

310
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,720
very maintained. We'd have a lot of

311
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,800
guests come over. We would like host a

312
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,399
lot of people. And you know, since we've

313
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,640
had kids, it's just kind of continued.

314
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,800
So I I 100% agree with you. Like that is

315
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,800
an energetic exchange that if it wasn't

316
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
for her or wasn't for me working

317
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,120
together, it wouldn't have happened.

318
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,959
>> Yeah. And I don't think you can almost

319
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,040
put a price tag on that sort of a

320
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,800
beautiful harmony between the two,

321
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,760
right? And I think when we look across

322
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,519
the world in any cultures, I think both

323
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,399
people understanding their roles and

324
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,160
understanding what they're bringing to

325
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,160
the table improves their health,

326
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,760
improves the community that they're part

327
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,519
of. And I think that's where we've gone

328
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,399
wrong in this country is we've become so

329
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,200
disconnected from understanding our own

330
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,880
personal identities. And that's where I

331
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,440
think a lot of women are also women are

332
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,560
30% more susceptible to autoimmune

333
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,320
disease. But I think also women are

334
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,079
living out of design. Women are

335
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,519
chronically stressed. We're pushing

336
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,040
ourselves to do things that we're not

337
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,120
necessarily designed to do. And we're

338
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,959
constantly like we we we our cortisol

339
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,480
levels are unwired. Well, that's I mean

340
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,000
I always I've always said, you know,

341
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,800
when you look at things like PCOS and

342
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,880
indenturosis and and really what you're

343
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,560
seeing is the reversal of the benefits

344
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,959
of female hormones. You're switching

345
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,120
from like, you know, femininity to

346
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,959
masculinity by design because like you

347
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,560
you have to that's a cortisol response.

348
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,480
And so I think whenever I'm working with

349
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,920
a female client, it's always I'm always

350
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
trying to portray that to them and help

351
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,880
them to analyze areas of their life

352
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
where where that's not happening where

353
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,560
it's like where are you adding extra

354
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,480
cortisol or extra stress unnecessarily

355
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,839
sometimes and sometimes because you have

356
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,440
to like you know there's just certain

357
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,640
things you have to do but more times

358
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,040
than not when you have this culture

359
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,880
that's saying like do more do more and

360
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,320
you start getting less and less like you

361
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,079
have to understand the connection

362
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,240
hormonally as to why that's happening.

363
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,839
And that's that's the whole point. If

364
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,440
you are taking protein powder, you

365
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,720
definitely need to hear this. The Clean

366
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,320
Label Project tested 160 different

367
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,440
proteins from different vendors and

368
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,120
brands across the US. And you're going

369
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,000
to be shocked at the discovery that they

370
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,240
made. Nearly half of the top selling

371
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,399
proteins in the US tested high for lead.

372
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,320
And if you're somebody who consumes

373
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,160
protein powders daily, this is something

374
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,720
you have to be concerned about. And to

375
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,120
make matters worse, most brands do not

376
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,320
value transparency and will not reveal

377
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,640
their test data online. And I want my

378
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,640
community like myself to always make an

379
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,200
informed choice of what they want to be

380
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,440
exposed to and how they consume their

381
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,440
daily protein. And that is why I love

382
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,279
Pure. I also sat down with the founder

383
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,200
and had a full honest transparent

384
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,279
conversation with him about how they

385
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,519
source, how they educate their consumer,

386
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,440
and also what their products offer on

387
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,480
the market, which sets them apart. Their

388
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,920
Pure PW1 protein tastes absolutely

389
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,000
exceptional and you know you're not

390
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,839
getting the gunk of heavy metals in it

391
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,360
to start your morning with. And that is

392
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,120
why I absolutely love Pur's PW1 whey

393
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,120
protein and that is how I choose to

394
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,440
start my day every morning. Every single

395
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,200
batch is third party tested by the Clean

396
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,240
Label Project and no product is ever

397
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,880
sold unless it passes these tests. NPU

398
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,800
is one of the only brands in the US that

399
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,880
has the clean label product

400
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,040
certification on their products. And

401
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,519
that is only possible because they make

402
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,440
all their third party testing completely

403
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,600
transparently available to the consumer

404
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
through a QR code where you can track

405
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,959
the exact journey of the batch of

406
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,440
product that you're purchasing. So you

407
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,920
guys can see for yourself exactly how

408
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,079
clean the PW1 that you're consuming in

409
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,839
the morning is. Every single serving

410
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,639
gives you 21 g of minimally processed,

411
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,720
high quality bioavailable protein. It

412
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,920
comes from pasture-raised

413
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,760
cows, no GMOs, no hormones, no

414
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,079
herbicides, no pesticides, and

415
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,399
definitely no heavy metals. So, this

416
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,800
means I can start my day with confidence

417
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,120
knowing I'm having something super clean

418
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
to support my skeletal muscle mass. My

419
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,680
personal favorite flavor is a Berber and

420
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,079
vanilla. no artificial flavors and no

421
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,480
funky aftertaste. So, make sure your

422
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,000
daily protein powder is not hiding any

423
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
nasty chemicals and they're not being

424
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,360
open and transparent with you. So, if

425
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
you want something clean, delicious, and

426
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,800

can thank me later. when you are working

431
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,240
with your female clients, right? What

432
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,480
are the three things you tell them to

433
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,399
optimize their hormones before they turn

434
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,920
to something like um hormone replacement

435
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,680
therapy, which we're going to get into?

436
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,360
>> Yeah. Uh it's always going to be

437
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,720
circadian rhythm first of all.

438
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
>> And so what is that? Let's explain to

439
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,480
the audience.

440
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,800
>> Yeah. So circadian rhythm is is

441
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,000
basically whenever light is interacting

442
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,120
with your pineal gland coming through

443
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,360
your eyes, it's going to help to

444
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,440
regulate hormones within your body. So

445
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,279
appetite like grein, leptin, uh

446
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,560
cortisol, melatonin, all those hormones

447
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,680
are being regulated because of your

448
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,199
circadian rhythm. And so when you're

449
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,639
awake in the morning time, you're

450
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,920
starting that circadian clock. And so

451
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,120
when you eat food in the morning, that

452
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
kind of breaks your fast, right? That's

453
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,000
why we have breakfast.

454
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,920
>> A lot of women that I work with, they

455
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,839
are told to fast, right? And so they're

456
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,240
skipping breakfast, but they're yet

457
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,639
having caffeine or caffeine with sugar

458
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,000
or milk or whatever in it, breaking

459
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
their fast, and that's their breakfast.

460
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,519
And so they're starting their day off

461
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,600
with this disregulated circadian rhythm

462
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,680
already. And so now all of a sudden

463
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,760
insulin, which is going to be regulating

464
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,600
your sugar coming into your body, which

465
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,839
is essentially energy, it's going to be

466
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,199
saying like, "Hey, let's store this as

467
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,720
fat because we're going to need it as

468
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,720
for later for a rainy day

469
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,480
>> instead of utilizing it for energy

470
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,360
uptake throughout the duration of your

471
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,360
day." So now you're going to start

472
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,000
having fatigue. You're having more fat

473
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,160
storage

474
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
>> just because you had a bad start to your

475
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,880
day. Okay. And so if you do that

476
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,560
frequently and then you have other

477
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,079
stressors of like you're eating toxic

478
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,760
food like a lot of processed food or

479
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,000
ultrarocessed food that's adding even

480
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,839
more of a burden to your system or maybe

481
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,279
you're exposed to m exposed to mold or

482
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,600
maybe you have parasites or heavy metals

483
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,920
or just radiation from your phone.

484
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,000
>> Now all of a sudden your cells are very

485
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,079
toxic laden and they're having to work

486
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
on all these extra stressors which is

487
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,079
essentially what's happening to your

488
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,800
body. So oxidative stress is essentially

489
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,800
what's happening and a lot of women are

490
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,560
just not really able to fully see the

491
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,240
the dots that they're connecting as far

492
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,519
as like why they feel the way they feel

493
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
and why their cells are not functioning

494
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,199
well and then subsequently why they have

495
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
you know like thyroid issues or sex

496
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,079
hormone issues or infertility issues

497
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,560
because all that stuff is connected back

498
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,680
to each other.

499
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,040
>> So it's so funny you were saying that

500
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,720
most women wake up in the morning and

501
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,000
tend to so I was having black coffee in

502
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,399
the morning and then I'd go work out and

503
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,320
then I'd come back and have a protein

504
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,839
breakfast right and then a dear friend

505
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,880
of mine Dr. John Kim was like, "I don't

506
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,040
think you can do that because your

507
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,800
hormones are so wired right now. Your

508
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,399
cortisol is really high." So, he taught

509
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,759
me this recipe. It's called a Russian

510
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,880
custard. Have you heard of it? Yeah.

511
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,959
>> So, basically, two egg yolks raw with a

512
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,399
little bit of sea salt and honey. And

513
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,160
he's like, "The first thing you do is

514
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,600
besides have water with electrolytes and

515
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,120
minerals. Right after that, you're going

516
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,959
to take this shot of this Russian

517
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,639
custard and then you can have your

518
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,240
coffee." Right. But that is what you

519
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,079
have to do because your body has to

520
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,279
absorb the nutrients before the cup of

521
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,040
coffee hits your stomach.

522
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,560
>> Yeah. Because caffeine spikes cortisol

523
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
and cortisol is going to spike your need

524
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,519
for blood sugar for sugar. And so you're

525
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
going to have more sugar cravings.

526
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,759
You're going to be more hungry. You're

527
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,519
going to be more likely to have snacks

528
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,120
in between meals. And all this is just

529
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,720
causing this disregulated circadian

530
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
rhythm. So that when you do go

531
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
throughout your day now, you're going to

532
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
have a big crash in the afternoon or

533
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,279
>> that was happening to me.

534
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,720
>> Yeah. Or then when you uh do eat a meal,

535
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,920
you're going to want to overeat. And

536
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,279
then when you do go to bed, you're going

537
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,720
to have disregulated sleep and then

538
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,240
you're going to start this whole vicious

539
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,279
cycle. So circular rhythm would be the

540
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,959
first thing that I would say would be

541
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,759
the what you need to fix as a as a

542
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,600
female.

543
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,240
>> Uh second thing would be um I think just

544
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,679
ensuring you understand what your toxic

545
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,039
burden is, right? And so I kind of

546
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,679
mentioned this a little bit already, but

547
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,720
a lot of women don't know.

548
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,919
They don't know what they don't know,

549
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,039
right? Just like most of us, if you

550
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,000
don't test, you don't if you don't know

551
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,120
kind of what's going on, you're not

552
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,120
going to have any idea where to start.

553
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,280
So, if you've been exposed to mold or

554
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,880
you have a history of mono and EBV or

555
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,079
you've had issues with parasites or

556
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,720
heavy metals, like all these things I

557
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,720
said, if you have that kind of brewing

558
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,240
in the background and you're taking, you

559
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,520
know, your your supplements, you're

560
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,840
eating the right food and you're you're

561
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,480
trying to do all these things, exercise,

562
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,559
>> but you have these underlying um

563
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,840
stressors to your cells, you're you're

564
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,039
going to be kind of chasing your tail

565
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,480
for a while. Like, and that's what I was

566
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,720
mentioning with your symptoms before. if

567
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,320
you don't know what you're really trying

568
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,080
to fix and you're just trying to fix a

569
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,520
symptom, there's a lot of reasons you

570
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,799
could have certain symptoms. And so,

571
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,640
it's not always just like, oh, I have a

572
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,720
runny nose, it's this, or I have joint

573
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,760
pain, it's this. It's like, well, it

574
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
could be many things. And so, you have

575
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,160
to kind of get at the root of that. And

576
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,039
that's where I would say to be the

577
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,760
second thing. Um, comments on that or

578
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,280
>> No, I think um a lot of times we are,

579
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,000
like you said, we're so focused on the

580
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,679
on the symptom that we forget that we

581
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,360
have to zoom back and look at the larger

582
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,799
picture. How are we sleeping? How are we

583
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
eating? what are external stressors in

584
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,200
our life? How are we getting enough

585
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,039
sleep? Right?

586
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,480
>> So, when my hormones were completely out

587
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,080
of whack this summer, I realized I

588
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,720
wasn't getting enough REM or deep sleep

589
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,640
at all. And when I started fixing my

590
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,080
sleep hygiene, having a proper like

591
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,440
nighttime routine, making sure I'm in

592
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,320
bed by 10:00, trying to put away my

593
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,320
phone, um turning off my phone so I'm

594
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,160
not getting any of the EMF of radiation

595
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,400
coming through. And I just checked my

596
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,840
sleep score. And my sleep score after

597
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,360
four months, for the first time ever,

598
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,000
five months was like at a 98.

599
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,360
>> Wow. And I had two and a half hours of

600
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,480
REM sleep, an hour and a half of deep

601
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
sleep. And I was like, "Wow,

602
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,880
>> big difference.

603
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,640
>> It makes such a big difference." But

604
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,799
that was getting my body the right

605
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,120
nutrients, circadian rhythm cycling, and

606
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,400
then from there, making sure that I'm

607
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,080
working on my sleep hygiene.

608
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,520
>> Yeah. Yeah. And it's it's the boring

609
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,000
stuff, right? Like it's the things that

610
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
really

611
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,520
>> But that's the beautiful part. It's the

612
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,880
free stuff that people don't realize.

613
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,640
Start with the things that are free

614
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,240
before you go buy another supplement,

615
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,840
before you get on this. And even before,

616
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,520
you tell me if this is right or wrong.

617
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,880
Before you consider getting on hormone

618
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,679
replacement therapy, I think you need to

619
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,919
fix certain like functions in your life

620
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,720
and make sure you're creating certain

621
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,280
healthier habits and then adding in the

622
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,480
hormones.

623
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,640
>> Yeah, that's always been my stance

624
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,880
because if you just add hormones to a

625
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,480
broken system, you're just going to feed

626
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240
you're going to feed this the the the

627
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,320
wrong pathway that is causing the

628
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,400
problem. So, a lot of women will get

629
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,679
like testosterone or they'll get, you

630
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,200
know, estrogen or progesterone,

631
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,600
whatever. But if they're already having

632
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,440
a dysfunctional hormonal pathway,

633
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,960
they're just going to re-emphasize the

634
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
problem and so it's going to exacerbate

635
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,720
it.

636
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,320
>> Um, and this is the same with

637
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,679
parmenopause, too. Like a lot of women

638
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,760
that are going through parmenopause,

639
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,919
entering menopause think that, well,

640
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,720
this is like a dysfunctional thing, but

641
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,320
the reality is parmenopause is is is

642
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,880
happening for about 10 years up until

643
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,400
menopause occurs, right? And so a lot

644
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,919
of, you know, conventional doctors be

645
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,280
like, "Well, once you don't have a cycle

646
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,360
for 12 months, now you're you're

647
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,280
menopausal, you're postmenopausal." It's

648
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,720
like, it's like if you if you like were

649
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,160
pregnant and and the doctor's like,

650
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
"Well, you're not pregnant until the the

651
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,080
baby's here." Correct.

652
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,280
>> It's like, "No, like you've been

653
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,120
pregnant this whole time leading up to

654
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,200
it." Absolutely. And so I think a lot of

655
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,280
people um will throw hormones at a

656
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,760
problem when they don't realize that

657
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,840
there are symptoms like you know PMS or

658
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,080
mood swings or you know weight gain or

659
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,720
fatigue or brain fog happening for 10

660
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,080
years leading up to menopause that needs

661
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,960
to be addressed. And if you address

662
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,120
those things, then menopause is actually

663
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,480
>> uh you go from fertility to stability,

664
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,480
right? Like it's if you have good

665
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,159
hormonal balance leading up to it, it

666
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,240
can be a great experience for a female

667
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,760
to become, you know, transition into a

668
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,200
different phase of life where you can be

669
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,159
a stable force rather than like a

670
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,320
fertile force.

671
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,159
>> And I think um but it all gets back to

672
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,760
like the foundational problems that were

673
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,760
persisting before that.

674
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,760
>> So your wife has had four beautiful,

675
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,159
gorgeous, healthy babies. Is it true

676
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,080
that when a woman gives birth, her body

677
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,320
almost experiences right after that like

678
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,520
a menopause like for a little bit?

679
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
>> Yeah, I mean that's why you don't you

680
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,600
don't have a cycle, right? There's that

681
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,640
there's a lack of a cycle.

682
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,280
>> And how long do you not have a cycle

683
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,480
for? I mean,

684
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,919
>> it depends on the woman. So, a lot of it

685
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,640
depends on breastfeeding. So, like if

686
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,159
they're breastfeeding at night um for

687
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,799
like my wife, she she's still

688
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,600
breastfeeding and she just had her cycle

689
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,280
and she's like 12 months post delivery

690
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,200
and so but she was feeding our baby like

691
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,720
all throughout the night until a couple

692
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
couple months ago. her circadian rhythm

693
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,640
is not

694
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,640
>> Yeah. So she's but she's still her

695
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,360
body's still requiring that. So I like

696
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,799
our neighbor for example she you know or

697
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,640
I can't remember maybe one of my wife's

698
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,200
friends she she starts having her cycle

699
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,240
like eight weeks after she

700
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,760
>> and she was breastfeeding or no

701
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,039
>> she her breastfeeding is different from

702
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
and I don't even know who this person is

703
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,960
but this is just my wife has told me. So

704
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,240
either way um it just it varies quite a

705
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,720
bit depending on where you're at. You

706
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,559
know, I feel like the female body and I

707
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,559
had another guest on in London when we

708
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,960
were together uh on the podcast and this

709
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,640
man told me he's like, "We always place

710
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,480
this idea of like strength and courage

711
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,200
and all on the men, but the women are

712
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,200
really truly res resilient more than men

713
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,440
could ever be or dream of being because

714
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,120
imagine a woman who gives birth and she

715
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,799
does not sleep properly sometimes for

716
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,400
years. cuz I have friends who are like

717
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,159
don't really have a nanny, are doing

718
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,159
everything themselves, the baby's always

719
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,159
with them, and some of their kids are

720
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,799
like 2 and 1/2 years old, and they have

721
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,880
not slept properly for 2 and 1/2 years,

722
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,799
>> and they're still functioning at work.

723
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,000
They're a great hands-on mom. They're a

724
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,960
great wife. And I'm like, man, if you

725
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,720
did that to a man, he would fall apart.

726
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,840
Like, a man going through two years of

727
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
sleep regression.

728
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,600
>> Yeah.

729
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,440
>> They wouldn't be functioning.

730
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,280
>> Well, it's it's hard to it's just it's

731
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,720
such a hard and it gets back to what you

732
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,679
were saying before. It's like there's

733
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,120
different

734
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,320
>> there's we have different skill sets and

735
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,600
different abilities.

736
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,679
>> I think men because of our cycles are 24

737
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,520
hours on the clock. Like we're very

738
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,480
stable in that sense. And so

739
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,679
>> we can handle a lot of load and and do

740
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,360
we actually do better with it. I always

741
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,520
say men are like trailers. Like we pull

742
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,520
straighter with a heavier load. And like

743
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,679
I think that is true. Um and that means

744
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,880
that we need a lot of responsibility. We

745
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,080
need to kind of know what direction

746
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
we're going and we need to be kind of

747
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,640
like very aware of that. I think females

748
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,200
um

749
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,799
again there there's a consequence to

750
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,440
those things like I I don't want women

751
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,600
to think that I can do that because I'm

752
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,360
I'm tougher and then it like leads to

753
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,280
these issues because that's why most

754
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,960
women use most the financial health

755
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,200
dollars in the in the world in the

756
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,120
United States because they do have 80%

757
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,559
of the autoimmune issues. They do have

758
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,760
more issues with heart attacks. They're

759
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,960
more likely to die after a heart attack.

760
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,600
They're like they're using more of these

761
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,600
dollars because our society has not

762
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,200
treasured them enough to protect them

763
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,559
enough and understand that hey you're

764
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,760
not getting enough sleep. Maybe we

765
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,520
shouldn't be putting more burden on you

766
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,640
expecting you to work out or doing these

767
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,840
extra things with your career. Like

768
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,200
maybe we should take a bit of a sbatical

769
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,240
from that so we can protect you.

770
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,440
Absolutely. And so I think it's

771
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,400
important to kind of understand like you

772
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
know where we are with that stuff

773
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
because it's

774
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,000
>> there's a bit of a cultural issue on

775
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,919
that like we were saying before.

776
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,679
>> And when it comes to women in their 20s,

777
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,919
30s and 40s, obviously every decade is

778
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,760
so different for a woman than a man. How

779
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,520
can these women listening to the to the

780
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,440
podcast start optimizing their hormones

781
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,480
from 20-year-olds to 30 year olds to 40

782
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,240
and into their 50s?

783
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,679
>> I mean, you again, I would I would do

784
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,120
the circadian rhythm thing really well.

785
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,720
I would figure out what kind of

786
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,559
potential toxic burdens you're you've

787
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,320
been exposed to or dealing with. I would

788
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,000
make sure you understand what a good

789
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,159
supplement regimen looks like for you.

790
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,520
>> Okay. And it's individualized, correct?

791
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,880
>> Yeah. I'll talk about the common ones

792
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,720
that I feel like are most most

793
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,159
appropriate for most women and just

794
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,760
people in general, but I I think for

795
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,200
most women, they need a good methylated

796
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,679
B complex. I think that's such a

797
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,559
critical

798
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,039
>> why is that?

799
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,880
>> Um, so about 60% of women have MTHFR and

800
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,480
so that's that issue with you don't you

801
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,919
don't basically detoxify, you don't

802
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,120
methylate very well and that's genetic

803
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,880
variant. So there's nothing you can

804
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,720
really do about that. I have that. My

805
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,120
wife has that. Most people probably

806
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,400
haven't unfortunately. Um, and so if you

807
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,159
have that, you need you need these

808
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,840
methylated B vitamins that can be easily

809
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,919
absorbed so that you can then make

810
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,520
energy, detoxify, and methylation

811
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,880
happens about 300 billion times a day.

812
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,840
So, it's like a very important process

813
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,200
that needs to occur.

814
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,360
>> If it's such an important process, how

815
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,640
does 60% of the population have this

816
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,440
disruption?

817
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,039
>> Um, I think I've researched this a

818
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,279
little bit, but I think that has some of

819
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,559
it has to do with folic acid that we're

820
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
putting into our our foods and

821
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,640
fortifying cereals and things like that.

822
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,400
>> So, it's become worse over the years.

823
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,760
>> It's hard to say that with confidence.

824
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,760
According to my research and what I've

825
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,600
read, um, we don't know that for sure,

826
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,960
but there definitely seems to be some

827
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,520
worsening of that or at least more

828
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,080
awareness to it. But either way, um it's

829
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,679
a big problem. And so you can you can

830
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,440
very easily mitigate that by taking a

831
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,720
methylated B complex. And some people

832
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,840
don't do well with that depending if

833
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,360
they have like comp tea or something

834
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,960
like that. But most of the time it's a

835
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,039
good option. And so you can get

836
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,480
methylolate into your system. The

837
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,799
problem is a lot of women that are

838
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,200
pregnant will give um will take folic

839
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,120
acid because that's what they're told um

840
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,279
in their in their prenatalss. And folic

841
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,799
acid if you have MTHFR is like a toxin.

842
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,200
It's very very toxic for your system. So

843
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,240
you'll

844
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
>> And they're not even checking these

845
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,840
women.

846
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,760
>> No, they don't check them. So they're

847
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,600
told to take folic acid to to prevent

848
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,600
like cerebral palsy and all these

849
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,039
different kind of things and um or no

850
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,120
spinoipida I think is maybe what it is

851
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,159
but we're taking it and then afterwards

852
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,720
they're having a lot of postpartum

853
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,320
depression and according again to my

854
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,600
research it's because of the folic acid

855
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,640
detoxification that they're having to

856
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,240
get out of their system and so they'll

857
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,600
have this postpartum depression. So

858
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,159
taking a methylated B complex is

859
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,960
critical in my opinion. Um omega-3 fatty

860
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,039
acids are very very low. So um we should

861
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,200
have like a 1:1 ratio of omega 6s to

862
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,320
omega-3s. We're like a 20 to1 ratio is

863
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
kind of where most people are in the

864
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,120
population

865
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,799
>> and that's super helpful for your cell

866
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,799
membrane being flexible so you can get

867
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,480
things in and out of your cell. Um so

868
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,640
that omega-3 would be a really important

869
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,400
one. Um obviously magnesium I'm a huge

870
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,760
fan of magnesium glycinate. It's a good

871
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,840
jack of all trades. It can be taken on

872
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,919
an empty stomach. It's it does very well

873
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,080
for people taking it 200 400 milligrams

874
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840
before bed is usually a good option. Um

875
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,760
and then vitamin D can be a really good

876
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,960
one as well. Yeah. With K2

877
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,120
>> because so many people are vitamin D

878
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,360
deficient. It's very very very common.

879
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,559
>> It's very common because if you're So

880
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,880
when you're deficient, it often means

881
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,880
that you're inflamed. So, uh, your

882
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,640
body's actually utilizing that vitamin D

883
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,840
to help you. So, you can't see it on a

884
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,600
lab test because it's not floating

885
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,679
around your in your blood. But, if you

886
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,200
if you were to look at most people and

887
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,720
if they didn't have high inflammation,

888
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,679
they probably have sufficient levels of

889
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,200
vitamin D. The other issue is when you

890
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,880
take too much and it's not converting

891
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,919
well because you're not taking K2 or you

892
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,080
don't have enough magnesium, you start

893
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,600
to deplete those resources. And so you

894
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,120
can actually create more problems if

895
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,720
you're taking especially if you're

896
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,480
taking like D2 which is synthetic and

897
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,559
your doctor's giving you 50,000 IUs once

898
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,240
a week and it doesn't get paired with

899
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,919
magnesium or vitamin K2. Now all of a

900
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,360
sudden you start calcifying your

901
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,640
arteries or your joints and things like

902
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,760
that and it can cause a lot more

903
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,799
problems. So you got to be careful with

904
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,799
that and you got to make sure you kind

905
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,559
of know like what your issue is and then

906
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,080
pair it with the right supplements. So

907
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,159
that would be the the other one to

908
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,440
consider. Um yeah,

909
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,200
>> and for women who are trying to

910
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,200
conceive, let's say, so this is, you

911
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,880
know, we we told everybody 20s, 30s,

912
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,559
40s, these are vitamins that they need

913
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,840
to get on. We talked about three

914
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,919
different things, ways to optimize

915
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,279
themselves from circadium rhythm, making

916
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,279
sure they're obviously, you know,

917
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,240
careful with any sort of depletion. When

918
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,600
it comes to um additional things that

919
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,200
they should be doing, is there anything

920
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,960
else that women should be start checking

921
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,240
or be like, okay, in this decade of my

922
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,080
life, this is what I need to be paying

923
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,240
attention to? Yeah, I think in your 20s,

924
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,159
um, I I would I would the mindset I

925
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,480
would have is don't abuse your body.

926
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,480
Like just start to appreciate it and

927
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,520
treasure it and take care of it. Um,

928
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,120
staying up late, drinking a bunch of

929
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
alcohol, you know, not taking vitamins

930
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,799
at that point, skipping breakfast,

931
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,120
fasting, doing all these high intense

932
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,720
exercises, especially not respecting

933
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,320
where you are in your cycle. Yeah.

934
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,399
>> Um, just getting a decent understanding

935
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,399
of how your body should function at a at

936
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,320
a at a foundational level would be the

937
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,399
20s. The 30s would be kind of

938
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,919
understanding that

939
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,840
um the reason that diseases kind of

940
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,000
persist or develop is that you spend

941
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,080
more time in a state of deficiency. And

942
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,760
so when you start seeing like oh I'm 35

943
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,360
or I'm 36 now I'm starting to have these

944
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,720
issues that just came out of nowhere.

945
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,080
>> In my opinion it's like well you've

946
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,679
you've been deficient from these things

947
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,520
for 15 20 years and now you're starting

948
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,880
to see the the fruit of your labor.

949
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,279
>> Um so kind of getting an understanding

950
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,120
of of that and then starting to counter

951
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,240
it by actually taking those things

952
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,840
having good sleep hygiene. Um, and in

953
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,200
understanding again that less is

954
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,640
probably going to be more at that point

955
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,039
in time. Um, and I think for a lot of

956
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,039
us, we don't have much peace. Like we

957
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,919
don't have much Sabbath. We don't have

958
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,840
much rest. And, uh, if we have these bad

959
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,600
habits from our 20s, our 30s just kind

960
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,679
of exemplify that. They kind of just

961
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,440
exacerbate it a little bit. So, I think

962
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,120
getting some rhythms in your life to

963
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,880
where you have some stability of in

964
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,120
peace and calm um, would be really

965
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,720
important in your 30s. And then your 40s

966
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,919
again it's be extension of all these

967
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,440
things that I just mentioned but I think

968
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,760
in your 40s it would be understanding

969
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,679
like why your body is transitioning and

970
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,440
and why that's important. And so again

971
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,279
for a female it's understanding that

972
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,039
parmenopause is is actually a good

973
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,039
thing. You know it's it's by design.

974
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,960
It's it's not a problem but then

975
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,799
understanding that you can use things

976
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,480
like you know biioidentical hormone

977
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,960
replacement therapy to kind of

978
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,760
specifically target your deficiencies

979
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,840
but it's not it's not a it's not a a

980
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,960
replacement necessarily. It's like it's

981
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,320
like a supplement. It's like you want to

982
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,880
you want to use it supplementally to

983
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,399
kind of

984
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,480
>> fill the gap a little bit. Correct.

985
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,080
>> But I think if you just do that and not

986
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,000
do anything else like we said before,

987
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,679
it's not going to do as much as it could

988
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,360
for you at least long term.

989
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,440
>> And if we want to educate the audience

990
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,039
also on bioidentical hormones, right?

991
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,320
Obviously the difference between

992
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,000
synthetic versus non-synthetic and then

993
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,120
also where they should be starting with

994
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
that. Obviously going to see a

995
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,039
specialist for that.

996
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,440
>> For sure. Yeah, you definitely want to

997
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,200
get with uh I mean the way that I work

998
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,440
with my clients is that you know I don't

999
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,480
prescribe medications and so we we like

1000
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,240
to work with them before or after

1001
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,440
they've done bioidentical hormone

1002
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,200
replacement therapy but if

1003
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,960
>> you partner with a hormone specialist

1004
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,240
like somebody who can give them the

1005
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,640
hormones if they need you

1006
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,919
>> not no like we we found that there's

1007
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,840
just so many people out there that do

1008
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,600
that like we're usually working with

1009
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,880
them before they do it or after they're

1010
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,640
like hey I've already tried this and it

1011
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,919
didn't work now what should I do and so

1012
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,240
we're trying to get

1013
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,520
to like optimize so that they can then

1014
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,120
adjust their dosage accordingly. But um

1015
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,799
sorry what was your first the question?

1016
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,720
>> The first question was teaching women

1017
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,880
about like hormones like bio identical

1018
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,080
hormones and stuff. So in and then so

1019
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,080
I'd reverse kind of the question being

1020
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,600
like how do you prepare these people for

1021
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,480
that? Is it the things we already spoke

1022
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,919
about the three kind of um points or is

1023
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,240
there additional stuff that you guys add

1024
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,279
in?

1025
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,799
>> Yeah, we I always start with the

1026
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,480
foundational things first. just said and

1027
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,520
then depending on the the person, the

1028
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,799
woman, we'll then look at them

1029
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,320
individually and say like, "Okay, this

1030
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,919
is what your apparent issues are." And

1031
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,919
then we'll walk them through a detox of

1032
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,279
of parasites, heavy metals, radiation,

1033
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,240
mold, just to make sure that we kind of

1034
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,840
know that those things have been

1035
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,520
addressed. And then from there, it just

1036
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,200
depends on like if we need to do a Dutch

1037
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,360
test or whatever to kind of identify

1038
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,279
specific deficiencies. But more times

1039
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,200
than not, once you correct the cellular

1040
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,039
level, their hormones start to be

1041
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,000
corrected at the same time. So you don't

1042
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,919
really have to I I think the emphasis is

1043
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,760
rarely on getting more biioidentical

1044
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,440
hormones. It's more about reducing the

1045
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,039
the dosage that they were already on or

1046
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,640
not having it at all.

1047
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,799
>> And then what is your take I wrote this

1048
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,240
down about DHEA? Do you like it? Do you

1049
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,279
not like it? Do you ever recommend it to

1050
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,519
your patients?

1051
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,440
>> Yeah, it's a mixed bag. I think mixed

1052
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,200
>> it seems to be very low dose. I think a

1053
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,519
lot of women that are getting it,

1054
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,760
they're taking like 25 milligrams and

1055
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,760
again it's feeding this cascade of of

1056
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,880
hormonal events that is feeding it

1057
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,320
improperly. And so so like for example

1058
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,399
if it's kind of hard to pick I have like

1059
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,080
this picture in my head. So if you have

1060
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,200
like cholesterol which is a building

1061
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
block your hormones and you have

1062
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,240
pregnalone and you kind of go

1063
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,519
progesterone cortisol over here you have

1064
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,279
like DHEA and and and and from there it

1065
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,960
kind of goes into like testosterone and

1066
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,080
estrogens and all that sort of stuff. If

1067
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,679
you're feeding somebody, if you're

1068
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,360
giving somebody DHEA and it's not

1069
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,760
converting well, it'll likely convert to

1070
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,159
like androgens and become unfavorable in

1071
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,760
terms of testosterone. So, if you just

1072
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,360
give somebody DHEA and you don't correct

1073
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,279
anything else, at least from what I've

1074
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,919
seen, it doesn't usually bode well for

1075
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,159
them.

1076
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,159
>> How can you tell if DHEA is not

1077
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,200
converting properly for somebody?

1078
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,559
>> I mean, you'll probably just have a

1079
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,159
worsening of your symptoms. like you

1080
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,600
probably have worsening of like thinning

1081
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,360
of hair on your head, maybe facial hair

1082
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,600
on your face, maybe more issues with

1083
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,039
estrogen becoming um

1084
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,000
>> yeah, like you're not detoxing from

1085
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,679
estrogen, so you're becoming more

1086
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,960
estrogen dominant. You can have so if

1087
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,799
you're taking if you have a cycle, it

1088
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,080
could worsen your cycle a little bit.

1089
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,120
>> Um and again, this is like more of a

1090
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,240
longer term perspective. I think

1091
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,919
shortterm it could probably be like, oh,

1092
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,200
I feel better for the first couple

1093
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,320
months. Yeah. And then after a while,

1094
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,000
you're like now all of a sudden things

1095
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,480
are going wrong. So it just it has to be

1096
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,320
nuanced with with the client. For sure.

1097
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,480
when it comes to the role of emotions

1098
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,840
with women's health. Um I think I

1099
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,200
thought it was yesterday I saw something

1100
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,159
on Instagram by Dr. Mary

1101
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,279
>> Claire

1102
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,200
>> and she talked about how now we know the

1103
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,559
ovaries themselves are an entire

1104
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,320
ecosystem

1105
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,760
>> and I found that post really really

1106
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,440
fascinating because we just thought okay

1107
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,919
the ovaries you know are this organ that

1108
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,279
kind of she's like no the ovaries are so

1109
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,600
hyperlin to your nervous system that

1110
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,960
they take all the bof feedback. So if

1111
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,559
you're in a state of fight or flight or

1112
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,480
if you're in a state of rest and digest,

1113
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,799
the ovaries fill it. And what happens

1114
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,159
when you're aging, the ovaries become

1115
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,360
more and more and more and more

1116
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,519
sensitive to that. And so it's this

1117
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,360
massive ecosystem that is playing and

1118
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,840
and is regulated by your nervous system,

1119
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,600
right?

1120
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,960
>> Which I don't think any of us have

1121
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,679
really stopped and thought about that

1122
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,559
when it comes to women's women's health.

1123
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,120
>> Yeah. I think and again it that should

1124
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,240
be well known in in in like the health

1125
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,399
care space but it's not we don't really

1126
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,240
emphasize that enough because you know

1127
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,520
your hypothalamus your pituitary gland

1128
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,760
your adrenal glands your thyroid and

1129
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,520
your gonads they all work on this axis

1130
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,040
and so it's like when your thyroid is

1131
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,079
influenced by stress then your adrenal

1132
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,000
glands are influenced and then your

1133
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,079
gonads which is your ovaries and right

1134
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,760
>> testes depending on your sex like that's

1135
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,520
that's all working within this this

1136
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,839
ecosystem or this axis that is

1137
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,359
influencing each other and so you When

1138
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,000
women are going through permenopause and

1139
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,760
they're transitioning to post-menopause,

1140
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,960
they no longer make progesterone in

1141
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,320
their ovaries. They only make it in

1142
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,760
their adrenal glands now. So, like you

1143
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,040
make this huge switch from your from

1144
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,520
your ovaries to adrenal glands. That's

1145
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,919
why stress becomes a much bigger factor

1146
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,119
when it comes to balanced health. And

1147
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,200
that's why women start to experience a

1148
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,040
lot of hot flashes because if you get a

1149
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,800
lot of stress one day or your your blood

1150
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,280
sugar spikes or you had poor sleep,

1151
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,399
>> fatigue.

1152
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,679
>> Yeah. you're going to spike that and

1153
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,160
you're going to have a sudden uh

1154
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,160
epinephrine rush or adrenaline rush and

1155
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,359
that's where you have a hot flash. And

1156
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,480
so a lot of women are getting that in

1157
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,240
the middle of the night throughout

1158
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,800
throughout the day and it correlates so

1159
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,240
much back to your nervous system 100%.

1160
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,599
>> And then so when you're when you're

1161
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,040
working with these women in in your

1162
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,720
practice and stuff, how do you support

1163
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,640
them with the with the emotional side of

1164
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,400
stuff if it's so important to their

1165
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,000
overall health and to their hormones and

1166
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,920
everything? I think a lot of it gets

1167
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,920
back to just having the conversations

1168
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
upfront about the importance of it and

1169
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,680
and understanding that like hey this is

1170
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,520
something that you are able to have an

1171
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,680
impact on right like you have control

1172
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,440
over this as much as you know you can

1173
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,560
and if if they have a partner or spouse

1174
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,760
it's like saying hey

1175
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,760
>> we need to get them involved to

1176
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,680
understand what their role in this is as

1177
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,960
well and also if you have kids like they

1178
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,480
need to know that mom's in a state of

1179
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,520
healing or you know that that whoever

1180
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,720
this person is that they're in a state

1181
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,720
of healing and just like if you break

1182
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,800
your wrist you're not going to just put

1183
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,240
a cast on and take the cast off you on

1184
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,280
the weekends to go play basketball, like

1185
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,720
you're going to like be on a healing

1186
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,079
journey. And this healing journey is

1187
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,839
going to require that you have some

1188
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,200
stability at home, that you have good

1189
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,960
sleep patterns, that you have good

1190
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,320
adherence to your diet, that you take

1191
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,680
your supplements, and like the family

1192
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,599
needs to know like what you're doing and

1193
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,359
why. And then they can help to support

1194
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,720
you because if they don't if we don't

1195
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,240
bring that up though in the beginning,

1196
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,520
then they're just they're not going to

1197
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
be thinking about it enough to actually

1198
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,599
do something with it

1199
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,119
>> and feel supported enough at home.

1200
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,960
>> Yeah. And feel supported. And so I think

1201
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,119
there's that component to it, but also

1202
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,200
they need to have a belief that what

1203
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,480
they do makes a difference. And so like

1204
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,000
if they're going into a meal and they um

1205
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,079
understand that like if I'm eating this

1206
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,119
food in a rush state or my nervous

1207
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,240
system is all wound up, I'm not going to

1208
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,599
be able to digest this food very well.

1209
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,119
So maybe I should be praying before a

1210
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,240
meal to kind of like do some deep

1211
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,000
breaths and kind of make sure I'm

1212
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,520
correcting my nervous system so I can

1213
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,880
Yeah, I can regulate a little bit. or

1214
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,760
like what you can do before bed if

1215
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,440
you're all wound up and you're having

1216
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,200
racing thoughts like you know you can

1217
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,240
take magnesium 38ate you can do box

1218
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,680
breathing you can do these different

1219
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,200
things to kind of control this and just

1220
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,960
giving them the tools and the belief

1221
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,400
that if they do it it'll actually work I

1222
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,839
think helps quite a bit

1223
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,960
>> and I also went to jump since we're

1224
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,040
speaking about women's health and

1225
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,079
hormones for young women who are on

1226
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,440
birth control

1227
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,920
>> what is your advice for that

1228
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,640
>> don't do it yeah just don't do it I mean

1229
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,680
I think controlling a cycle with birth

1230
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,680
control or helping to control symptoms

1231
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,280
uh it's it's just a whole it's the

1232
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,599
epitome of what our conventional medical

1233
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,520
system is and it's just honestly kind of

1234
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,160
disgraceful um especially for young

1235
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,320
women that are missing out on the peak

1236
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,760
phase of their of their cycle like that

1237
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,160
the best time that they could experience

1238
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,400
is like being eliminated and the reality

1239
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,920
is you know a lot of these these issues

1240
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,880
are metabolic issues like they're

1241
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,320
they're issues that need to be

1242
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,920
controlled through what they consume how

1243
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,480
they regulate their circadian rhythm

1244
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,359
>> and not

1245
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,800
>> insulin resistance

1246
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,320
>> yeah insulin resistance and not just

1247
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,200
taking a pill that would you know

1248
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,480
deplete B12 B6 folate zinc and and

1249
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,280
create a whole host of other issues with

1250
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,960
autoimmunity, estrogen dominance, PCOS,

1251
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,320
like the list goes on and on.

1252
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,320
>> So, this what happened to me when I was

1253
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,760
younger. I got diagnosed with um I was

1254
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,119
getting a lot of ovarian cyst. I didn't

1255
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,160
have PCOS, so I would just get really

1256
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,760
large cyst

1257
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,880
>> and they put me on birth control when I

1258
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,720
was really young. So, then I went

1259
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,480
through years on birth control.

1260
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,160
Obviously became really deficient in all

1261
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,640
my minerals and stuff. Those leeched out

1262
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,640
of me. And then as I got older, as I

1263
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,320
entered my 30s, you know, I'm 42 now, I

1264
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,240
started having like things I would get

1265
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,000
migraines. I wasn't feeling well. I feel

1266
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,680
really drained. I was starting to look

1267
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,280
really gaunt. And it wasn't until I

1268
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,000
found a functional meiosin doctor who

1269
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,839
said, "You have estrogen dominance. You

1270
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,960
have candida. You need to completely get

1271
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,320
off birth control. You shouldn't even be

1272
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,320
touching it. You're completely

1273
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,359
depleted." And until I started working

1274
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,240
on that foundational health, I didn't

1275
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,440
feel well my entire life. So 30 years of

1276
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,800
my life was spent kind of not feeling

1277
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,800
well. It wasn't until like kind of my

1278
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,160
mid30s when I started taking this

1279
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,079
different route and started

1280
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,520
supplementing and taking care of myself

1281
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,480
that the building blocks started back

1282
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,560
up. Wow.

1283
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,320
>> And so, like you said, in your 20s and

1284
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,640
30s, if you're spending your time being

1285
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,960
so depleted, then in your 40s,

1286
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,839
everything just hits you like, you know,

1287
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
I'm just getting older.

1288
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,160
>> Yeah. And it just kind of hits you

1289
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,920
because your body's been running on

1290
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,320
fumes for so long, it cannot sustain

1291
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,079
itself anymore. And so that's when I was

1292
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,200
like, "Oh, I'm vitamin D deficient or

1293
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,960
this that, and the other, and I need to

1294
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,640
supplement." It's because I spent so

1295
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,400
many years on this birth control. It

1296
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,320
took away basic minerals that my body

1297
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,480
needed. And they were trying to treat my

1298
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,960
ovarian cysts with birth control, which

1299
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,359
by the way didn't always work anyways.

1300
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,119
And all it did was disrupt my cycle when

1301
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,119
nobody bothered treating my estrogen

1302
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,640
dominance, which was causing

1303
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,480
>> the rancis to begin with.

1304
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,760
>> Yeah. And that's that's a story for most

1305
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,599
women, you know, and I think u

1306
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,000
it's it's very it's very unfortunate and

1307
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,040
I I again I don't know what else to do

1308
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,160
except for what we're doing right now

1309
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,160
and to talk about it and to kind of

1310
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,599
bring more awareness to it because

1311
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,680
conventional doctors just don't have the

1312
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,000
bandwidth or the resources to really

1313
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,520
properly fix it and and following the

1314
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,839
algorithm that they've been trained in.

1315
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,760
That's that's the next best step is

1316
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,839
birth control and then it's a partial

1317
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,000
hysterctomy and then you know and here's

1318
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,640
some some more pills after that. And so

1319
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,440
it just

1320
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,800
>> it's a cycle.

1321
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,320
>> It's a huge cycle and u

1322
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,320
>> and it feeds the medical system.

1323
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,560
>> Yeah. It's uh it's it's hard because

1324
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,400
doctors do doctor doctors aren't like

1325
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,920
they want to help people most of the

1326
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,800
times. It's just they've been trained to

1327
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,400
think that

1328
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,240
>> if I don't know it then nobody else

1329
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,960
knows this. Correct. And so that creates

1330
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,320
this this hierarchal issue to where the

1331
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,839
information that's being passed down to

1332
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,839
them is what they're studying and being

1333
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,760
trained in and becoming an expert in

1334
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,440
>> when we're ignoring this whole other

1335
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,680
section of of health that needs to be

1336
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,880
implemented and tied back in. So, I

1337
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,119
don't know. It might take a few

1338
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,839
generations to see this truly change.

1339
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,839
But I'm hoping

1340
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,200
>> and research I think I think women's

1341
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,720
health for the longest time we were

1342
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,240
told, "Oh, women are just small men and

1343
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,160
we're not at all small men. We're

1344
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,920
completely different." And I think that

1345
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,040
that kind of like putting women to the

1346
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,240
side and being like, "We're not going to

1347
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,440
study your health. We're definitely not

1348
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,320
going to study your hormones. We're

1349
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,760
definitely not going to look at your

1350
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,760
ovaries and we don't care about what's

1351
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,200
going on over there has been such a

1352
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,640
disservice." And I feel that quote

1353
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,839
unquote like feminists, if you're

1354
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,839
pushing for anything, you should be

1355
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,160
pushing for more research on women's

1356
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,760
health so women can go back into being

1357
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,200
true to their form and design.

1358
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,640
>> Yeah. Most Yeah. As you said before,

1359
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,240
most studies are not looking at women.

1360
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,440
They're looking at men and they're not

1361
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,800
looking at pregnant women and they're

1362
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,400
not looking at different stages of where

1363
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,440
women are cycle and not controlling for

1364
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,839
those variables.

1365
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,839
>> And so, yeah, you have a very uh

1366
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,079
>> lopsided, you know, perspective on this

1367
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,599
stuff and it's just uh Yeah, they're not

1368
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,920
they're not little men by any means.

1369
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,680
>> No.

1370
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,200
>> Yeah. I wanted to quickly talk about us

1371
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,200
and your personal journey from

1372
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,800
traditional kind of medicine into you

1373
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,480
know kind of this whole like space.

1374
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,240
Yeah. Um you know your brother had

1375
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,359
gotten sick and so how did that impact

1376
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,240
you? I know your brother was diagnosed

1377
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,319
with leukemia.

1378
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,359
>> Yeah he had leukemia when he was 14. I

1379
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,560
was 12. Um that was that really

1380
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,599
motivated me to want to get in the

1381
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,079
health space. I didn't really know what

1382
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,520
I wanted to do with it. It was um yeah,

1383
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,040
it was kind of shocking as a 12-year-old

1384
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,319
to kind of be in the hospital and see

1385
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,480
him lose his hair and like get

1386
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,560
injections all the time and just

1387
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,160
>> um you know, he he survived and he got

1388
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,560
through it and he's doing well now, but

1389
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,000
he had you know, two like knee surgeries

1390
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,520
and he's had some issues after that

1391
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,440
because like the the chemo and radiation

1392
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,200
just destroyed his bones and

1393
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,640
>> you know he's he's had three kids and

1394
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,680
you know he's he's actually survived

1395
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,680
really well. Um but it still it had a

1396
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,760
huge ripple effect on my my parents, my

1397
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,720
mom, my dad um just all the issues they

1398
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,319
had to go through and then they started

1399
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,520
getting their own health problems and

1400
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,920
you know there was there was definitely

1401
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,000
some issues in terms of our um lifestyle

1402
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,680
factors and high stress and just trying

1403
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,680
to survive. And so I really got this

1404
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,000
exposure to all these things and what

1405
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,839
what the consequences of it are and it

1406
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,119
made me just motivated to help to want

1407
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,200
to help people not have to go through

1408
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,599
that. And so that's kind of why I am who

1409
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,280
I am now.

1410
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,920
>> Think about what you do and practice

1411
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,440
what you do.

1412
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,960
>> Yeah. And I had my own issues. I had

1413
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,520
chronic pain, chronic fatigue for like

1414
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,000
10 years when I was like 18 to no 16 to

1415
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,079
like

1416
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,640
>> your peak of your health as a man. You

1417
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,880
had

1418
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,240
>> like I had uh I was taking ibuprofen all

1419
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,800
the time cuz I got a back injury from

1420
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,319
football and then I had like uh more

1421
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,440
back pain that the chiropractor couldn't

1422
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,839
fix and I was just like well what's

1423
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,200
going on here? And turns out I had um a

1424
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,440
stomach ulcer that was happening from

1425
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,280
the ibuprofen and H. pylori and all

1426
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,119
these different issues and then yeah

1427
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,280
just like tons of antibiotics and just

1428
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,720
all the typical stuff and yeah so gut

1429
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,880
was destroyed and then thankfully I met

1430
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,560
my wife and she showed me what cooking

1431
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,400
real food looked like and you know how

1432
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,760
to provide and you know and she like

1433
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,040
that whole energy exchange at your time

1434
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,560
I was like exactly what happened like

1435
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,000
she exchanged that with me and just

1436
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,440
showed me like what that was like on a

1437
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,520
practical basis and

1438
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,200
>> it was uh it was a whole combination of

1439
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,440
things like I met this other provider

1440
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,960
who cured himself from cancer he had

1441
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,280
like this big tumor he fixed naturally

1442
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,480
and he showed me these bunch of people

1443
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,240
that were um very insightful to my my

1444
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,680
yeah my practice and my mind because I

1445
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,880
mean this is important like I'm not a

1446
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,240
physician so like I don't prescribe

1447
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,359
medications like I've never done that

1448
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,119
and so it's really

1449
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,640
>> it's really always forced me to want to

1450
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,040
fix things from a

1451
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,640
>> holistic perspective and honestly I

1452
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,560
always I didn't want to go down the

1453
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,319
conventional medical route like my my

1454
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,599
business partner and colleague he's an

1455
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,359
MD and you know like he um he's kind of

1456
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,440
regretful that he actually did that

1457
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,960
because he spent years trying to untrain

1458
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,160
himself from the things that he learned

1459
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,400
>> the programming that you get at medical

1460
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,319
school,

1461
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,160
>> a lot of indoctrination can happen. So,

1462
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,200
I think the good news is that you can

1463
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,319
work with somebody that's that's been

1464
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,760
trained a certain way and they can still

1465
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,920
come out of it and still see things from

1466
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,800
a very complete perspective. But, uh,

1467
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,000
yeah, like there's a lot of

1468
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,319
indoctrination that happens to all of

1469
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,160
us.

1470
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,359
>> And when it comes to even social media,

1471
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,720
I know you've talked about being in

1472
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,040
social media jail because you've tried

1473
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,560
to educate and talk about things that

1474
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,240
you've learned or experiences you've

1475
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,280
had. How did you kind of overcome that

1476
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,960
with the algorithm? Because the

1477
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,920
algorithm is very unforgiving to that.

1478
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,839
>> Yeah, it's I don't know honestly. I

1479
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,599
think I just stayed persistent with it

1480
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,359
and uh didn't give up and I just through

1481
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,599
a lot of prayer I you know

1482
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,040
>> back in the day I I prayed that you know

1483
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,119
God would open the floodgates and bring

1484
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,599
people to me that wanted help and uh

1485
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,359
that night I had a viral post go crazy

1486
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,880
and um it was like kind of the beginning

1487
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,400
of it all but I've had ups and downs got

1488
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,280
banned on TikTok still haven't got that

1489
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,640
back and

1490
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,560
>> I've had to be careful with a lot of

1491
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,000
things and I I kind of share

1492
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,720
>> as much of the truth as I feel like I

1493
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,359
can

1494
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,640
>> without getting

1495
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,079
>> without getting too far and then like

1496
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,520
people that are in my community or my

1497
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,200
clients I kind

1498
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,480
go as as much as say as much as I need

1499
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,599
to. But yeah, I've just had to be kind

1500
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,760
of tactful with it.

1501
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,200
>> Yeah. Wait, Tik Tok is very unforgiving,

1502
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,280
even more than I would say Instagram

1503
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,119
because it can be something that is, you

1504
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,880
know, it's a piece of advice you want to

1505
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,680
give online, but it says no, like this

1506
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,880
is not with the terms of our community

1507
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,480
and stuff and they can completely like

1508
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,560
shut down your account or flag you and

1509
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,480
then the flag stays forever or they like

1510
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,560
lock out your account because it's not

1511
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,839
according to community guidelines. Yeah.

1512
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,280
but it's in somebody's practice, you

1513
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,560
know, advice that they want to share.

1514
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,920
>> The worst part is I've had people come

1515
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,119
after my license. Um I've had like some

1516
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,280
just to be honest, like they've been

1517
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,040
very liberal people that have kind of

1518
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,160
filed complaints against me and they're

1519
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,400
not even clients. Like they're just

1520
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,920
people.

1521
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,160
>> Well, I I that's why I don't understand

1522
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,200
how somebody can go out of their way to

1523
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,119
be so cruel.

1524
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,440
>> Yeah. Yeah. And so it's created a hassle

1525
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,960
for me and um I but to me it's just part

1526
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,040
of the part of the job. It's it's worth

1527
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,480
it to me because I know that people I've

1528
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,400
been able to help a lot of people from

1529
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,160
it. So, it's it's part of the job, but

1530
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,400
um yeah, it's just been kind of amazing

1531
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,480
the amount of resistance and I don't

1532
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,319
want to call it persecution, but um in a

1533
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,599
way it's kind of persecution that you

1534
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,240
face if you're trying to share truth.

1535
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,440
And

1536
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,319
>> I don't get everything right. I'll be

1537
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,079
the first one to tell you like I've

1538
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,680
gotten a lot of things wrong. But I

1539
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,280
still feel like the movement that I've

1540
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,680
been a part of like the Maha movement

1541
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,200
and I I mean I'm not like an you know

1542
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,800
official member of the Maha.

1543
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,920
>> We are very supportive of it. That what

1544
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,560
that's what we all believe in, right?

1545
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,680
That's why we're here.

1546
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,960
>> Yeah. We want to make America healthy

1547
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,000
again. Like that's a good movement. And

1548
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,599
so I think um we've all we've all had

1549
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,440
persecution in different ways. And to me

1550
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,480
it doesn't make sense why we should do

1551
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,680
that if we're just trying to help

1552
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,359
people, you know? So

1553
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,960
>> I think it's the heavy indoctrination.

1554
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,599
It's the deep-seated programming. It's

1555
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,760
also fear that people need to

1556
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,280
>> like look at their own decisions for

1557
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,280
their family and their health and be

1558
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,880
like maybe what was their role to play.

1559
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,319
And I think people are too scared to go

1560
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,440
inwards and they're like, "Oh my god,

1561
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,119
like what these people are talking

1562
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,560
about, maybe I had a hand in that and

1563
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,119
maybe set that person in my family might

1564
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,119
have got cancer or set maybe my child

1565
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,400
has certain conditions and maybe I

1566
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,079
overlook certain things." So they're

1567
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,520
angry. They're angry at themselves and

1568
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,119
they project it onto other people which

1569
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,160
is I think it's a lack of

1570
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,920
self-awareness, right?

1571
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,560
>> Well, it takes humil humility to do

1572
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,800
that. Like uh a lot of us are very proud

1573
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,160
and um when you're proud like you don't

1574
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,160
want to make changes. You don't want to

1575
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,520
admit that you're wrong. And again, like

1576
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,000
just like I've had to do. I've had to

1577
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,839
admit when I'm wrong. And I think that's

1578
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,319
again as as a Christian, I feel like if

1579
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:00,960
I can't be humble and I and I can't like

1580
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,480
grow and learn, then like what's why why

1581
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,920
be a Christian? You know, why why have

1582
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,760
that? Because that's really

1583
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,440
>> the backbone of of for me that's my

1584
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,440
backbone. But for people who don't have

1585
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:13,440
faith, like they're going to make their

1586
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,560
god their their political party or their

1587
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,160
conventional medicine. Like they'll

1588
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,440
they'll make that their religion. And so

1589
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,440
like it's going to be very hard to like

1590
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,440
go against your religion when you're

1591
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,200
being told that it's it's wrong. And so

1592
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,920
for me I don't make health is not my

1593
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,440
religion. Like it's not my idol. Um so I

1594
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,599
I just want to be humble with it and

1595
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,960
it's easier to accept you know your

1596
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,200
mistakes at that point.

1597
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,560
>> I wanted to leave your like a piece of

1598
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,160
advice from you to our community um for

1599
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,319
them listening to this podcast like what

1600
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,599
is one massive we've had such incredible

1601
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,760
takeaways but what is one piece of

1602
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,760
advice you'd like to leave them with?

1603
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,520
I mean for me uh the most important

1604
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,079
thing is just again my faith like that

1605
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,839
that to me at the end of the day if I

1606
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,680
have perfect health or terrible health

1607
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,160
like I if I still have Christ and I

1608
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,200
still have my faith and like I I have a

1609
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,839
joy that's um

1610
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,440
>> right

1611
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,520
>> that comes from a place that's

1612
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
sustainable beyond anything else. And so

1613
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,800
if you don't if you don't have that then

1614
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,280
that's that would be my recommendation

1615
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,000
is to find that because that will give

1616
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,599
you a superpower of healing and and

1617
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,560
self-control and discipline that nothing

1618
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,079
else can give you. Um no like self-help

1619
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,760
Tony Robbins like that all those things

1620
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,680
are great but for me it comes from a

1621
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,760
place of where's my foundation what is

1622
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,880
my belief and how does that change how I

1623
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,559
operate in the world.

1624
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,240
>> So I think you know my name in Arabic

1625
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,200
means faith. So Iman actually literally

1626
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,720
means faith. So I went to this um

1627
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,200
seminar this guy was giving and he

1628
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,839
explained what faith truly is and he

1629
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,839
said real faith having faith in creator

1630
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:39,920
in life it's something beyond yourself

1631
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,680
is the following. He said imagine you

1632
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,680
have a bill to pay but you have x amount

1633
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,200
in your bank account and you have a bill

1634
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,880
coming in that you have to pay.

1635
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,280
>> That is not having faith.

1636
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,720
>> Imagine that you have a bill to pay and

1637
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,640
you know you have money coming in. It's

1638
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,960
not quite in your account yet but it's

1639
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:58,559
coming in. So you know okay that's not

1640
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,240
faith either. Blind faith in creator is

1641
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,680
knowing that you have a bill to pay and

1642
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,760
you might have nothing in your bank

1643
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,040
account but you know that creator is

1644
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,280
going to take care of it. Yeah,

1645
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,440
>> that is the unwavering faith that you

1646
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,359
need to have operating through life that

1647
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,960
you know something higher than yourself,

1648
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:16,000
bigger than yourself is going to take

1649
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,599
care of it. That is true faith when you

1650
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,319
have no way of understanding where it's

1651
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,200
going to come from.

1652
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,319
>> Yeah.

1653
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,760
>> But it's going to get resolved.

1654
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,000
>> Yeah. That's the piece that surpasses

1655
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,599
understanding. And I think our culture

1656
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,240
has very little peace. If anything, we

1657
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,359
have no peace.

1658
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,800
>> We also don't have much faith.

1659
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,480
>> Yeah, we have no faith. We have chaos.

1660
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,599
And I think there there are a lot of

1661
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,040
good people out there though that do

1662
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,800
have faith, that do operate in that

1663
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,240
mindset. And we they don't they don't

1664
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,480
get enough attention. We only focus on

1665
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,839
the negative things. But I think um

1666
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,079
yeah, that's that's perfectly said.

1667
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,359
Yeah, I think whether you're like us and

1668
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,119
you're from one of the Abrahamic

1669
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,119
religions or like really just believe in

1670
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,720
source and God and creator, I think it's

1671
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,520
really important to believe in something

1672
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:55,200
beyond yourself in a how I think

1673
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,079
spirituality is the core foundation of

1674
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,400
living well.

1675
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,240
>> Yeah,

1676
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,359
>> that for me is extremely important.

1677
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,040
>> Yeah, I think that's that's what

1678
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,960
holistic holistic health is supposed to

1679
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,040
be, right? And we've we've subtracted a

1680
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,440
huge element of of health when we when

1681
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,960
we do that from people because uh you

1682
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,720
can't study that very well. You can't

1683
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,520
study the conscious mind. And and we we

1684
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,520
like to act like we know what's going

1685
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,119
on. Yeah. We like to act like we know

1686
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,920
what's going on. But most

1687
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,839
>> times

1688
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,440
>> we we have very little knowledge of of

1689
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,200
the of the world in front of us, let

1690
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,200
alone the world that happened before us.

1691
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,880
And I think uh we just have a lot of

1692
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,920
ignorance and a lot of pride again

1693
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,680
>> and a lot of arrogance.

1694
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,280
>> Yeah. A lot of arrogance for sure.

1695
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,960
>> Thank you, Dr. Austin Lakes for flying
