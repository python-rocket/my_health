1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,880
I'm all about finding nutrient-dense

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,480
options that are good for you, organic,

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,919
whole foods because especially I'm a

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,559
founder who's always on the go and I'm

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,120
always looking for ways to eat something

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,599
that fills me up, is good for my body,

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,039
and also it's properly sourced. And so,

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,720
Daily Harvest was a brand that I

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
discovered and I wanted to reach out to

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,080
them and get their CEO on the podcast

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
because these guys are authentic,

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,480
genuine, and their product is incredible

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,840
and it's very nutritious. So, Ricky,

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,240
thank you for coming on to the show

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,840
today.

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,079
>> Of course. Thanks for having me.

17
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,760
>> How did you guys decide with all of the

18
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,360
stuff in the space, you have Sakiraa,

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,800
you have this, you have that. How did

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,800
you guys decide to come up with Daily

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,000
Harvest? And how did you guys decide to

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,680
set yourselves apart?

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,680
>> Yeah. So, at Daily Harvest, we like to

24
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,719
say we're real food made easy. Our our

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,719
founders's vision was I very certainly

26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,800
we could change the way food was grown

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,640
and the way people eat if we make it

28
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,199
easy for them. Um, at the end of the

29
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,280
day, organic fruits and vegetables are

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,600
the foundation of a healthy diet. And

31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,079
yet we all know that but there's this

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,000
friction built in. Um it doesn't taste

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,479
exactly as we want or we think about it

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,960
in some you know non-convenient

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,720
capacity. And so the early first

36
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,560
instinct was make a product that is

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,560
delicious. Make a product that is

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,400
convenient and our first founding

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,799
product. Our ready to blend smoothies

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,520
are still our number one product which

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,159
people love.

42
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,280
>> And on average how many grams of protein

43
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,880
does your smoothie have?

44
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,360
>> So we actually have a range of different

45
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,960
offerings. We are big believers in uh

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,320
for different parts of the day and

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,000
different nutritional needs. You're

48
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,320
going to have different needs. So, we

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,479
have a range of uh offerings, a range of

50
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,720
protein content, but we just launched

51
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,439
our what we like to call our our power

52
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,360
five. Uh it's uh smoothies with 20 grams

53
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,920
of plant-based protein. And we also

54
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,759
offer um our own organic single

55
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
ingredient pea protein. So, you can add

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,520
additional protein if you're looking for

57
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,680
it. Would you guys because animalbased

58
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,280
products are you know blowing up animal

59
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,880
based protein? It's obviously

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,399
bioavailable in a different way to

61
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,479
plant-based.

62
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,079
Do you see yourself as a market is

63
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,040
moving more towards that to integrate

64
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,799
more of that in?

65
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
>> So I think what's really interesting

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,840
about Daily Harvest is for our entire

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,000
time we've been based on organic fruits

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,160
and vegetables. We are

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,040
>> vegan products and yet we don't consider

70
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,920
ourselves a vegan brand. And so while we

71
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,239
explore different ways to make people uh

72
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,400
uh happy and healthy, we are certainly

73
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,640
open to the idea in the future um about

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,959
incorporating other nutritional

75
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
components including potentially dairy,

76
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,640
potentially meat in the future. As you

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,200
may know, we just were acquired by the

78
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,920
incredible business Jabbani who is built

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,280
on uh dairy as a great protein source.

80
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,120
So certainly something we'll look at in

81
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,720
the future. How did you guys

82
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,800
differentiate yourself in a market that

83
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,000
is so saturated with so many different

84
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920
brands coming out? Because you guys have

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,840
done an amazing job with your marketing,

86
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,440
brand messaging, stayed really authentic

87
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,680
and genuine. So, how did you guys do

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,800
that?

89
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,720
>> I mean, you just said it right.

90
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Authenticity is what matters maybe more

91
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,400
than anything these days for a brand to

92
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,239
be built successfully. We've always kept

93
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,319
it very simple. We've tried to make it

94
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
very clear what we are, what we stand

95
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,879
for, and how we make it easier for you

96
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,360
to get that foundational um you know,

97
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,519
nutrition each day. Um, we are daily

98
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,920
harvest. We encourage you to make one

99
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,680
simple choice each day and it starts

100
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,360
with breakfast or you know if you want

101
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,040
it to be dinner that works too but for

102
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,319
us breakfast is the foundation of a

103
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,920
healthy day.

104
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,920
>> Running a company in the health and

105
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,680
wellness space you know that has to do

106
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,080
with foods a lot of it comes down to

107
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,239
farming and stuff. What are some of the

108
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,440
biggest challenges being the CEO of this

109
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,680
company you faced?

110
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,239
>> You know we've never been shy to embrace

111
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,959
complexity. The American food system

112
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,319
unfortunately has prioritized, you know,

113
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,080
simplicity and scale and efficiency. Um,

114
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,400
if you really want to deliver a healthy

115
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
food system, one that uplift uplifts

116
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,159
nutritional value for the individual,

117
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,159
you know, livelihoods for farmers, you

118
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,560
have to lean into the complexity. And so

119
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,560
that complexity comes from biodiverse

120
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,560
ingredients that we source right from

121
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,920
all over the country. And some of those

122
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
ingredients coming from other parts of

123
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,080
the world. Building a supply chain that

124
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,480
can manage that complexity has probably

125
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,239
been the biggest challenge. Um, but we

126
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,439
built that into our DNA from the

127
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,480
beginning. We weren't going to shy away

128
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,560
from that.

129
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,120
>> Looking back at your journey with Daily

130
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
Harvest and being the CEO, has it been a

131
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
specific moment in time that was

132
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,840
probably one of your most difficult

133
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,720
decisions to make?

134
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,400
>> You know, I would say two two things

135
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,280
come to mind. The first was, you know,

136
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,280
the pandemic was a a massive accelerant

137
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,440
for the business, right? people were at

138
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,120
home. People were nervous and scared.

139
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,280
How am I going to get my food? We had

140
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
already had a, you know, a major

141
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,919
customer following and reaching out to

142
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
them and telling them, look, you're

143
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,120
scared right now, but we're here. We're

144
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,440
available and we're going to continue to

145
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,880
supply your food even at times we you

146
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,280
didn't we didn't know what was coming.

147
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,600
Um, but staying true to that and staying

148
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,759
connected to the consumer was the most

149
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
critical thing for us. The next was, you

150
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,240
know, we were a business built on the

151
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,639
direct to consumer model. Knowing that

152
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,120
it was time to also pivot into the

153
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,639
retail landscape to find more consumers

154
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,400
and meet them where they were was a big

155
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,320
change. You have an entire business

156
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,360
model, an entire organization designed

157
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,000
for one channel. How do you successfully

158
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,680
make that leap was a a a critical moment

159
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,280
for us and one we're still figuring out.

160
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
But I think those are two moments that

161
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,360
jump out to me. And looking at how

162
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
marketing has shifted and changed over

163
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,320
the years since when you guys started,

164
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,160
you went through the pandemic. You've

165
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,680
come out on the other side, what are

166
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,440
some of the biggest learnings when it

167
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,880
comes to being a health and wellness

168
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
brand. When it comes to how you're

169
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
approaching your marketing,

170
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,039
>> there's always going to be a new trend.

171
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
We see that time and time again in the

172
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,080
wellness category. Each and every year

173
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,240
there's a new one. Um, we try to be the

174
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
consistency in people's lives. Bring

175
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,240
them back to that foundation. And I

176
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
think you also have to, you know, pivot

177
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,600
and understand what people are looking

178
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,000
for. That that evolves over time. We're

179
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,720
living through a moment where more and

180
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,199
more awareness and focus on the food

181
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,199
system, the challenges that exist. Uh

182
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,120
people are looking for trusted voices.

183
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,280
And so we've started to inject more of

184
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,199
those trusted voices inhouse. You know,

185
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,520
our chef, our nutritionist, right? How

186
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,520
do we give them more of a direct voice

187
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,120
and a connection to the customer so the

188
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,440
customer doesn't see just marketing,

189
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,960
right? They see information that they

190
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,720
can trust and information that helps

191
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,880
guide decision making for them.

192
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,199
>> Do you guys do things which are seasonal

193
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,919
or you like just basically get stuff

194
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,319
throughout the year?

195
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,319
>> So the beauty of frozen, we like to say

196
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,720
we're frozen for a reason is because you

197
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,039
can uh pick ingredients at the peak of

198
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,800
their harvest so they're taste great and

199
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,120
they're the most nutritious and then

200
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,199
lock in all that nutrition u through the

201
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,120
freezing process, right? And so while we

202
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,199
will introduce seasonal flavors from

203
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,520
time to time, uh for example, our

204
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,440
pumpkin spice latte, which is

205
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,080
>> truly built on pumpkin, most of them

206
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,400
aren't. Um uh is a seasonal offering

207
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,280
that people love. That being said, our

208
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,840
organic fruits and vegetables uh come to

209
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,600
you on a daily basis, on a weekly basis,

210
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,240
all year round because of that freezing

211
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,000
process.

212
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,520
>> And where are you guys sourcing from?

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,440
Are you working in partnership with

214
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,840
specific farms? What does that look

215
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,440
like? Yeah. So, we source uh you know

216
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,199
across the country and we also source

217
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,880
certain things internationally as you

218
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,080
might know. We don't grow a lot of co

219
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,400
coconuts here in the US. Um but we love

220
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,560
to work as close and direct to the

221
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,880
source as possible. We have a number of

222
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,520
incredible partnerships uh with farmers

223
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,960
directly. Um there's a really um

224
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,400
incredible project I'm very proud of

225
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,080
called the Almond Project. We've worked

226
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,479
with our almond growers and a few other

227
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,240
brands to actually do a five-year study

228
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,479
on the impacts of regenerative and

229
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
organic agriculture for those farmers.

230
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,240
So, those are examples of where we'll go

231
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
above and beyond not just buying the

232
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,800
ingredient or procuring the ingredient,

233
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,960
but actually partnering with a farmer.

234
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,960
>> And when it comes to your personal daily

235
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,960
practices, how do you sustain energy

236
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,199
being, you know, a CEO running this like

237
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,599
scaling company? It helps to work at a

238
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,039
company that is based on organic fruits

239
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,160
and vegetables because I truly believe

240
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,879
that nutrition is the unlock.

241
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
>> Are you vegan?

242
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,639
>> I am not vegan. Okay.

243
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,599
>> Um but I eat a cherry almond smoothie

244
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,599
every morning. Um I add that scoop of uh

245
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,599
our organic pea protein powder and that

246
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,759
really gets me going. And I think for me

247
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,240
I've always been connected to food. My

248
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,319
background is actually in chemistry but

249
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,560
I was also a personal chef. And so I

250
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,800
have this sort of dual reality of

251
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,199
understanding the sciences and the sort

252
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
of the art at the same time.

253
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,039
>> Do you still work on any of the recipes

254
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
at the give feedback on some of the

255
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,520
>> Our head chef would love to tell me that

256
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,440
I don't I'm sure. No, I'm kidding. Um

257
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,519
but I I do love to be in the kitchen

258
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,760
with the team. I love to get in there.

259
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,200
We love to talk and taste. I mean, and I

260
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,120
think that's what's been true and unique

261
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,120
about Daily Harvest from the beginning,

262
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,839
>> you know, to work at a company that

263
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,519
everyone cares so deeply about the food.

264
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,600
You know, from eight years ago, I

265
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,519
remember sitting around uh the office

266
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,080
and actually making time to sit together

267
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,080
to eat. Eating at Daily Harvest wasn't

268
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,519
sort of a lunch break. It was an

269
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
opportunity to idate. It was an

270
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,120
opportunity to solve problems. And I

271
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,800
think that's what food has always done,

272
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,920
right? Food is a problem solving

273
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,080
dynamic. Exactly.

274
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,200
>> How big is the team? So, we're just over

275
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,279
50 people today.

276
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
>> Wow. And everybody's based in New York.

277
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,720
>> We're spread out. We've got a large New

278
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,760
York base, but we're also some remote

279
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,600
team members as well.

280
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,959
>> And how is that done for you guys? I I I

281
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,320
assume obviously marketing can be

282
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
remote. It doesn't really matter, but

283
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
everything when it comes to production

284
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,959
and all of that is based in New York.

285
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,320
>> Uh we work with great partners across

286
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,160
the country, right? We're direct to

287
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,680
consumer business first. Retail

288
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,560
recently, but so you have to get the

289
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,320
food to people. Um we are a frozen

290
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,320
direct to consumer business, which adds

291
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,000
its own complexity. So, we do have, you

292
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,360
know, operations spread out across the

293
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
country so people can get what they

294
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
need.

295
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,360
>> If you are taking protein powder, you

296
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,640
definitely need to hear this. The Clean

297
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,160
Label Project tested 160 different

298
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,360
proteins from different vendors and

299
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,040
brands across the US. And you're going

300
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,920
to be shocked at the discovery that they

301
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,160
made. Nearly half of the top selling

302
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,240
proteins in the US tested high for lead.

303
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,240
And if you're somebody who consumes

304
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,080
protein powders daily, this is something

305
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,640
you have to be concerned about. And to

306
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,040
make matters worse, most brands do not

307
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,240
value transparency and will not reveal

308
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,480
their test data online. And I want my

309
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,560
community like myself to always make an

310
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,120
informed choice of what they want to be

311
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,360
exposed to and how they consume their

312
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,360
daily protein. And that is why I love

313
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
Pure. I also sat down with the founder

314
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,040
and had a full honest transparent

315
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,120
conversation with him about how they

316
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,440
source, how they educate their consumer

317
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,279
and also what their products offer on

318
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,399
the market, which sets them apart. Their

319
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,839
Pure PW1 protein tastes absolutely

320
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,920
exceptional and you know you're not

321
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,680
getting the gunk of heavy metals in it

322
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,200
to start your morning with. And that is

323
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,040
why I absolutely love Pur's PW1 whey

324
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
protein and that is how I choose to

325
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,279
start my day every morning. Every single

326
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,120
batch is third-party tested by the Clean

327
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,680
Label Project. And no product is ever

328
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,920
sold unless it passes these tests. And

329
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,720
Purey is one of the only brands in the

330
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,800
US that has the Clean Label product

331
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,880
certification on their products. And

332
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,360
that is only possible because they make

333
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,279
all their third party testing completely

334
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,440
transparently available to the consumer

335
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,279
through a QR code where you can track

336
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,880
the exact journey of the batch of

337
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,360
product that you're purchasing. So you

338
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,839
guys can see for yourself exactly how

339
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,000
clean the PW1 that you're consuming in

340
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,760
the morning is. Every single serving

341
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,560
gives you 21 g of minimally processed

342
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,640
high quality bioavailable protein. It

343
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,839
comes from pasture-raised

344
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,680
cows. No GMOs, no hormones, no

345
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,000
herbicides, no pesticides, and

346
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,680
definitely no heavy metals. So, this

347
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
means I can start my day with

348
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,000
confidence, knowing I'm having something

349
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,000
super clean to support my skeletal

350
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,720
muscle mass. My personal favorite flavor

351
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,120
is a Berber and vanilla. No artificial

352
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,760
flavors and no funky aftertaste. To make

353
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,600
sure your daily protein powder is not

354
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,200
hiding any nasty chemicals, and they're

355
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
not being open and transparent with you.

356
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,480
So, if you want something clean,

357
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,240
delicious, and bioavailable with

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,800
I'm a big believer if you don't measure

367
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,079
it, you're not going to know how to fix

368
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,720
it. I do a lot of own sort of personal

369
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,560
monitoring of my activity. Rather than

370
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,360
set sort of an aggressive goal for

371
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,040
productivity, I really take stock in

372
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
what I've been doing each week, each

373
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,200
month, even something like exercise. We

374
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,079
all know exercise is really critical as

375
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,639
a foundation, but rather than maybe have

376
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,920
an aggressive goal that I can't reach, I

377
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,000
actually just measure how many days did

378
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,760
I get active this week? How many days

379
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,079
did I get active this month? And that

380
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,839
helps set a foundation and a baseline.

381
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,160
And most importantly, I always tell

382
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,000
people, you have to trust how you feel,

383
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,440
right? There's a lot of hacks out there,

384
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,639
a lot of measurables, a lot of

385
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,160
wearables, which I totally support. But

386
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,160
if you don't just take stock and pause

387
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,079
and say, "How did I feel today after

388
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,920
doing X, Y, and Z?" You're never going

389
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,680
to really be able to fully embrace the

390
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,680
full capacity of yourself

391
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,399
>> when it comes to your whole like farm to

392
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,680
freeze organics, right? How does that

393
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,720
set you apart from some of your

394
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,959
competitors?

395
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,440
>> So, look, organic fruits and vegetables

396
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,360
is not easy, right? In fact, there's a

397
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,120
growing demand still for organics in

398
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,680
this country. And yet, we're seeing more

399
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,240
and more farmland move away from organic

400
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,480
agriculture. It's complex. There is a

401
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,880
cost to it. And so, we've really

402
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,680
attempted to stay true to that belief

403
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,959
that what is hard is hard for a reason.

404
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,120
And we've got to make it easier for

405
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,959
people to make those decisions. So, I

406
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,600
think a lot of brands when they go to

407
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,399
look for more consumers, they start to

408
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,320
trade away their values. Um, you know,

409
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,480
the food system, as I said earlier,

410
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,720
largely built on one that is looking to

411
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,800
get sort of the the most efficient

412
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,519
calories to consumers. We've always

413
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,440
taken the the harder path, which I think

414
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,480
will, you know, keep us strong in the

415
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,399
long run.

416
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,000
>> And has anything like, you know, when

417
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,600
there is a problem with food shortage

418
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
or, you know, a certain item goes out of

419
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,040
price, how do you guys factor that into

420
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
your pricing? Are you raising prices on

421
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,079
certain products? Are you just swapping

422
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,120
out the recipes? Like, how do you adjust

423
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,680
for that? From as a business

424
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,279
perspective,

425
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,600
>> we've got a fair amount of variety in

426
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,760
our food offerings. And so we try really

427
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,399
not hard not to sort of pass any of

428
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,160
those challenges on to consumers, right?

429
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,920
Different ingredients are going to have

430
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,240
different markets each year, different

431
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,079
pricing each year, but we try to build a

432
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,760
business that that is somewhat blind to

433
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,920
the consumer, right? In the same way

434
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Rachel started the business to keep it

435
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,519
easy for people, we try to keep it easy

436
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,639
still. Um, we don't want you thinking

437
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
about those things. We want you to be

438
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,160
able to successfully make that good

439
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,399
choice for you each and every day.

440
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
>> And when Rachel started the company, did

441
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,680
she think the direction it's heading in

442
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,240
now, this would this is where it would

443
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,519
be, or has the market dictated a lot of

444
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,120
different things along the way?

445
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,880
>> One thing that Rachel instilled in me in

446
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,720
early days when I joined, as I said, my

447
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,639
my job was to help operationalize her

448
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,000
vision. Um,

449
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,160
>> so much of what she believed in was

450
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,399
listen to your consumers. Um, the direct

451
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,800
to consumer model is really unique in

452
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,560
that you have this very direct line to

453
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,160
consumers. So if you allow them, they're

454
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,320
going to give you information that helps

455
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,600
you guide decision-m. So we've really

456
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,320
adopted a strategy listening to listen

457
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,760
to the consumers, make great products,

458
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,440
help them solve different challenges

459
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,800
throughout the day, and yeah, be willing

460
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
to pivot. Not everything's going to

461
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,279
work, right?

462
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,680
>> And I think that's the the hardest thing

463
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,279
for businesses is, you know, do you

464
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,959
become so riskaverse because you're

465
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,199
afraid something will fail or do you

466
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,120
build a culture that allows you to try

467
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,839
things and if it doesn't work, you move

468
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,519
on. which was thinking back like being

469
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,279
the CEO of this company, what was one of

470
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,800
the biggest risks that you took that you

471
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,320
didn't know where it would go but it

472
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,560
worked out?

473
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,880
>> Fascinating question. Yeah, I think you

474
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,839
know when we think about some of the

475
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,600
latest offerings we've introduced um and

476
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,160
we think about sort of being able to

477
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,639
connect to an entirely new audience,

478
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,320
we've started doing a range of more

479
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,079
curated uh orders. Um, we've been a

480
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,600
company built on a subscription model

481
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,279
almost from the beginning.

482
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,000
>> Allowing people to move away from

483
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,040
subscription is a business risk, right?

484
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,199
>> Yeah, of course. Huge.

485
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,480
>> Um, but that's what consumers are

486
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,360
looking for. And so, we've started to uh

487
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,800
create and offer um ways to purchase

488
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,399
Daily Harvest without it. Obviously,

489
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,079
retail is a huge way to do that without

490
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,920
a subscription, but there's a lot more

491
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,279
to come on this. So, I'm excited for

492
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,199
consumers in the next couple of months

493
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,120
to see what we've got cooking. And when

494
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,639
you say retail, do you see more people

495
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
still wanting to walk into our brick and

496
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,880
mortar and pick up their Daily Harvest?

497
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,120
>> This data changes regularly, but about

498
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,199
15% of consumers want to buy food

499
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,959
online. That means there's 85% of the

500
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,720
consumers who still want to go to the

501
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,399
grocery store. And so we've got to meet

502
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,000
consumers where they are. We've got to

503
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,600
be able to have the right offerings at

504
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
the right price for different target

505
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
audiences. But, you know, retail is a

506
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,040
big big opportunity for us still.

507
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,240
>> And when it comes to retail, who do you

508
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,680
guys see yourself partnering with?

509
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,480
Because every business has its own

510
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,639
model, right? Yeah.

511
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,640
>> So, do you see yourself being with the

512
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,439
Whole Foods or the Airwarms? Like, where

513
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,039
do you see yourself?

514
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,799
>> So, before joining Daily Harvest, I was

515
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,959
with a company called Vit Coco,

516
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,760
>> the leader in coconut waterconut.

517
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,400
>> Um, I love what they've been successful

518
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,880
at, which is you actually can win in all

519
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,199
retailers. It might look like slightly

520
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,799
different offerings across the way, but

521
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,000
that's a brand that works in Whole Foods

522
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,360
and works in Walmart. Yeah,

523
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,600
>> you know, my aspirations for Daily

524
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,919
Harvest is that we're making healthy,

525
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,360
accessible food based on organic fruits

526
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,760
and vegetables everywhere.

527
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,480
>> Right. Also, I think it's so interesting

528
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,080
you have a background as a chef. So,

529
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
what foods do you recommend which are

530
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,360
incredible for focus and mental clarity?

531
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,280
>> So, I know it's a it's a moment right

532
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,440
now and it's the moment that's long been

533
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,640
we've all been waiting for is this focus

534
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,200
on fiber. Um, right. The fiber maxing

535
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,799
conversation is finally hit. But I it's

536
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,240
so funny, right? Because protein is what

537
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
we always hear about, right, all the

538
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,120
time.

539
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,520
>> But actually feeling full and having

540
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,000
satiety is what ultimately gives you

541
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,440
energy, allows you to focus, you know,

542
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,360
really allows you to level up your

543
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,679
performance. And I think what people are

544
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,080
starting to really grasp on is things

545
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,080
like sugars, things like proteins,

546
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,679
things like carbohydrates are better

547
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,440
absorbed and better actually uh enablers

548
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,600
if you have the fiber with it,

549
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,200
>> right? And when it comes to things such

550
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,440
as food and energy, what do you think

551
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,840
most people completely get wrong?

552
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,760
>> So, I think people are looking for one,

553
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,640
a quick fix, and I I think

554
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
>> in everything in life.

555
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,760
>> Yeah, that's true. But I also think that

556
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,919
you it's easy to sort of lose sight of

557
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,520
the longer run. And I brought this back

558
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,360
up when I was talking about my own sort

559
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,039
of management of my exercise routine,

560
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,360
right? I try really hard not to get too

561
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,600
locked into one day or one week, but try

562
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,600
to build up those sort of habits over

563
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,520
time. We like to say like start with

564
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,760
breakfast, right? Don't skip breakfast,

565
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,360
please. Breakfast is so important. But

566
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,720
if you get that one choice right, and

567
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,640
that's why we're so focused at Daily

568
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,039
Harvest on whether it's our smoothies or

569
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
our oat bowls, allowing you to make one

570
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,559
easy decision out of the gate that

571
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,919
really sets the stage for your nutrition

572
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,760
throughout the day.

573
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,840
>> When you think of breakfast, what do you

574
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,840
advise people to like how do they pair

575
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,679
your your product? So, if it's if they

576
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,280
want more than just the smoothie, what

577
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,080
else do you suggest they pair it with?

578
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,679
>> Yeah. So, you know, a smoothie with some

579
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,960
protein powder. That's going to get you

580
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,080
pretty much everything you need in the

581
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,640
morning. But if you want a little bit

582
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,919
more than that, like have a couple eggs,

583
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,679
for example, right? Right. Maybe

584
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,280
something else. Maybe obviously a great

585
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
piece of sourdough toast. You got to

586
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,039
trust yourself. Um, and that's why I

587
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,440
love to tell people, you know, we want

588
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,320
nutrition to be this sort of zero or one

589
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,160
binary game, but nutrition is so much a

590
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,559
personal reality of how you feel, how

591
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,480
you react to things. Um, and so I I try

592
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,240
not to be too prescriptive because at

593
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,520
the end of the day, what people what

594
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,200
works for them may be different than

595
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,280
what someone works for someone else.

596
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,039
>> And for a business that does rely on a

597
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,799
supply chain that's sometimes out of

598
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:59,360
your control, farmers, what's available,

599
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,200
you know, what can actually be sourced?

600
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,799
How do you recover from like high stress

601
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,480
environments or like high stress

602
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,240
situations or setbacks that may take

603
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,840
place you personally? Yeah, on a

604
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,320
personal level, this is something I've

605
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,000
really I think had had a tremendous

606
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,440
amount of experience with, right,

607
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,320
leading a company is certainly

608
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,400
stressful. I really try to step away and

609
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,280
do something completely different than

610
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,679
the day-to-day. And honestly, it sounds

611
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,880
a little bit like old school, but going

612
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,360
out and doing something for your

613
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
community is an incredible way to get

614
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,960
away from what you were just dealing

615
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,480
with stress-wise. I think we all know

616
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,240
that feeling when you give back or when

617
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,159
you help someone, and that could be

618
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,600
literally anything. It could be tutoring

619
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,840
someone in your neighborhood. It could

620
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,440
be going to a food bank and support. It

621
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,880
could be showing up to support the high

622
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,880
school football team. Like whatever it

623
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
is, I think when you're in community and

624
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,919
when you're giving back, it's a great

625
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,360
way to create some perspective for

626
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,120
yourself because if you're just

627
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,880
grinding, if you're just in it, you're

628
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,559
sort of stewing over the the stress or

629
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
the issue or the the setback. To your

630
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,440
point, I don't think you ever really

631
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,880
find the space and time to think through

632
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,039
how you got there and where you're going

633
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,000
to be in the future.

634
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,960
How for somebody listening can they you

635
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,880
know and they want to start their own

636
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,640
business and they want to build it. How

637
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,240
do they build culture while at the same

638
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,520
time as scaling in the earlier days

639
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,760
because in the early days about growth

640
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,840
growth growth growth growth how do you

641
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,280
instill culture with that and what does

642
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,679
that culture maybe look like?

643
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,960
>> I think one of the the maybe strongest

644
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
leadership lessons I've personally

645
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,360
learned and I really try to instill for

646
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,120
the team and push my leaders that you

647
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,640
know work within the company to exude as

648
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,640
well is is be yourself. like you you

649
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,000
have a world, a life, a reality outside

650
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
of the company you're building,

651
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,640
>> right?

652
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,320
>> I think some leaders think that in order

653
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,640
to get everything out of their team to

654
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,720
build and to grow, you need to be solely

655
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,840
focused on the task at hand, the

656
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,200
organization, right?

657
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,120
>> But you as a human is uh the best way to

658
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
get people motivated to work for you. If

659
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,799
you display elements of what you care

660
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,080
about outside of the job, people are

661
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,840
going to get to know you more. They're

662
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,600
going to think of you more as that

663
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,960
human, not just the leader of the

664
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,559
organization, and they're going to think

665
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,559
about ways that they can drive even more

666
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,799
value for the organization and maybe

667
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,880
open up more about themselves that allow

668
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,440
you to then lead that individual even

669
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,200
better.

670
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,320
>> How have you been doing that personally

671
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,120
for your team?

672
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,039
>> So, um, uh, in the last 10 years or so,

673
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,880
I've become a average drummer, uh, in a

674
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,600
really fun band in New York City. I play

675
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,960
for a band called Our Lady of Sorrows

676
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,600
and I have made a point to be uh very

677
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,120
open about that internally even to the

678
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,760
>> How often do you do you play with the

679
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,520
with the band?

680
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,440
>> So I have an electric drum kit in the

681
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,159
office. I you know we play fairly

682
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
frequently in in New York City. Um and

683
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,360
that makes a huge difference for me.

684
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,440
It's a great personal outlet like a

685
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,520
creative outlet. But also again, just

686
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,280
sort of being very vocal about that and

687
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,880
some of the other components of my life

688
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,080
have allowed the team to get to know me

689
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,799
in a way that maybe they wouldn't

690
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,400
otherwise.

691
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,960
>> Do you think you're type A?

692
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,840
>> Oh man, I'm I'm certainly type A in a

693
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,039
lot of ways. Um, but I I try to round

694
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,440
that out uh

695
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,240
>> in in the creative ways with stuff.

696
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,120
>> Yes.

697
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,919
>> How do you distill between pushing your

698
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,360
team to do more and allowing time not

699
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,200
only for yourself but also for the team

700
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,360
for recovery? I struggle with that at

701
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,440
times. Yeah, it's really hard. I think I

702
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,320
I often talk about the values I I try to

703
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,039
instill and sort of foster the most in

704
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,919
the team is a sense of curiosity first

705
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,520
and foremost. Um that idea when I'm

706
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,600
taking a look around and I'm going

707
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,440
people are maybe showing up with less

708
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,679
questions, maybe there's a little bit

709
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,840
too much focus on, you know, the

710
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,919
day-to-day. We're losing that curiosity.

711
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,760
That's a signal to me that, okay, we got

712
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,200
to pause and take a step back. How do we

713
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,320
again maybe instill a sense of reset for

714
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,400
the organization? It's amazing

715
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,159
what that will do for you. If your

716
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
people are not showing up in a curious

717
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,799
and sort of creative fashion, it means

718
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,440
something's wrong,

719
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,440
>> right? And when you say curiosity, is

720
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,600
that in their role? Is that on the

721
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,120
growth of the company? Is that to do

722
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,120
with market trends and what's going on

723
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,840
in the space? I think it it comes down

724
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,159
to, you know, within their role, within

725
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,159
the individual's responsibilities, how

726
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,000
are they showing up with their tasks,

727
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,880
with their effort, with their strategy,

728
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,480
you know, are they asking questions that

729
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,400
>> tell you that they're really thinking

730
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,159
about what their responsibilities are in

731
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,840
a way that is like this is not just

732
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,600
about getting it right today. This is

733
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,000
really about, you know, sustaining for

734
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,000
the future and coming up with new ideas.

735
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,080
Um, and so it's going to manifest in

736
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,840
different ways, but you know, curiosity

737
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,000
and conviction are the two things. If

738
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,760
you show up to me and you present great

739
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,520
idea and you show, hey, I've thought

740
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,520
about two or three different approaches

741
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,120
here, but I've got this one that I'm

742
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,240
recommending, that tells me you're

743
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,919
really engaged. If you look back at so

744
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,919
far all the marketing campaigns and all

745
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,000
that you've done, what was one of the

746
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,760
most successful marketing initiatives

747
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,520
you guys launched for Daily Harvest that

748
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,880
really

749
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,919
maybe you weren't expecting the return

750
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,120
on investment, but it was like

751
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,279
completely blown you away?

752
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,360
>> So, I think we have there's two things I

753
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,200
would say. One, and we've always felt

754
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,120
this way. If you can just try Daily

755
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,520
Harvest, you're going to be hooked. I

756
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,320
think um for a frozen direct to consumer

757
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,919
business, finding ways to sample our

758
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,240
food has been challenging. Yeah, of

759
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,159
course.

760
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,240
>> And so what we've been really successful

761
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,039
out of late is finding a couple of key

762
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,520
partners that share similar values and

763
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,679
want to have Daily Harvest available and

764
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,480
accessible for their community. That may

765
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,200
not be in a traditional sort of retail

766
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,120
setting. It may be much more in a you

767
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,960
know um there's this community that

768
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,320
gathers each and every week or each and

769
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,760
every month. How do we have our food

770
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,080
there? How do we integrate ourselves

771
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,679
into that organization? Again, it's a

772
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,679
different version of sampling, but I

773
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,080
think it makes a huge difference. The

774
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,640
other is I just think people want to be

775
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,440
told very clearly the value and the

776
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,240
impact the food can have um we've

777
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,760
>> on their lives.

778
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,559
>> Yeah. We we've had a lot of really

779
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,120
success recently with the concept of a a

780
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,440
reset or a detox, right? People want

781
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,440
that opportunity to eat healthy every

782
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,200
day, but we all know how hard that is,

783
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,520
right? You've been traveling or been

784
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,880
very busy at home. you know, how do I

785
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,720
take a couple days to reset myself? And

786
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,919
you know, for us, not to to knock any of

787
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,520
the other offerings that are out there,

788
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,360
a lot of those thing, you know, those

789
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,679
offerings that exist in the detox sense

790
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,760
are are sort of like very restrictive,

791
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,840
right? Basically, don't eat for 48 hours

792
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,679
and you you'll be reset, right?

793
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,679
>> For us, it's no actually

794
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,679
>> eat and be rooted in healthy foundation,

795
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,799
you know, food based on organic fruits

796
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,360
and vegetables. I keep saying it, but

797
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,679
it's who we are. Um, and that is a sort

798
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,679
of incredible reset for the system. I

799
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,039
feel it if I go travel for work or

800
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,960
>> and then you come back and kind of do

801
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,000
>> I am craving it at that point. I crave a

802
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,520
couple days.

803
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,039
>> When it comes to community events, can

804
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,080
you give us examples of ones that have

805
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,240
been successful and how have you done

806
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,159
that because it is frozen, right? So, is

807
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,080
it dethawing and having stuff available

808
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,840
as tasters or, you know?

809
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,320
>> Yeah. So, I think we've there's a few

810
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,159
different spaces. I you know we've had a

811
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,880
lot of success building longer term

812
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,760
relationships with you know uh wellness

813
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,279
and sort of um exercise partners right

814
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,880
people that hold you know exercise

815
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,799
classes or have their own communities

816
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,440
maybe it's a run club or maybe it's an

817
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,279
exercise studio how do we do events with

818
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,640
them in a way that brings the food on

819
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,799
site our team will come and blend

820
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,559
smoothies for you right um and actually

821
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,640
show up and be a part of the community

822
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,559
versus it just sort of feeling like this

823
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,919
giveaway right you know standing outside

824
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,440
the subway and handing

825
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,200
>> totally you know, a granola bar. Sure,

826
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,880
that that's what sampling used to be.

827
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,120
But for us, it's about really showing up

828
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,360
inside communities. Another interesting

829
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,559
one is, you know, my wife uh actually

830
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,840
rides in um uh the equestrian world and

831
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,080
the show jumping world. And that's a

832
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,000
community that is constantly rushing

833
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,400
around, busy, busy, busy, and almost

834
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,400
nutrition is sort of a second. Exactly.

835
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,000
And so we've had a really strong

836
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,080
partnership with some of the events

837
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,240
where we actually show up and again make

838
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,559
our food available for people and the

839
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,399
the stop and pause moment that you watch

840
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,919
people have to say, "Oh my god, this is

841
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,120
exactly what I need

842
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,279
>> right now to get me going." Yeah.

843
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,679
>> To get me going or to recover and and

844
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,360
also again being there as a source of of

845
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,120
information more than just food I would

846
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,559
say are the strongest examples.

847
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,919
>> Do you guys look at like nutritional

848
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,279
studies that are coming out constantly

849
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,000
because you said you have a nutritionist

850
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,520
on on this on the team as well. Are you

851
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,039
guys looking at research and trying to

852
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,480
pair different recipes according to

853
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,440
research that's coming out or if

854
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,960
something is supposed to be really good

855
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,799
for you, do you incorporate it in?

856
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,279
>> Yeah, I mean a great example of that is

857
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,320
we all know the sort of you know uh sort

858
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,919
of expansion of GLP1s as you know a

859
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,600
medicine that many are taking now.

860
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,399
Whatever the latest that is, it's always

861
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,880
astonishing to me. um we actually have

862
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:41,440
been able to curate a companion set for

863
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,520
GLP-1 consumers that it's more important

864
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,440
than ever to get the levels of protein,

865
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,039
the level of nutrient density. You

866
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,960
mentioned that up front and so our

867
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,279
nutritionists work to actually create a

868
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,919
curation sort of companion set for

869
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,080
consumers. Um so we're always looking at

870
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,200
what's happening both from a trend and a

871
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,880
science perspective. Um, it is, again, I

872
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,399
keep saying it, but because we're based

873
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,480
off of this sort of like first

874
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,000
principles, triedand-true belief that,

875
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,000
you know, organic fruits and vegetables

876
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,840
are the healthy starting point, there's

877
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,559
not a tremendous amount of new science

878
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,360
on that because it is it is the core.

879
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,720
>> What are what does the GLP1 set include?

880
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,679
>> So, u, we've had a few different

881
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,440
offerings, but we try to uh make our

882
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,039
sort of a subset of our food available

883
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,039
throughout the day so you can make sure

884
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,960
you're getting the level of nutrients

885
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,720
you need. So that could be a number of

886
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,559
our meals that you'll have either for

887
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,240
lunch or dinner. Some of our smoothies

888
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,760
are really perfect companions because

889
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,440
you are getting the calories, the

890
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
protein, and the fiber that you need.

891
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,679
Um, and so we're just always looking at

892
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,880
our portfolio and making sure that the

893
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,039
the proportions of, you know, delivery

894
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,960
from a nutrient perspective are there

895
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,120
>> is always there. How do you make

896
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,840
difficult decisions under pressure?

897
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,520
>> So there's actually a framework that I

898
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,760
adopted a few years ago that I

899
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,679
absolutely love. It's called the Canvan

900
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,240
framework and there's sort of breaks

901
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,799
apart decision-m through two lenses. Are

902
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,480
you living in a predictable world or an

903
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,559
unpredictable world? And how repeatable

904
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,159
is the challenge you're dealing with?

905
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,080
The reason I've loved this is because I

906
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,080
watched a few years ago the the pandemic

907
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,640
was a great example where you know what

908
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,720
I felt was like a very high performing

909
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,039
operations team. We started to make

910
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,600
decisions in a way that felt sort of

911
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,279
inconsistent, right? And this framework

912
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,520
helped me realize like it was because we

913
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,080
went from this highly predictable

914
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,080
>> moment to a highly unpredictable moment.

915
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,760
And there's really great ways to help

916
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,159
people move from back from the

917
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,399
unpredictable to predictable. How do you

918
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,559
make small experiments that help guide

919
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,240
your confidence in your conviction in

920
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,679
the next step? How do you think about

921
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,919
things through the lens of is this a

922
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,520
two-way door or a one-way door? It's my

923
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,679
other favorite phrase, right? If you go

924
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,799
through

925
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,679
>> what does that mean? The two-way door

926
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,600
versus oneway door.

927
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,799
>> Two-way door. you can go forward and

928
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,080
then you can go back, right? That's a

929
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,279
decision that you can reverse or

930
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,200
sometimes you'll hear people say a

931
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,880
reversible decision or an irreversible

932
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,440
decision. There are some that you're

933
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,640
making that leap and that's it. And so

934
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,159
in when you're living in that more

935
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,679
unpredictable time,

936
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,840
>> I I would say you lean more into

937
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,440
experimentation. When you're living in

938
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,520
more of that predictable, you really

939
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,399
lean into best practices and getting it

940
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,000
done. I feel like we I think there

941
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,120
always has to be when you're a founder

942
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,640
or a CEO of a company, there has to be

943
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,039
just the right amount of pressure that

944
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,600
is applied to the team at all times.

945
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,440
>> Yes.

946
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,880
>> For them to see what their growth

947
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,240
potential could be. Otherwise, people

948
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,960
get like almost like complacent, you

949
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,039
know, in a way.

950
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,919
>> I'm a I'm a because of my chemistry

951
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,919
background. Yeah.

952
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,159
>> I talk about experimentation all the

953
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,880
time.

954
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,320
>> All the time.

955
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,480
>> But I think what's interesting, a lot of

956
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,360
people talk about experiments and fail

957
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,919
fast. I hate that phrase, fail fast. Who

958
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,919
wants to fail? To me, it's about how

959
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,000
quickly can you learn? How quickly can

960
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,120
you gain the insight you're looking for

961
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,440
>> and land on your feet?

962
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,200
>> Exactly. And I think the one other thing

963
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,440
I think companies get wrong,

964
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,000
particularly when they're early on and

965
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,840
challenged and capital constrained, you

966
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
know, they you do a lot of experiments,

967
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,039
but then you look back and you go, did

968
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,360
we even really set the experiment up for

969
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,440
success? And then what did you make the

970
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,519
draw the wrong conclusion? And so what

971
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,559
we try to do at the company now is is

972
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,320
really focus on defining the experiment,

973
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,720
ensuring we all agree that we are

974
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,760
setting it up to succeed knowing that in

975
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,880
two weeks it might get a little

976
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,159
uncomfortable if we're not seeing

977
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,200
exactly want to see

978
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,559
>> but this is an experiment that's going

979
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,159
to take eight weeks. We better give it

980
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,760
its full eight weeks of potential.

981
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,679
>> Can you give us an example of an

982
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,159
experiment like that that you ran as a

983
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,279
team?

984
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,120
>> So of late, you know, this sort of uh uh

985
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,200
subscription versus not subscription is

986
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,039
a great example, right? allowing

987
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,600
consumers the flexibility that they

988
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,039
clearly have been asking for, right, is

989
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,760
a nerve-wracking, challenging shift to

990
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,600
the team.

991
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,880
>> Your revenue completely shifts.

992
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,480
>> Exactly. How you predict, how you

993
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,120
forecast, right? How do I know how much

994
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,720
food to make, how much food to buy? Um,

995
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,640
but we know it's the right thing. And so

996
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,960
we're setting up the experiments in a

997
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,399
way that allow us to learn to manage the

998
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,399
risk appropriately, and then to iterate.

999
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,919
And when you are taking people off these

1000
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,279
subscription models from a financial

1001
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,200
perspective because you touched on it

1002
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,039
briefly, how are you guys covering

1003
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,320
yourself? Because there can be some

1004
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,600
months that are great and some months

1005
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,120
that are not so great.

1006
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,120
>> I think that's what I meant by setting

1007
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,960
up experiments. You know, one that you

1008
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,640
can manage the risk, right? Okay. You

1009
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,240
know, there are some things that, you

1010
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,159
know, businesses will have to just make

1011
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,440
big leaps of faith on. There are other

1012
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,360
things, you know, like this, for

1013
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,600
example, or new products we may want to

1014
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,919
offer or new marketing channels we want

1015
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,919
to enter where there's ways to carve out

1016
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,279
the appropriate amount of risk to learn

1017
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,760
until you're, you know, you're really

1018
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,840
there. You know, the classic online

1019
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,159
version of this is AB testing, right? To

1020
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,600
really try to validate, but you can't AB

1021
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,240
test everything.

1022
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,799
>> What is your one big marketing no where

1023
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,399
you think brands waste their money?

1024
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:55,120
>> H, great question. I I feel like it's

1025
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,399
not necessarily one thing. It's more,

1026
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,840
you know, getting caught up in just

1027
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,360
doing something for the sake of doing

1028
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,000
something. I think kind of first

1029
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,080
principles rule for me is, you know, is

1030
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,240
is something we're doing in service of

1031
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,320
the greater mission. Are we actually

1032
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,839
getting to new consumers? Are we

1033
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,480
strengthening the relationship with the

1034
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,399
existing? Um, a good example of this for

1035
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,079
us, and this is not true for for every

1036
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,399
business, but I'll just give a real life

1037
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,639
Daily Harvest example is it's so easy to

1038
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,480
think about sort of like college

1039
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,119
campuses as an opportunity.

1040
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,839
>> Yeah. And yet,

1041
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,240
>> of course,

1042
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,320
>> we're a frozen brand,

1043
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,440
>> freezer space is limited, right? So,

1044
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,679
there are certain times where you just

1045
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,000
go, okay, there are audiences, there are

1046
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,919
interested parties, but is that really

1047
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
going to be a truly

1048
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,599
>> perfect fit for us? I mean, trust me, if

1049
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,320
you're out there at college, we've got

1050
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,839
a, you know, uh, educate education

1051
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,520
discount for you. I'm not I'm not

1052
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,200
telling you not to eat Daily Harvest,

1053
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,960
but I recognize that's probably not the

1054
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,760
best place for us to focus our energy,

1055
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,119
>> right? Which place have you seen the

1056
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,200
most growth? Is it like young

1057
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,800
millennials? Is it older millennials? Is

1058
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,320
it Gen Z's? Like, where have you seen

1059
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,960
the most market adoptability?

1060
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,280
>> Busy moms, right? Busy families, busy

1061
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
parents, right? people that are that

1062
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,599
understand look taking care of their

1063
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,760
children in particular is the the first

1064
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,040
number one priority but you can't really

1065
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
do that if you don't take care of

1066
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,320
yourself right

1067
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,839
>> and I think we see so much adoption and

1068
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,760
so much uh enthusiasm from parent

1069
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,079
audiences who are just looking for that

1070
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,760
easy choice make one a day right start

1071
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,359
your day with something healthy like

1072
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,119
Daily Harvest and it sets the entire

1073
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,720
tone for everything else

1074
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,119
>> being a CEO in the health and wellness

1075
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,839
space where do you think longevity is

1076
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,440
headed So longevity right now is all the

1077
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,240
craze, right? People are thinking about

1078
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,599
longevity. For me, I you know, I I think

1079
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,839
about this through the lens both on a

1080
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,560
personal level, right? How do you

1081
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,839
leverage the expanded opport you know,

1082
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,000
information that's out there both

1083
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,839
around, you know, things that work for

1084
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,359
everyone and then more importantly

1085
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,839
things that work for you, right?

1086
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,640
>> I feel very strongly, like I said, every

1087
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,119
day is a a data collection opportunity

1088
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,280
for yourself. Again, the wearables are

1089
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,720
certainly ways to accelerate that, but

1090
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,560
how do you just stay really true and in

1091
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,560
tune to yourself and how you're feeling

1092
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,880
physically and mentally? I think

1093
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,920
ultimately what we will see over time is

1094
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,000
the more sort of grounded and and happy

1095
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,240
we're allowed to be is probably the

1096
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,800
greatest sign for longevity

1097
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,400
opportunities. But look, life is hard.

1098
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,560
You know, it's very complicated for

1099
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,800
people uh in a world that we live in

1100
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,240
like today to to to make it easy. So, we

1101
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,040
just try to inject a little bit of that

1102
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,560
easiness and joy into every every day.

1103
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,320
>> I think if you're fueling yourself

1104
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,520
correctly and you're getting adequate

1105
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,720
amounts of sleep, but even if you're not

1106
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,720
getting the sleep, but you're fueling

1107
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,160
yourself correctly, when those daily

1108
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,520
stressors show up in your life and you

1109
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,880
want to squirm under it, when you're

1110
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,800
fueled correctly, your brain works

1111
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,240
better, your hormones are firing better,

1112
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,320
you have a little bit more peace in your

1113
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,119
life. So, how you react to that stress

1114
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,440
is easier.

1115
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,680
>> Look, and stress, I think, is, you know,

1116
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,000
the the stress and inflammation, right?

1117
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,640
I think are the the two greatest

1118
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,480
>> uh you know impact issues of our time

1119
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,800
and they're directly connected and I

1120
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,320
think on a personal level I can say

1121
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,160
there are times where you go through a

1122
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,000
long you know r you know window of

1123
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,920
stress and you don't even realize how

1124
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,160
resilient your body and your mind are

1125
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,520
you're just absorbing it over and over

1126
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,440
and over basically

1127
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,560
>> and when you finally get a chance to

1128
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,960
release it

1129
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,520
>> you physically feel how much you've been

1130
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,440
carrying and so I think what I've

1131
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,640
learned in my life is Don't overestimate

1132
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,400
the power of talking to people in and

1133
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,760
out of the company about what you're

1134
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,280
dealing with. Correct. I think there's a

1135
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,640
sense as a leader like you're not

1136
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,560
supposed to be stressed. You're not

1137
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,000
supposed to be challenged, right?

1138
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,920
Particularly CEOs, it's like this

1139
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,760
notorious like admitting your stress

1140
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,079
would be some sort of sign of weakness,

1141
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,720
right?

1142
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,440
>> I have found the greatest strength in

1143
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,200
talking with friends, family, strangers,

1144
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,200
right, in community just about what's

1145
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,960
going on. It's amazing what you realize.

1146
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,480
>> So, you're extroverted. I'm definitely

1147
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,160
an extrovert, which is a benefit,

1148
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,599
>> which is amazing. You know, that's also

1149
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,520
for me being a founder and I'm obviously

1150
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,800
building two businesses. Me just

1151
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,560
connecting to somebody and I can

1152
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,000
energetically feed off them and be like,

1153
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,760
"Oh, my problem is solved. I feel so

1154
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,400
much better about this. I vented. I got

1155
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,480
what I needed."

1156
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,800
>> Often times, just saying it out loud or

1157
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,320
writing it down. You know, there are

1158
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,160
times I've been an introvert in my life.

1159
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,839
I would say I have found that writing is

1160
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,119
a really powerful way to get to the same

1161
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,119
challenge, the same outcome, I should

1162
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,640
say. You know, hey, what am I thinking

1163
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,040
about? How am I navigating that?

1164
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,720
digesting it in in the written form um

1165
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,520
is a really powerful way to get it out

1166
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,720
there.

1167
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,480
>> What do you hate about being a CEO

1168
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,280
>> cuz listen, I'm telling you, there are

1169
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,440
things we all hate.

1170
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,119
>> Yes. No, it's true. You go first. Fluff

1171
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,440
this up. You go first.

1172
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,240
>> I really don't like managing people.

1173
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,280
>> Okay. Very true.

1174
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,000
>> I'm very honest about that. I'm uh I'm

1175
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,079
very creative. I'm very solution driven,

1176
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
>> especially Jenz's. And I'm very honest

1177
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,839
about that. I hate managing Gen Z's

1178
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,920
because I'm an older millennial. I'm 42

1179
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,920
years old. So, the way we were raised to

1180
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,520
work and our work ethic is very

1181
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,359
different. We will grind through

1182
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,480
anything. We're like a bull in a ch. We

1183
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,720
will go through and we're like, "Okay,

1184
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,400
we're going to go down this path." I

1185
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,000
feel like younger gen Z's especially,

1186
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,920
they just get overwhelmed really quick.

1187
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,440
They're overly sensitive generation.

1188
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,200
>> I got I got something for you and I'm

1189
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,839
going to tell you this at the risk of my

1190
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,920
future book being co-opted by someone.

1191
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,400
But I I've come up with a theory, okay?

1192
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,680
Okay? And as very similar ages, I I

1193
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,800
think you'll probably hopefully you'll

1194
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
agree. you'll tell me this is a good

1195
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,640
theory.

1196
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,800
>> I think the the the sort of moment in

1197
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,800
time that I evaluate is

1198
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,920
>> did you ever use Map Quest?

1199
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,640
>> Yes.

1200
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,040
>> And if you think about that, did you or

1201
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,280
did you not use Map Quest is the perfect

1202
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,800
divide from a leadership standpoint

1203
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,079
because and then people always get mad

1204
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,440
at me when I say that and they say, "Oh,

1205
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,560
you're being, you know, aegis or

1206
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,119
something." And I go, "No, no, no,

1207
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,200
>> no, no.

1208
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,960
>> It allows me to understand how I'm going

1209
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,520
to lead you if you haven't used Map

1210
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,040
Quest." Correct. Because, you know, now

1211
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,800
I happened to be this week. I used to

1212
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,640
use Map Quest and I had to think,

1213
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,400
>> you know, with with Google Maps, I just

1214
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,839
followed, you know, the directions and

1215
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,520
often make a mistake and then be like,

1216
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:00,320
"Oh, the the Google maps messed it up."

1217
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,480
No, I I didn't. I did that. So, I I use

1218
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,160
that as a reference point to say I've

1219
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,640
I've really honed in on different

1220
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,480
generations, different individuals need

1221
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,560
different things from a leader. Correct.

1222
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,920
How I coach them, how I manage them is

1223
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,160
going to be different. Maybe the Map

1224
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,800
Quest line isn't perfect, but it's been

1225
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,640
really useful for me. good direction. I

1226
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,240
I would agree with that because I think

1227
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,640
like you just said with the Map Quest

1228
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,760
example, some of we are just built a

1229
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,280
little bit tougher. We're like, "Okay,

1230
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,720
we will blame ourselves and we'll say,

1231
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,920
listen, you messed up. Let's go back to

1232
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,640
the drawing board."

1233
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,040
>> I feel that the non-map quest generation

1234
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,320
sometimes is overly sensitive, like this

1235
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
is work. It's okay.

1236
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,400
>> You're adopting my non-map quest

1237
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,160
generation.

1238
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,000
>> Yeah. I'm like, it's just work. Don't

1239
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,359
take things so personally. And I do

1240
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,520
think there's a there's sort of a

1241
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,599
different expectation of what work is

1242
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,960
and how what it what it represents

1243
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,040
certainly generationally. I think that's

1244
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,440
been true in other generational changes

1245
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,520
too. And I mean I remember you know

1246
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,920
growing up earlier in my career and the

1247
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,680
generation behind me or you know before

1248
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,040
me I should say was shocked that you

1249
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,319
might leave a company every couple of

1250
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,880
years right so you think about the

1251
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,880
generation

1252
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,880
>> how much we shifted right totally. I

1253
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,400
think it's also about very intuitive

1254
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,040
leadership and men and women obviously

1255
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,520
lead very differently but still it's

1256
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,040
about knowing what's your mission what

1257
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,960
is your purpose and some people will

1258
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,200
stick around for that for three four

1259
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,960
five 10 years and some people won't last

1260
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,480
more than a few months but you are not

1261
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,319
meant to shift your mission and your

1262
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,599
purpose to adopt every single employee

1263
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,359
who comes to the door I'm sorry

1264
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,800
>> and more importantly I think on that

1265
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:31,359
note I would say as the leader it's

1266
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,960
really incredibly valuable to explain

1267
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,800
that and share what you need to be

1268
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,400
successful. One of the things, you know,

1269
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,839
we I often get into conversations

1270
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,640
around, you know,

1271
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,960
>> the remote versus not, you know, reality

1272
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,960
that, you know, since co um I know

1273
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,400
plenty of companies that are only

1274
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,880
remote, right? Remote first and that

1275
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,520
works for them.

1276
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,720
>> Yeah.

1277
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,160
>> What I've stopped uh uh trying to

1278
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,440
articulate is what works for Daily

1279
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,359
Harvest. Right now, I'm the leader of

1280
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,720
Daily Harvest and what works for me is a

1281
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,160
particular what might work for

1282
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,319
>> and actually but sharing that out loud

1283
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,319
is is such a powerful tool as a leader.

1284
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,079
I again I I go back to this sort of

1285
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,119
authenticity and transparency for

1286
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,640
leaders

1287
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,040
>> um used to mean something else, right?

1288
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,839
Like the idea of the CEO sitting in the

1289
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,920
the boardroom like very difficult. Yeah.

1290
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,319
I want you to know who I am. I want you

1291
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,119
to know how I work. I want you to know

1292
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,040
you know how I am successful because if

1293
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,640
I if you know that then it's that much

1294
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,440
easier for you to decide one do you want

1295
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,000
to be here and then two if you do how

1296
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,319
we're going to work together.

1297
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,800
>> How we going to work together? So I both

1298
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,119
the companies that I run um am the

1299
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,440
founder and CEO of are both all female.

1300
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,880
Yeah.

1301
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,359
>> And one of the things I started doing is

1302
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,760
when I'm hiring women is like I was like

1303
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,079
I hate I like transparency. I

1304
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,440
like authenticity. You cannot be scared

1305
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,200
to come up to me. I'm a strong

1306
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,119
personality. But I need you to voice

1307
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,640
your opinion. And if you need to push me

1308
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,240
back, you need to push me back because I

1309
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,599
will respect you more for that.

1310
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,760
>> If you're somebody who's a little too

1311
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,119
shy and too nervous to say your point of

1312
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,880
view, then this is not the place for

1313
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,079
you. and being upfront about it.

1314
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,520
>> I'm very upfront about it. I was like,

1315
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,400
that is the energy and that energy does

1316
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,880
not work for everybody.

1317
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,359
>> Yeah.

1318
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,800
>> And you're either sold into the dream

1319
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,280
>> and you're here to build it with us and

1320
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,319
you're here to voice yourself

1321
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,240
>> or you're not.

1322
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,720
>> Curiosity and conviction. I go back to

1323
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,319
it. Yeah.

1324
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,800
>> And again, I I've

1325
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,560
>> for the last number of years, I I have

1326
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,359
found myself coming back to those two

1327
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,160
words. Yeah.

1328
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,440
>> Because it allows people to really

1329
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,599
understand what it is you're looking

1330
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,520
for. And I think that people, you know,

1331
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,760
have this false sense that you work for

1332
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,160
a founder or a CEO. It's like you're

1333
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,440
just working hard on on their behalf.

1334
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,400
>> Yeah. No, you're not. You're also

1335
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,319
growing yourself.

1336
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,560
>> And there was a there's a reason behind

1337
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,200
it.

1338
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,599
>> Yeah. And I think every single job, if I

1339
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,119
look back at my career, every single job

1340
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,960
has taught me such an important skill

1341
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,359
set. Every boss that I've had has taught

1342
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,359
me something so imperative that worked

1343
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,640
out later in life, you know? And so when

1344
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,160
you're working somewhere and I always

1345
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,760
encourage the girls, the women who are

1346
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,040
working for us, be like there's a lot

1347
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,640
for you to learn here. This is about

1348
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,000
your career. It's about your growth as

1349
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,040
well. Don't just think you're working

1350
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,680
here for me. You're doing this for

1351
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,599
yourself.

1352
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,040
>> So um one of the things I'm maybe most

1353
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,000
proud of in my eight years at Daily

1354
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,800
Harvest is we have a very strong alumni

1355
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,520
network.

1356
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,240
>> Amazing.

1357
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,480
>> Both formally and informally in that,

1358
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,920
you know, I stay very connected to a lot

1359
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,800
of our former team members whether they

1360
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,040
work for me directly or not. And what I

1361
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,599
have found is the the sort of strength

1362
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,920
of your alumni and how prideful you are

1363
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,040
of them. Absolutely. Is a great sign of

1364
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,480
whether or not you're going to get more

1365
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,599
people to come and work for you in the

1366
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,960
future. Right. Some of our biggest fans

1367
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,760
are are XT members.

1368
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,760
>> Yeah. Employees.

1369
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,040
>> And I always say, you know, not every

1370
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:38,560
company is going to be able to scale

1371
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,160
forever in a way that your next job is

1372
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,040
definitely going to happen inside the

1373
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,200
company. Yeah,

1374
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,200
>> I've always looked at my ability to get

1375
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,800
people the next role externally as a

1376
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,400
huge measure of my success.

1377
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,839
>> I look at some of our, you know, people

1378
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,440
who worked for us previously that have

1379
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,560
gone on to do amazing things or I've

1380
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,000
introduced, I was like, this might not

1381
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,200
be a fit or you might have hit your cap

1382
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,880
here, but let me introduce to you

1383
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,960
another company that you do amazing.

1384
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,520
>> And it's fun, there's often times when

1385
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,720
I've done that and people are sort of

1386
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,680
shocked at first, right? Because it's

1387
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,960
like, wait, are you trying to get rid of

1388
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,640
me? It's like, no, no, absolutely not.

1389
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,319
>> For your own, I'm trying to get you the

1390
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,400
next opportunity and then we'll figure

1391
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,040
this out together, right? But the

1392
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,720
reality is I think I it always comes

1393
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,599
back to are you just being that open

1394
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,400
with individuals?

1395
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,880
>> Right. Of course.

1396
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,480
>> You know when you when you demand you

1397
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,920
know transparency and you demand

1398
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,480
engagement you better show up with that

1399
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,560
yourself.

1400
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,079
>> Absolutely. How do you manage burnout?

1401
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,240
>> Have you ever had burnout? Like

1402
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,359
>> I've definitely had burnout. Okay. I

1403
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,160
think we all have

1404
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,800
>> as founders. Yeah.

1405
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,560
>> Yes. Um

1406
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,599
>> as CEOs all of it. Yeah. As leadership.

1407
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:41,440
Um, I I look,

1408
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,119
>> travel and and true vacation are truly

1409
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,520
the only thing that I I've ever been

1410
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,839
able to say actually does the solution,

1411
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,319
right?

1412
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,839
>> Um, so that's not always available.

1413
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,960
>> Are you able to tune out on holiday

1414
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,880
completely or no?

1415
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,040
>> So, for whatever reason, if I can get to

1416
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,160
Europe, that's the answer.

1417
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,079
>> All warning to yourself.

1418
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,480
>> That's the answer. Um, well, I think

1419
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,800
it's also just being I say Europe, but

1420
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,599
really I mean international travel as a

1421
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,319
whole

1422
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:09,200
>> is is a way to sort of you you almost

1423
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:10,560
have to be uh tuned out because you're

1424
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,520
in a different culture in a different

1425
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,760
society entirely. Um,

1426
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,079
>> you never fully tune out. You know that,

1427
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,599
right? You can't. Um, but part of that

1428
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,240
is how you trust your team. And if your

1429
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,079
team sees you, you know, let go during

1430
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,760
that time period, they wanna they want

1431
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,480
to show up and work hard for you, too.

1432
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,599
So I try to remember that one small

1433
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:35,839
thing that I've really tried um uh to

1434
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:38,079
sort of come back to is is food. Um so

1435
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,480
again, not everyone loves to cook. Um so

1436
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,880
you don't have to cook, but I I come

1437
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,880
back to if I'm really feeling it, I'm

1438
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,040
going to prioritize, you know, getting a

1439
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,119
couple friends together for dinner,

1440
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,720
ideally at someone's home. You know,

1441
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,720
going out to dinner, particularly I live

1442
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,079
in New York City. You could never You

1443
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,400
could go every night to a different

1444
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,160
restaurant.

1445
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,160
>> You still have options. Correct.

1446
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,240
>> Stopping being in your apartment or

1447
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,040
someone else's your home and actually

1448
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,839
sharing food, connecting over stories,

1449
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,920
laughing, crying, whatever it may be.

1450
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:10,079
>> Those are the Yeah, it's it's healing in

1451
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,079
a way that sort of rebounds you quicker

1452
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,560
than you realize from from feeling

1453
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,720
stressed and burnt out. Um, but man, if

1454
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,640
we come up with the uh the solution to

1455
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,240
burnout, we've got the next opportunity.

1456
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,480
>> That's it. That's a new longevity hack

1457
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,319
that everybody will want to buy into. I

1458
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,079
just wanted to leave I I've just loved

1459
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,440
getting to know you as a CEO because you

1460
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,960
know we bring on so many founders and

1461
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,079
CEOs but sometimes really diving into

1462
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,520
what is your strategy, how have you

1463
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,960
scaled, how have you built your team is

1464
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,359
always interesting to peel back the

1465
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,440
layer because then you really understand

1466
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,440
the company because you understand the

1467
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,119
people behind it.

1468
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,359
>> If there was one piece of advice you'd

1469
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,400
leave our guests with if they want to

1470
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,079
build something in the health and

1471
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,960
wellness page, they want to get started,

1472
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:53,280
what would that be? So I think there's a

1473
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:56,240
lot of space for brands to collaborate

1474
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,480
and so one advice I would give is you

1475
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,640
know people talk about white space

1476
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:04,560
opportunities from innovation

1477
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,640
>> you know first two or novel this I think

1478
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,319
if you really break down what works for

1479
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,560
health and wellness it comes always

1480
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:13,119
comes back to the basics right are you

1481
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,119
getting the nutrition you need are you

1482
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,359
getting sleep right it's the basics that

1483
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,160
matter and so if you conviction that

1484
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:22,480
you've got an idea, a product, a service

1485
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,200
that's going to be additive

1486
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,760
>> for any size audience.

1487
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,319
>> Go after it.

1488
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,400
>> Yeah.

1489
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,319
>> And don't be afraid to partner with

1490
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,599
people even if they seem like

1491
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,160
competitors.

1492
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,400
>> Absolutely.

1493
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,559
>> My background is operations and so I'm

1494
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,720
I'm it's a little bit more true in the

1495
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,240
ops world where you go every week you're

1496
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,920
having conversations where like why are

1497
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,280
we all solving the same problem, right?

1498
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,839
>> What does it look like to support each

1499
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,839
other

1500
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,520
>> and share that information? Yeah,

1501
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,920
>> I also think it's so terrible when

1502
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,440
people want to gatekeep and they don't

1503
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,559
want to empower somebody else to learn

1504
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,079
or do better. And I think sharing your

1505
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,680
challenges or hiccups or things that

1506
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,040
you've struggled with and if you can

1507
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,280
help another founder, help another

1508
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,359
business, that is how and just good

1509
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,760
energetic exchange. That's how you give

1510
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,000
back.

1511
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,240
>> You give back and honestly it's mentor

1512
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,200
other people what that what doors unlock

1513
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,800
when you do that.
